<p>Ever started your day in the office with a rude shock? I mean, shock in the literal sense. I’ve discovered that being a good chap who switches off his monitor before calling it a day (to save power!) has its disadvantages, especially if he is a ..err..&lsquo;static electric&rsquo; person – someone who gets a shock even before he touches the metal switch to turn on the power. If I were a man of action I’d be benumbed for a second, taken aback by the momentary loss of sense before coming to terms with things around. But no..I’m what you could call as a man of dreams (If you ever catch me smiling/laughing/angered/dull or exhibiting some out-of-the-place emotion while idly walking on some road alone, be not alarmed, you’ve not lost me). So, this shock is usually a jolt from the dreamy-unreal-fantasy world to the present. It’s as though some one’s stopped me on my tracks.. &ldquo;Boy. It’s time, time to work. Ready .. Steady .. Go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>9.30 AM</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Yes. Time to work. Do one thing at a time, I tell myself. No dreaming and letting the mind wander. I let my mind and fingers take over me.</p>
<p><strong>11.00 AM</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My fingers are tapping the unfortunate keyboard incessantly and furiously. I suddenly stop. Something is disturbing me. What is it ? I look back. Sheesh ! someone’s opened the darn window. The wind’s blowing. I go towards it and before I even touch it …trrrr.. I get a shock . I look here and there. To see if someone saw. None. I close the window. pull the strings down.</p>
<p><strong>1.00 PM</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I’m hungry. But V likes lunch only after 1.30 ..closer to 2.00 if he has urgent work. So I decide to grab a coke in the meanwhile. I tell myself – ‘This coke machine always gives me shock. But not this time’. So to ‘discharge’ static electricity off me, I touch everything around, the chair, the phone, the table and set off. On the way I think – ‘anyway I’ve got up. Let me take a leak’. 100 out of 100 times I meet up with a few friends in the restroom. We come out of it, talk this and that and head to the pantry. N goes for apple juice, S goes for pepsi and I go for coke. The moment I touch the ‘diet coke’ button, a shiver runs though my fingers. Duh ! so much for my preparation.</p>
<p><strong>4.00 PM</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I sense a presence. It is A, a Mangalore chap. (Why in the world did they change Bangalore to Bengalooru? Why not name Mangalore as Mengalooru? To the kannada deprived, “Men-gala-ooru = town of men” Well ! May be the name is reserved for future men-only cities which could spawn up due to the high rate of female infanticide). I try to shake hands with him and you know what happened (by this time you are the i-know-what-happened guru). I just barely touch him and …Trrrrrrr.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A - “En siva .. electricity ittkondu oodadthiya ?”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
(“What buddy, you walk around with electricity or what ?”)</p>
<p><strong>7.00 PM</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I decide to blog the events of the day. It’s been sometime. I mean since I’ve written something. Boy, whatta day. Someone could as well say &ldquo;Robin, I think of you and I see sparks flying!&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I take a walk. Conjure up what to write and bingo !</p>
<p>ps: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Wouldn’t it be fanciful to visualize me sitting in a place for a long time, building up so much of static electricity that with a stroke of a finger, I could light a bulb. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
That’d be pretty cool.</p>
<p>pps :<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Gosh ! why do I never talk like an engineer ? I might be the only engineer who limits logical reasoning only to work and nothing beyond ..that too only if I’m asked to! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Forget that.. Why does this happen ? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The actual reason(s) could be one or many of<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
a. dry skin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
b. clothes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
c. complete lack of moisture in the air<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
d. what-ever-you-want-to-assume to amuse yourself</p>
