<p>The first thing that I did was to watch the rest of &lsquo;The Sound of Music'<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The &lsquo;favourite things&rsquo; song was still afresh in my mind. I&rsquo;d watched it till Maria stealthily ran away to the abbey. D had said it was the best of movies ! must-watch-should-not-be-missed kind of movie. It is a musical about a wannabe nun being a governess in a Captains house (palace!) gaining the confidence of his 7 kids. It’s a classic. It’s a jolly ride, I’d say – jolly roller coaster musical flow in and out of good times.</p>
<p>By the time I finished everyone was awake.. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
N, reading paper – &ldquo;They’ve opened a new park near downtown. Let’s go.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Me – &ldquo;Yup..I anyway needed to go to the library.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
N – “ok. We’ll cook something, take it and eat it from there.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Me – “We’ll eat here and then go there. I don’t like to eat in open spaces.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
N – “It’ll be cool to eat in the park. It’ll be like a picnic. We’ll eat there.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>May be because I’ve seen too many parks littered with leftovers .. I don’t like to eat in parks. Aren’t parks meant to be .. I don’t know .. heaven-in-the-middle-of-rubble or something ? a serene place ? a place where you just sat silently or walked slowly or.. whatever.. well ! it’s my personal prob. I’d rather not impose my ideas into someone else.</p>
<p>I went to the library .. and to my surprise saw that there was a book sale going on there. Bought some books. That kind of put me back into good spirits. Called up N to find out if he was coming to the park. He was ready. We found the park, sat on the green grass.. Using bag as pillow I lay flat on the grass and started reading ‘message in a bottle’. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
N unpacked and had his lunch. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
After a while he turned towards me .. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“How was the sale ? what did you buy ?”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“Not many .. arnd 5.”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
N inspected . he put aside ‘Frenchman’s Creek’ , ‘Life of Pi’ …and other books. I knew his eye’d stop at Republic and it did ! ‘Plato’s Republic ! boy ! I always wanted to read it..’ He started reading it and before long, WE started reading it. The whole book’s in the form of dialogues. He read a dialogue and I the next. We played Socrates, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus alternatively .. and even as we were returning home.. we were arguing .. about ‘justice’</p>
