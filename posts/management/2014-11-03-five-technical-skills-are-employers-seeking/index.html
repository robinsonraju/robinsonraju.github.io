<p>Before jumping directly into technical skills, let us briefly look at the current climate in the world of Information Technology. The current trend is that more companies are trying to recruit new grads. There was a time when companies would want only professionals. More the experience, more the degrees and certificates you had, more sought after you were. But that trend is changing. In an ever changing world, what is required is not someone who has deep expertise in a specific area but someone who can acquire skills fast.</p>
<p>Top 5 skills according to me would be</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to work in a team</li>
<li>Ability to make decisions and prioritize work</li>
<li>Ability to communicate well</li>
<li>Technical competence in the domain that the company works in</li>
<li>Domain knowledge and passion to work</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, technical competence is #4. I’d say that an intelligent person with strong fundamentals can pick up technology pretty fast. Also the technology landscape keeps changing and what is relevant today may not be so tomorrow. So a list of ‘hot technical skills’ today in 2014 may not be relevant to someone who might read this in the future.</p>
<p>From my experience, the top technical skills are the following. They are not specific languages per se but areas that an average engineer should be aware of. So a Front end engineer who knows basics of deploying in the cloud, programming for mobile and take care of security would be greatly in demand.</p>
<p>From my experience, the top technical skills are the following. They are not specific languages per se but areas that an average engineer should be aware of. So a Front end engineer who knows basics of deploying in the cloud, programming for mobile and take care of security would be greatly in demand.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Front end web development</strong> – Long gone is the time when the meat of programming was done in the backend and front end was just a layer to show the data using HTML, JSP ..etc. Recent years have seen an explosion of front-end technologies and frameworks – HTML5, bootstrap.js ..etc have enabled smart engineers to create amazing web applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile development</strong> – iOS or Android – E-commerce on mobile has been growing steadily and has outpaced web in many categories. With the advent of IPad and wearables, apps on devices make more money than corresponding websites. So this is a highly sought after skill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Scientist / Analyst</strong> – Another area that is growing very fast is Machine learning and data mining. Companies are accumulating petabytes of user and item data and need to have intelligent systems to mine relevant information to recommend useful items to customers. So if there are engineers who know R language or Classification and clustering techniques, they are in high demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong> – In today’s age, an average engineer is expected to know how to provision an Amazon EC2 instance and deploy code to it. Automating the process of provisioning and depoyment, creating an internal cloud, growing or reducing machine pool size on demand ..etc are key skill that are sought after.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong> – Computer security is another key area that is growing rapidly. Security in the cloud and mobile devices is a niche area at the moment. Every company now seeks engineers who know basics of security and also engineering who are experts in the area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
