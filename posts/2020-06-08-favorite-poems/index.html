    <i><p>I shot an arrow into the air,<br>
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br>
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight<br>
Could not follow it in its flight.</p>
<p>I breathed a song into the air,<br>
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br>
For who has sight so keen and strong,<br>
That it can follow the flight of song?</p>
<p>Long, long afterward, in an oak<br>
I found the arrow, still unbroke;<br>
And the song, from beginning to end,<br>
I found again in the heart of a friend.</p>

    <i><p>As you set out for Ithaka<br>
hope your road is a long one,<br>
full of adventure, full of discovery.<br>
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:<br>
you’ll never find things like that on your way<br>
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,<br>
as long as a rare excitement<br>
stirs your spirit and your body.<br>
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them<br>
unless you bring them along inside your soul,<br>
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.</p>
<p>Hope your road is a long one.<br>
May there be many summer mornings when,<br>
with what pleasure, what joy,<br>
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;<br>
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations<br>
to buy fine things,<br>
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br>
sensual perfume of every kind—<br>
as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br>
and may you visit many Egyptian cities<br>
to learn and go on learning from their scholars.</p>
<p>Keep Ithaka always in your mind.<br>
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.<br>
But don’t hurry the journey at all.<br>
Better if it lasts for years,<br>
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,<br>
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,<br>
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.</p>
<p>Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.<br>
Without her you wouldn&rsquo;t have set out.<br>
She has nothing left to give you now.</p>
<p>And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.<br>
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,<br>
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.</p>

    <i><p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,</p>
<p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.</p>

    <i><p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  <br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;  <br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  <br>
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  <br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;  <br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  <br>
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  <br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>

That floats on high o&rsquo;er vales and hills,<br>

A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
<p>Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
<p>The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br>
In such a jocund company:<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>
<p>For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.</p>

    <i><p>No man is an island,<br>
Entire of itself,<br>
Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
A part of the main.</p>
<p>If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
Europe is the less.<br>
As well as if a promontory were.<br>
As well as if a manor of thy friend&rsquo;s<br>
Or of thine own were:</p>
<p>Any man&rsquo;s death diminishes me,<br>
Because I am involved in mankind,<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
It tolls for thee.</p>

    <i><p>How does a part of the world leave the world?<br>
How does wetness leave water?</p>
<p>Dont&rsquo; try to put out fire by throwing on<br>
more fire! Don&rsquo;t wash a wound with blood.</p>
<p>No matter how fast you run, your shadow<br>
keeps up. Sometimes it&rsquo;s in front!</p>
<p>Only full overhead sun diminishes your shadow.<br>
But that shadow has been serving you.</p>
<p>What hurts you, blesses you. Darkness is<br>
your candle. Your boundaries are your quest.</p>
<p>I could explain this, but it will break the<br>
glass cover on your heart, and there&rsquo;s no fixing that.</p>
<p>You must have shadow and light source both.<br>
Listen, and lay your head under the tree of awe.</p>
<p>When from that tree feathers and wings sprout on you,<br>
be quieter than a dove. Don&rsquo;t even open your mouth for even a coo.</p>

  <p>
    <i><p>Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching.<br>
And he said:</p>
<p>No man can reveal to you aught<br>
but that which already lies<br>
half asleep in the dawning<br>
of your knowledge.</p>
<p>The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple,<br>
among his followers,<br>
gives not of his wisdom<br>
but rather of his faith and his lovingness.</p>
<p>If he is indeed wise he does not bid<br>
you enter the house of his wisdom,<br>
but rather leads you<br>
to the threshold of your own mind.</p>
<p>The astronomer may speak to you<br>
of his understanding of space,<br>
but he cannot give you<br>
his understanding.</p>
<p>The musician may sing to you<br>
of the rhythm which is in all space,<br>
but he cannot give you the ear which arrests<br>
the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it.</p>
<p>And he who is versed in the science of numbers<br>
can tell of the regions of weight and measure,<br>
but he cannot conduct<br>
you thither.</p>
<p>For the vision of one man lends not<br>
its wings to another man.<br>
And even as each one of you stands<br>
alone in God’s knowledge,<br>
so must each one of you be<br>
alone in his knowledge of God<br>
and in his understanding of the earth.</p>

  <p>
    <p>YOU have no enemies, you say?
Alas! my friend, the boast is poor;
He who has mingled in the fray
Of duty, that the brave endure,
Must have made foes! If you have none,	    <br>
Small is the work that you have done.
You’ve hit no traitor on the hip,
You’ve dashed no cup from perjured lip,
You’ve never turned the wrong to right,
You’ve been a coward in the fight.</p>
