        <description>Happened to watch the first 3 episodes of Raised by Wolves1. I was expecting just an episode to get launched in the typical HBO fashion. But getting 3 episodes was a bonus.</description>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of migrating the site to a new theme which had a better font than I had. Also wanted a smaller font to cover lot of text in a smaller area.</description>

        <description>One of the things that I wanted to do this year was to focus a bit more on writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve had times when I wrote in bursts, and I always told myself - Yeah, this is great.</description>

        <description>While I was walking down the memory lane yesterday, I remembered meeting RR in Chennai and his gift of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. We were best friends in school and I had lost touch with him during engineering.</description>

        <description>Reading &amp;ldquo;The Proof of Heaven&amp;rdquo; by Dr. Eben Alexander is almost like experiencing the NDE that he went through, to really be at the hospital with him where his loved ones were holding his hand 24/7 while he was in a coma, to be with him while he went through the underground, the gateway and the core back and forth experiencing the bright light and the melodious songs and the angelic being, to be able to hear with the whole being without anyone talking, to be able to see without physical eyes, to not have a concept of time, to feel a divine presence and be overjoyed to the fullest.</description>

        <description>More than a year whizzed past without me writing anything here.
When you&amp;rsquo;re working for a company that does more than double the work in less than half the time that the client does it in and if the client happens to be this uber-fast techie company that rolls out 8 million lines of code once every 2 weeks with almost 50K lines of code changing every week, time is a pricey quantity.</description>

        <description>I’m lying flat on my back and looking at the open sky. It is clear. There are no stars. Only a single moon.
Is the queen of the night sky smiling at me ?</description>

        <description>Re-lived a wonderful moment when I accidentally read one of my old scribblings.
 There are some places where the moment you go, you feel completely at ease ; you’d stay, transfixed with a longing in your heart to be left there forever!</description>

        <description>Some days you get up slowly ..
sit or sometimes sit n sleep on the bed for sometime ..
wait for thoughts to gather, slowly come into terms with the world – as though you need time to gradually transition from one world to completely different one – as though you just came out of water and you’re gasping for breath.</description>

        <description>Though sleeping, reading and watching movies were the only major things that I did during this weekend, what I really wanted to do was to go to a beach, write something, put it into a bottle and throw it into the sea.</description>
