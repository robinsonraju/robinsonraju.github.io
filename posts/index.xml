        <description>&amp;ldquo;When you are visited by chaos and swallowed up; when nature curses you or someone you love with illness; or when tyranny rends asunder something of value that you have built, it is salutary to know the rest of the story. All of that misfortune is only the bitter half of the tale of existence, without taking note of the heroic element of redemption or the nobility of the human spirit requiring a certain responsibility to shoulder.</description>

        <description>People did not understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than previously ..&amp;quot;
~ The Metamorphosis from Franz Kafka1
 Metamorphosis is a short novel that you can finish reading in a few hours. But those few hours can truly set you thinking for several days.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;I would have to learn to live in a different way, seeing death as an imposing itinerant visitor but knowing that even if I&amp;rsquo;m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.&amp;rdquo;
~ Paul Kalanithi, When Breath Becomes Air 1
 I first read about this book through Gates Notes2, where Bill Gates mentions that the book left him in tears.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Any fool can tell a crisis when it arrives. The real service to the state is to detect it in embryo.&amp;rdquo;
~ Foundation by Isaac Asimov 1
 This is the second time I&amp;rsquo;m reading this book, that too after a gap of around 20 years. I had forgotten so much of the book that it felt like I was reading a new book.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Proof is what lies at the heart of maths, and is what marks it out from other sciences. Other sciences have hypotheses that are tested against experimental evidence until they fail, and are overtaken by new hypotheses. In maths, absolute proof is the goal, and once something is proved, it is proved forever, with no room for change.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Like matter and antimatter, in the presence of unplanned work, all planned work ignites with incandescent fury, incinerating everything around it.&amp;rdquo;
~ Gene Kim, The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win1
 The book makes the case for proper planning, rigor, and discipline as an antidote to getting out of the impossible quagmire of technical debt, tightly coupled systems and unachievable product deadlines.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Teams that are best at DevOps and continuous delivery can release software thousands of times more quickly and with a small fraction of the defects.&amp;rdquo;
 The above quote is from Dave Farley&amp;rsquo;s review1 of &amp;ldquo;The State of DevOps&amp;rdquo; report2. It rang so true that I tweeted it. Martin Fowler responded to the original Tweet from Dave asking if there was a transcript available.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.&amp;rdquo;
~ Yuval Noah Harari, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow 1
 Thoughts As with Sapiens, Harari&amp;rsquo;s narrative is compelling. The book has a ton of facts and well researched material that he weaves into the story as a master folktale teller unraveling secrets one by one.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Combining a deep specialized knowledge in a domain with a broader understanding of the rules that govern the physical world is a rare combination that saves you time, money, and problems.&amp;rdquo;
~ &amp;ldquo;The Great Mental Models Volume 2: Physics, Chemistry and Biology&amp;rdquo;1 by Shane Parrish.
 Thoughts It was greatly fulfilling to read this book.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Optimism in a leader, especially in challenging times, is so vital. Pessimism leads to paranoia, which leads to defensiveness, which leads to risk aversion. Optimism sets a different machine in motion.&amp;rdquo;

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Daring leadership is ultimately about serving other people, not ourselves. That&amp;rsquo;s why we choose courage.&amp;rdquo;
~ From Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts.1 by BrenÃ© Brown
 Thoughts It feels super inspirational to have finished this book. The book was excellent and it felt good to know that all the people who spoke highly of BrenÃ© Brown were justified in doing so.</description>

        <description>Thoughts As I had mentioned in My Reading Journey, The Great Expectations was one of the first novels I read. I&amp;rsquo;ve read it so many times over the years, each time taking something away more than before.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m reading it after The Return of the Native and can&amp;rsquo;t help but compare the approaches of Hardy and Dickens.</description>

        <description>Thoughts This was the first Thomas Hardy novel that I&amp;rsquo;d read, probably during my engineering days, and re-reading it brings a lot of memories back. What I realize is that I got the gist of the story but had missed out on a lot of details that Hardy provides. Nevertheless, I had become a fan of Hardy and ended up reading almost all of his books other than Jude the Obscure.</description>

        <description>As a person who loves checking off items in &amp;rsquo;to-do&amp;rsquo; lists and checklists, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked books that have a list of rules/principles. Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.</description>

        <description>Thoughts If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a sweeping introduction to all the various products under the Google Cloud umbrella, this is definitely the one you need to go through. The spectrum of offerings and the span that they cover amazed me. I had the knowledge of a few things - like GCE, App Engine, etc.</description>

Was reminded of that again when I read today&amp;rsquo;s WSJ. The paper had a section towards the end dedicated to Cybersecurity.</description>

Thoughts There is no better time to read this book than now. We&amp;rsquo;re at a point in history where were have examples of massive data breaches in the past to study from, and also an unprecedented number of businesses going online at a rapid pace, accelerated by shelter-in-place rules enforced to stem the spread of covid-19 virus.</description>

        <description>Came across a list of Threat Models in a book on Zero Trust Networks that I just started reading. I had heard of two models in the past - STRIDE and DREAD in the context of security thread classification and ranking for Cyber-physical systems Seifert &amp;amp; Reza (2016).
Before going into the popular models, what is Threat Modeling?</description>

        <description>This is an excellent course. It is a great refresher of a lot of cybersecurity concepts that most engineers might have heard of but not know. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know much, it would be much more useful since you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better knowledge of the attack vectors and all vulnerabilities that surround us daily.</description>

        <description>Intro Wanted to create an API spec for brainstorming an API that we&amp;rsquo;re developing. Swagger is probably the most popular API design tool. I had used Apiary (https://apiary.io/) in the past (2013-14). It had features like defining the API spec using yaml and it getting rendered beautifully as API documentation. Nothing like a great API documentation that shows different methods, parameters, objects, input/output status codes and even a server/sandbox to try it out.</description>

        <description>The optimism around cybersecurity was dampened today by a news article on WSJ - &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Startups Feel a Pinch on Funding and Sales&amp;rdquo;.
 Cybersecurity startups are finding they have to do more with less, as the economic drag of coronavirus precautions makes it difficult to sell their products and enlist new customers while it simultaneously diminishes the size of their funding rounds, investors say.</description>

        <description>Starting to read up on blockchain. RV mentioned that I might need to learn Go if I need to tryout some HyperLedger frameworks in the future. Go has a cool playground to try things online and a tour which teaches you basics.
Rather than looking at them, I wanted to look at some actual code and infer how things work.</description>

        <description>Instead of remembering to build and push to GitHub, wanted to automate it. The steps are simple enough to write a script and have a cron job execute it.
The steps from the post on Setting up hugo site and publishing to github are below
cd &amp;lt;site directory&amp;gt; hugo cd &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;.</description>

        <description>A couple of years back, I chanced upon an article where someone was describing how simple it was to set up a static website using Ghost. That made me think if I should explore moving from Jekyll to something newer. New frameworks keep coming up and it probably is a good idea to shift to keep up.</description>

        <description>I read this book on the way to and during the Alaska Trip that we took during last winter (2019). Read on the flight from SF to Portland and from there to Anchorage. The bulk of the reading was done during the full-day train journey from Anchorage to Fairbanks on the 3rd day of the trip.</description>

        <description>I read this book on the way back from our Alaska Trip during during last winter (2019). The trip itself was magical since it was like going to a different land that I&amp;rsquo;ve only seen in movies or read in books. Read the book in Fairbanks airport, in the flight from Fairbanks to Anchorage, Anchorage airport, in the flight from Anchorage to Portland, Portland airport and in the flight from Portland to SFO.</description>

        <description>There are some novels that start slowly, and build up momentum as we progress through the story. And there are others that start with a bang. &amp;lsquo;Of love and other demons&amp;rsquo; is definitely in the latter category.
The books opens with a letter from Marquez on how he came upon the story.</description>

        <description>Jordan Peterson is one of those people who does not mince words. When you listen to his talks on YouTube, you always come back a little more pumped up and motivated than before. You also get a feeling that you&amp;rsquo;ve not been doing enough and need to step up and take more responsibilities.</description>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;d always wanted to read a novel by Neal Stephenson. Back in 2005, NC had mentioned him as a great author who wrote cyber thrillers and I should definitely read. Time passed by, I forgot about this and when someone recently mentioned Stephenson in a chat about books, I thought I must get hold of a copy.</description>

        <description>This is probably the 3rd time I&amp;rsquo;m reading this book. Got this book when I attended Payments 101 &amp;amp; 201 by Glenbrook in Jan/Feb 2015. It was just a couple of days but was one of the best courses I&amp;rsquo;ve attended. It is simple, easy to read and helps to connect with a lot of projects that I deal with on a daily basis.</description>

        <description>This is a great book. You can open any page and random and find tidbits that immediately resonate with you. It has so many &amp;ldquo;I should be doing this, I should have done this, This is super advice&amp;rdquo; kind of messages. I had given it as a gift to my manager and he said he&amp;rsquo;s read it over 50 times!</description>

        <description>I like the writing style of Malcom Gladwell. With enchanting short real-life stories and fascinating anecdotes, he takes you right into the book, to a different world where you are a student who is observing and studying the behavior of the people in different parts of the world, effortlessly moving to and fro through different periods of time.</description>

        <description>For someone who has been doing Java programming and reading through lot of OO codebase for over a decade, functional programming is truly a paradigm shift. It is not like learning a different language or different version of Java from Java 2 (1.2) to Java 8. The first time I was exposed to functional programming is probably around 2012 when I had to do a project for an ML course using R language.</description>

        <description>This blog is an attempt to walk through the process of using hadoop to analyze a dataset that might look similar to an actual dataset that we might encounter.
The objective is to read data from Iris dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris and calculate the mean sepal length of each class of the flower.</description>

        <description>The last blog was about how to run wordcount using the &amp;ldquo;hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar&amp;rdquo; that was automatically available in the VMs. How would it be to really write the Mapper and Reducer for this? I searched a bit for an eclipse plugin to be able to create a MR project through eclipse that would have the template for Mapper and Reducer and I would just write the implementation.</description>

        <description>Here is a small example to run Wordcount program on hadoop. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do this using Cloudera VM and also MapR Sandbox. When you start ClouderaVM, it is already loaded with desktop and you can do all the work inside the desktop - open a browser, start a terminal..etc. MapR Sandbox doesnt come with GUI, so you&amp;rsquo;d have to ssh into the machine to work on it.</description>

 Couple of weeks back we&amp;rsquo;d reviewed TTTD algorithm and an improvement of TTTD. While TTTD can chunk data according to data content and is more efficient than BSW, it has poor stability and the distribution of chunk sizes is too diverging.</description>

 My focus area right now is data chunking alogrithms. I&amp;rsquo;d jumped right into data chunking using hashing algorithms since those are popular and there are multiple papers on them.</description>

        <description>This is a review of the paper on Pattern matching in Z-compressed files. I&amp;rsquo;d done a project last year to implement LZW compression and chanced upon this paper while I was googling for some information on LZW. To see two areas that I&amp;rsquo;d worked on in the past - Data Search (Had helped build a search engine using Lucene 10 yrs back and used Solr for another project a few years back) and Data Compression come together, to know that we would be able to index data and search from compressed files without decompressing them, was very intersting and I wanted to find more information and see some implementation of this.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Introduction to Data Mining&amp;rdquo; by Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach and Vipin Kumar has been recommended to me as a great book to learn about Data Mining. Read the first chapter and it felt very inspiring as though it was beckoning me to keep at it and read more.
Thought I will capture notes as I read.</description>

        <description>There are many books that when I think back on them, I have this lingering feeling that either due to reading quickly or not taking notes, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really take in the full essence of the book. There is more to be understood and when there is time, I need to get back to it.</description>

        <description>The story starts with Makar , an aged gypsy conversing with the author. It is dark , the wind is heavy , the campfire is blazing furiously ..yet Makar , smoking his huge pipe , was unfazed. It was as though these heavy conditions never affected him.(reminds me of Vikram-Betal stories of chandamama !</description>

        <description>The âThe Kings Generalâ is unlike any novel that Iâve read. Itâs as pacy as a modern day thriller. Reminds me of âGone with the windâ though. It is about Richard Grenvile, the kingâs General in the west, the bravest amongst the brave, the lion of the times, the kingâs darling, the rebelsâ dread and about the only woman in the world he cared for : Honor Harris â a beautiful lady who was crippled just a day before their marriage in a tragic accident.</description>
