[{"content":" \u0026ldquo;The deepest lessons come out of the deepest waters and the hottest fires.\u0026rdquo;\n~ Elisabeth Elliot\n CA wildfire, Orange skies in SF Bay area, and Dune trailer It seemed like a weird coincidence that Dune]1 trailer2 got released on the same day that the skies in San Francisco turned orange3. I turned to Twitter and Google to see if it was just me! Was happy to find that many other people thought so too. Phew! It is sometimes strange to have a thought and think, \u0026lsquo;what if nobody thought that way?\u0026rsquo;. Another thing that flashed through my mind when I saw the trailer was the thought that they had cast a South Indian actor in the movie. For a moment, I thought that Duncan Idaho, played by Jason Momoa was Manoj K Jayan! Googled to find if someone thought so. Looks like no one did! But Jason Momoa looked quite different from what we saw in GoT or Aquaman.\nBack to the coincidence, yes, there were numerous tweets, memes, and articles on the same. In fact, a lot of sci-fi movies depict an alien planet like red deserts. So, looking out of the window and seeing it, in reality, was too surreal. One could draw a loose parallel to the 9/11 tragedy4. Prior to the incident, there were hundreds of movies that showed tall buildings collapsing with thrilling stunts, but when the incident happened in reality, it was shocking. The power of our imagination far too exceeds the perception of our physical senses. As virtual reality becomes more mainstream and gaming becomes very immersive and engrossing, I wonder if people could lose a sense of reality. A situation quite similar to The Matrix5.\nCalifornia - The land of Dreams, Earthquakes, Droughts, and Raging fires An article that caught my eye was titled \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Dune\u0026rsquo; trailer released as West Coast wildfires rage on, fans say Arrakis-like orange skies part of the promo\u0026quot;6. Though it was meant in jest, I think there may be many people who believe that it could well be a movie promo stunt, that it is possible to do such a thing to promote a movie, and that the technology to change an entire landscape probably exists. The Gold Rush in the 1800s paved the way to the idea of the \u0026lsquo;California Dream\u0026rsquo; to believe in the unbelievable, expecting to strike it rich at any moment, wiping the slate clean and living anew, and living freely. The state motto is \u0026ldquo;Eureka\u0026rdquo;, which reminds one of the naked Archimedes running through the streets of Syracuse7 to tell of his discovery of the relationship between the density of a substance and the amount of water it displaces. One could as well equate the neo inventors of the tech industry or space exploration or electric cars with the phrase of Eureka now. In the bubble of Silicon Valley to the north and Hollywood to the south, people are constantly creating new things, the next new software or fantasy movies with incredible visuals, using machine learning and multi-core computers, perpetuating the myth of human progress that we do not yet possess.\nShaky grounds and Raging fires That the dreams manifest and more dreams are unspooled in the background of a land that is seemingly unsafe, seems ironic. Almost the entire state is on large earthquake faults, and a major earthquake could wipe out big cities like SFO or LA at any time. Forest Fires are a recurring thing every year, and in the past few years, they have become bigger. This year over 3 million acres got burned down 8.\n Academics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California’s agency land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. 9\n Many people who experience a couple of earthquakes move to different cities since they don\u0026rsquo;t want to pin their future on shaky grounds. The first earthquake, for anyone who comes new to the area, is an experience of a lifetime. I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced a couple of small ones, all while in office, and they were over before I could react.\nBut forest fires are totally something else. It is a much more visible destructive force. It is heart rendering to see images of towns and forests completely razed to the ground by the fire. It is scary to see a raging fire. Imagining the heat and the skin burning fills the heart with dread. A city named Paradise10 got destroyed completely a couple of years back. It was a sign of what was coming for the larger paradise that is the state of California.\nCan fire be not controlled? In Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind11, Yuval Harari, a historian, tells the history of humanity in a most engaging manner like a thrilling story revealing one thing after another. He says for humans, \u0026ldquo;a significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire\u0026rdquo;. It is true. The \u0026lsquo;domestication of fire\u0026rsquo; catapulted humanity to make huge strides of progress and change the face of the Earth forever. An \u0026lsquo;Animal of No Significance\u0026rsquo;(ref: Sapiens) is now able to leave Earth and go to space, a remarkable achievement in a short amount of time.\nIn spite of all the technological progress, why are people not able to control fire? That too raging in a place like California. I guess the pandemic and the devastating forest fire this year has removed the veil and shown the reality. Thought a lot of progress has been made, we\u0026rsquo;re still on the edge of the vast sea of knowledge. There is much to learn and discover about the nature of things on Earth itself. Much to learn about the human body itself. Somehow the ability to create things virtually and seeing things in CGI in movies and TV series makes one believe that humanoid robots are already here though it is far from the case.\nThe article9 in ProPublica where the quote above is referenced from, says, \u0026ldquo;Megafires, like the ones that have ripped this year through millions of acres, will continue to erupt until we’ve flared off our stockpiled fuels. No way around that.\u0026rdquo; So, as per experts, the way to avoid massive fires, is to light smaller controlled fires. Prevention is better than cure!\nMaybe the next breakthrough is to make fire-resistant material cheaper so that homes and buildings can be constructed. That way, there is a Plan B in case fires cannot be prevented, or they go out of hand. Moreover, many of the fires are due to human errors and not naturally started. The Dragon Capsule 12 that Doug and Bob came back in, withstood temperatures of over 7000 degrees Centigrade on its entry to the atmosphere. So there is technology to build materials that are fire resistant to the extreme and could be used to build dwellings with the same.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure there are thousands of other ideas. But I think the main problem is that there are too many problems to tackle, mostly caused by people and ideologies. Also, the collective human mind is now mostly engaged in the virtual world - millions of people who are developing software as well as those who are using. The digital world is abuzz with activity - social media, gaming, online transactions, etc..\nI hope things change. Either through controlled burning or the discovery of some technology to control the spread of fire, the future would be out of the grip of uncertainty.\nHere is the sentiment from Calvin in 1989!\nCalvin and Hobbes for December 30, 1989 | https://t.co/aB03a7HeyR https://t.co/CmwkTuCR1i via @GoComics\n\u0026mdash; robinsonraju (@robinsonraju) September 20, 2020   Dune by Frank Herbert - wikipedia \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Dune 2020 film Trailer\n  \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n SF Gate Article - Thick wildfire smoke blocks sun, turns Bay Area sky orange, Verge article - The sky is on fire in San Francisco, and we flew a drone through it \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/9-11-attacks \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The Matrix Movie - wikipedia \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://meaww.com/dune-trailer-released-us-west-coast-wildfires-rage-fans-reactions-arrakis-orange-skies-compared \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#%22Eureka!%22 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.fire.ca.gov/stats-events/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://abc7news.com/timeline-of-terror-the-evacuation-of-paradise-from-beginning-to-end/4850913/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Sapiens – A Brief History of Humankind, Gates Notes on Sapiens \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-demo-2-home-port-arrival.html \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["California","Forest Fires","Dune"],"title":"Paradise on fire","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-09-19-paradise-on-fire/"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains.\u0026rdquo;\n~ Jean-Jacques Rousseau 1\n The movie - C U Soon Saw this amazing movie named C U Soon2 on Amazon Prime. The movie format was unique. Most of it was shown through video conferencing and chat. One gets to know the characters and their lives through chat messages and dialogues that happen through video apps. Chat and video have become the main medium to keep in touch with friends and family who are increasingly living in different parts of the world. That was portrayed beautifully in the movie. Clever movie-making shows cinema as not merely imitating life but extending it.\nAs a viewer, you need to be more involved in it than a normal movie since you need to read the chat messages fast, look at the expressions of the faces of the characters as they talk to each other through Duo 3. You also get to see the extreme multi-tasking that the young people of the current generation are used to (or subjected to). Jimmy, the main protagonist, is not only talking to his client at work but is also looking at the financial metrics and chatting with his girlfriend at the same time. It is like doing three things in parallel. Sometimes he even chats with his friend at the same time. Chat as a medium allows us to do multi-tasking, communicate with multiple people as well as do other things on the computer/phone.\nParallel Lives? Also, I think Gen Y has truly embraced the concept of \u0026ldquo;bringing your whole self to life\u0026rdquo;, which a generation back, was quite uncommon. People kept work and life separated and their true personalities and beliefs disjointed with work (Reminded of Wemmick in Great Expectations \u0026ldquo;The office is one thing, and private life is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me.\u0026quot;). As a generation that was born in the age of the Internet with mobile phone usage and social media being the norm, they embrace technology and live naturally in the digital world. The virtual world, many times, diverges from the real world, and sometimes people can be shocked at the reality in the same way Jimmy is shocked at finding that the real Anu is different from the online persona. I think the same thing happens to people who are living in a world of books and movies. They might be living in the Victorian age of Jane Eyre4 or thousands of years into the future in the world of Paul Atreides5. One expects to be living in an age of enlightenment and suddenly sees BLM protests and burning of buildings, it is tough to come to terms with reality.\nFahadh Faasil I was super impressed by Fahadh. Every movie of his that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in recent times has been thought-provoking, and I can\u0026rsquo;t but feel that he is a true genius. The last 3 movies of his that I saw - \u0026ldquo;Trance\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Natholi Oru Cheriya Meen Alla\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Kumbalangi Nights\u0026rdquo;, were each unique and offered perspectives unlike anything else that I\u0026rsquo;d seen. Trance was probably one of his best movies, though I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen all of his movies 6 yet. His movies cover so many aspects of human life that one can talk about each for ages. The movies cover wide-ranging themes like love, addiction, religion, commercialization of spirituality, hypermasculinity, patriarchy, poverty, rural life, city life, daydreaming, communism, and so on. Kudos to Fahadh for being the producer and playing the role of Kevin to perfection.\nThe Key message Though the movie depicted many facets of today\u0026rsquo;s life - online interactions, forming a relationship without meeting a person in person, living mostly indoors, the ability to hack into someone\u0026rsquo;s digital profile to get information that they didn\u0026rsquo;t give, the shock of dealing with real-life challenges, etc., the key take away, the moral of the story, so as to speak, was about human trafficking. People being duped with the promise of a job opportunity or better life prospects and taken to a different country to be made slaves, is the modern-day abduction. Legally or illegally, if a person goes to another country and is trapped and abused, and cannot talk about it, he/she becomes a chained non-citizen.\nThe Chained non-citizens A non-citizen is \u0026ldquo;any individual who is not a national of a State in which he or she is present.\u0026rdquo; 7 If a person is taken to a foreign country and if passport and other legal documents are taken away, then the person loses the freedom of choice and is no better than an illegal non-citizen. The person has been \u0026lsquo;trafficked\u0026rsquo;! Many people who get into the trap of trafficking are in the \u0026lsquo;jumping out of the frying pan to the fire\u0026rsquo; situation. They have come to that point in life, probably because of the culmination of a series of misfortunes. It is like you\u0026rsquo;re at the edge of a cliff of despair: no money to live, poor parents, possibly a sick parent, mounting debts. You feel checkmated from all sides, and the only option is to trust a stranger and go abroad for work. There are millions of people who are victims of trafficking worldwide. My wife is on the board of a non-profit8 that fights sex trafficking, and the stories, facts, details, and statistics that she shares with me fills me with sadness about the human condition itself. But it is not that people are facing misfortunes; the biggest tragedy is that there are always people who take advantage of such people in dire situations.\nSome statistics of trafficking are below -\n At any given time in 2016, an estimated 40.3 million people were in modern slavery. Out of the 24.9 million people trapped in forced labor, 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture; 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons in forced labor imposed by state authorities. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by forced labor, accounting for 99% of victims in the commercial sex industry, and 58% in other sectors.  ~ Source - ilo.org article 9\n   View this post on Instagram         A post shared by One Bread Foundation, Inc. (@onebreadfoundation) on Sep 10, 2020 at 2:21pm PDT\n  Why does trafficking happen? Trafficking is one of the ailments that has made the story of humanity miserable on earth. Why is there so much misery? By all accounts, things should have been so much better. Books like The Better Angels of our Nature10 and Factfulness11 do point out that the standard of living has become far better than a century ago. That the hopelessness we feel when we read about war and trafficking is due to information being more accessible. Even then, I feel that with the technological progress that humans have made, things could have been much better.\nIt is a complex issue, and there are so many causes, but the main issue could be the disparity of wealth distribution and accessibility to technological advancement and modern science. There are still places that lack the infrastructure or where basic living conditions are not good enough. Poverty and lack of basic amenities could turn people towards a life of crime to have a fighting chance to live unless they are helped. People could get pushed into poverty due to a variety of reasons. It could even be environmental issues like floods, forest fires, diseases, or even mental issues. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if we could even say that man is born free (referring to Rousseau\u0026rsquo;s quote above). Many people are already in chains depending on the place of birth. The journey of life could be a the path to freedom or further enshacklement.\nIs there a solution? There are so many philanthropists and organizations at work to help people out of poverty, but the effort seems to be not moving the needle on a large scale.\nIs a belief system the solution? If a large number of people believe that human life is the only chance that our soul has, to understand God, and to be virtuous, the only path, will that reduce misery? It has been proven over again that human beings cannot stick to a specific belief system as new ideas emerge in every generation. Religious zealotry creates more problems than it tries to solve.\nThe solution probably lies within the human intelligence itself. Technology could be advanced to provide food for every single person on earth. World hunger can be and should be solved. I think Maslow\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy of basic needs can be met by technology/machines sooner than later if more people become self-aware, understand the concept of life better, and respect each other. A lot of time and energy is spent on negativity and fights all over the world. Covid-19 proved that governments can give money to each citizen if needed. Universal basic income is not such a remote concept after all. The view that people may not be motivated to work if basic needs are met is so antiquated. All the progress that the world has seen in the last 100 years is mostly due to the relative peace that existed in the world. Peace cannot exist in a divided world. I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve come back to the same ending as the previous post on the merits of a positive and generous worldview.\n Article about Rousseau on fs.blog \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n C U Soon on Wikipedia \u0026amp; C U Soon on IMDB \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Google Duo video calling app \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Jane Eyre on Wikipedia \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Dune on Wikipedia \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Fahadh\u0026rsquo;s movies on IMDB \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Definition of Non-citizen \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n One Bread Foundation Board of Directors \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 11 Facts about Human Trafficking, ILO Stats - Trafficking \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The Better Angels of Our Nature on Wikipedia \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Factfulness: Ten Reasons We\u0026rsquo;re Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think on Wikipedia \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["Movies","Trafficking"],"title":"The Chained Non-citizens","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-09-12-the-non-citizens/"},{"content":"Happened to watch the first 3 episodes of Raised by Wolves1. I was expecting just an episode to get launched in the typical HBO fashion. But getting 3 episodes was a bonus. Though I would have preferred to just have one. It would have given enough time to think about the episode and read articles about it till the next one came.\nThis is probably the \u0026lsquo;best of times\u0026rsquo; for the sci-fi genre as a whole. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the next seasons of His Dark Materials2 and The Expanse3. The trailer for the Foundation4 series on Apple TV was awesome though I wish it were available on Prime. Also, expecting Robert Jordan\u0026rsquo;s Wheel of Time5 to be engaging and thought-provoking. Not sure if the LOTR6 TV series could better Peter Jackson\u0026rsquo;s movies, but it would be interesting to see. I wish there were more seasons of The Man in the High Castle7. Can\u0026rsquo;t believe that they are thinking of rebooting Battlestar Galactica8. There is also Dune movie9 and TV series10 on the horizon with the promise that it would be better now than all the adaptations in the past. There are many more than what someone could hope to watch. I think there is something for every science buff out there. A time of abundance indeed.\nI was impressed by \u0026lsquo;Raised by Wolves\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve liked other sci-fi movies by Ridley Scott - Alien11, Prometheus12, etc. The tech is always impressive and one is hopeful for the better future that is in store for us. But while the earlier movies had life of earth as peaceful and humans exploring distant places on the universe, this one is about humans being forced to evacuate due to strife on earth.\nIt aligns with the current divided world that we\u0026rsquo;re living in. I think, just a couple of decades ago, the majority of people were optimistic about technology and the future in general. But now, the clock seems to have dialed back to world war times. Issues like religious intolerance and racism which were solved 50 years ago or before, are in the forefront. Social media seems to have given power to the fringe elements than the average person.\nThe backdrop of \u0026lsquo;Raised by Wolves\u0026rsquo; is that humanity is fighting against each other and is on the brink of extinction. What are they fighting about? Religion of course. The atheists manage to send a small spacecraft with a couple of androids and 12 embryos to Kepler-22b, a habitable planet that is about 60 light-years from the earth. The believers of the Mithraic cult send an ark with around 1000 people to the same destination. The show starts with a nuclear explosion on earth being seen far away from the first spacecraft, which implies that earth is destroyed.\nThe belief that people will destroy earth, seems to be a foregone conclusion by a lot of thinking people. It is so sad to even think of it. My view is that no one should possess any weapon that could destroy the whole earth. But the invention cannot be undone. Humanity as a whole is immature, and now the children have big toys to wipe everything out.\nThe idealists think that a small group can run away and build a new civilization without the bigotry and narrow mindedness. The androids in RBW believe the same. They think that they could give humanity a reboot by starting afresh with 12 embryos on a new planet. But that has been tried so many times on earth itself. Wherever humans go, trouble follows sooner than later.\nI think the better bet would be to just send androids to a new planet to colonize. i.e, when AI becomes more mature. If AI reaches the 2nd level (AGI - Artificial General Intelligence) as mentioned in this Wait buy why13 article, then they may be able to independently create robots and androids.\nBut even if just androids are sent to a new planet, say Mars, they are going with morality that is being put into them by humans. Depending on which country or culture they are sent from, they could be biased. If bias by smart and efficient people on earth is so disadvantageous to the marginalized, then bias from things that are multiple times smarter would be catastrophic.\nIf AGI gets being created by consuming all the digital material available today, then we\u0026rsquo;re already on the wrong path. In the last 10 years alone with the explosion of social media, so much of junk has been put on the digital world that they don\u0026rsquo;t represent the best of humanity at all.\nI think the Plan B of going out of earth should not be a solution. People need to get ahead of the fundamental differences that exist.\nIt has been proven over and again that monarchy, fascism, communism, or any ideology that divides people is not a solution. Bigotry and hatred can only lead to destruction. Getting a better understanding and believing that humanity is one species and every person is 99.9% similar to other, is the key. Yes, a positive and generous worldview.\nAs mentioned in 21 lessons for 21st century14, secularism is a positive and active worldview. It is not opposed to religion. Secularism views morality and wisdom as the natural legacy of all humans, not something handed down from God to a specific set of humans at a point in time.\nThe Secular Ideals -\n Commitment to truth Compassion Commitment to equality Cherish Responsibility  Another aspect of films like Alien or Prometheus or TV series like The Expanse, that I like, is the belief that there is life out there. The universe is so vast. Though the probability of conditions to create life is so tiny, the universe is so vast that the probability is quite real.\nPlan B15 is a reference to Elon Musk saying couple of years back that humanity needs to have a Plan B, of either setting up a colony in the Moon or Mars, in case of World War III.\nReferences\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised_by_Wolves_(American_TV_series) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials_(TV_series) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(TV_series) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_(TV_series) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(TV_series) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(2020_film) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/dune-sisterhood-tv-series-a-go-at-warnermedia-1217286 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(2012_film) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0525512179 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://sputniknews.com/viral/201803121062437450-musk-space-travel-mars-colonization/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Plan B","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-09-05-plan-b/"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;Money is the root of all evil\u0026rdquo; took a different meaning in my mind when I read this portion (quote below) from Thinking, Fast and Slow. Set me thinking about different interactions with people in the past and different kinds of projects and people\u0026rsquo;s attitudes.\nWhat came to mind were transformations in people when the goal was changed from \u0026lsquo;doing something to benefit someone\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;doing something to meet a financial target\u0026rsquo;. That even the best of teams could set out to build a scalable platform might take shortcuts to launch something if money is the target. There is an urgency that sets in when money is the focus which makes many other things oblivious. I think companies and teams should always have users as the target rather than the revenue goal itself. It is probably better to visualize the customer and the impact that we might be having to their livelihood. That is way more empowering in my opinion. Of course, there are many companies who do this really well.\nOf course, when someone hints at money\u0026rsquo;s corrupting effects, people usually respond with Francisco d\u0026rsquo;Anconia\u0026rsquo;s speech from Atlas Shrugged or something similar that looks at it from value and effort. The speech is right in its way of looking at things, but is wrong in so many other ways. Nothing is black and white ever. If money represents value and labor, why is a disproportionate amount of money found with people who did not create value or work for it?\nOne could argue that civilization exists today (in contrast to being blown up) because, in every group of people, there are individuals who are willing to spend time and energy towards causes that are beyond themselves without expecting a reward. People are willing to compromise to maintain peace, are willing to teach others for free, willing to help the poor, willing to help the elderly, and so on. Money is not the center or the value of exchange for so many transactions. Some \u0026lsquo;mission\u0026rsquo; is. Open source software has probably added more value and raised awareness and knowledge to the average citizen on earth than proprietary software.\nAnyway, it was interesting to know that psychologists have studied this and that there are case studies and numerous examples of human behavior towards money. Also, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have to be conscious. One\u0026rsquo;s attitude towards money and thereby to other human beings could be shaped by the place and society or upbringing.\nif so much of what we do is influenced by our upbringing and by priming (from things that we see daily, say social media), it is even more important that critical thinking becomes the most important skill that needs to be taught to everyone. Use System 2. Being a person who reacts to other people\u0026rsquo;s suggestions more often than not, the message of \u0026ldquo;Use System 2\u0026rdquo; is more of an advice and admonition to me than anyone else.\nHere is the passage from the book.\nQuote  Reminders of money produce some troubling effects. Participants in one experiment were shown a list of five words from which they were required to construct a four-word phrase that had a money theme (\u0026ldquo;high a salary desk paying\u0026rdquo; became \u0026ldquo;a high-paying salary\u0026rdquo;). Other primes1 were much more subtle, including the presence of an irrelevant money-related object in the background, such as a stack of Monopoly money on a table, or a computer with a screen saver of dollar bills floating in water.\n  Money-primed people become more independent than they would be without the associative trigger. They persevered almost twice as long in trying to solve a very difficult problem before they asked the experimenter for help, a crisp demonstration of increased self-reliance. Money-primed people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time helping another student who pretended to be confused about an experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on their mind picked up fewer pencils. In another experiment in the series, participants were told that they would shortly have a get-acquainted conversation with another person and were asked to set up two chairs while the experimenter left to retrieve that person. Participants primed by money chose to stay much farther apart than their nonprimed peers (118 vs. 80 centimeters). Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone.\n  The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. \u0026hellip; living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.\n ~ Thinking, Fast and Slow2\n Reference to Priming (Priming is a phenomenon whereby exposure to one stimulus influences a response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Kahneman, Daniel.

I provided some inputs based on my experience of interviewing and hiring eng managers.\nAlso thought I\u0026rsquo;d write down notes as a way to help others who might find it useful.\nIt may not be you One of the first things that I emphasized was that though there may be many things that they could improve to do well in interviews, most of the time, it is not them. The employer may just have had too many candidates who are very good fits for the position and might even have used \u0026lsquo;Optimal Stopping\u0026rsquo; 1. So, one should keep trying. The key thing to look out would be to not have the same approach everywhere since every company, and teams within these companies are different.\nThe General Structure The structure is different in different companies. Some companies don\u0026rsquo;t hire for specific teams but for the company as a whole. In my past experience, I have done things in different ways, but mostly hired for specific teams, at least for specific orgs. It makes it easier for the recruiter to pitch to a candidate, IMHO. I generally give a paragraph to the recruiter and also explain what the job responsibilities are. As a hiring manager, I\u0026rsquo;ve always felt that I should talk to the person after the recruiter clears him/her. Ask a couple of situational questions and make time available to answer any questions. I feel like either the hiring manager or someone in leadership should talk to a person before bringing the person onsite. The time of the team is premium and should not be wasted in an onsite interview if there is a chance that the person may not work out.\nThe onsite interview itself could be varied. I would recommended doing at least 1 coding interview, 1 system design interview, 1 process/tools interview and a few (may be 3) behavioral/leadership interviews. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a chance to interview during telephone screen, I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure I\u0026rsquo;m one of the onsite interviewers. I\u0026rsquo;ll also make sure to include my manager or someone at the Sr. Dir or VP level and one of my peers if possible.\nEven as I write this, I realize that it may not be scalable for big companies who might be looking for one size fits all or a consistent approach across the company. I\u0026rsquo;m visualizing a startup or a small company where every hire matters a lot.\nSummarizing,\n Telephone/Remote  Recruiter Telephone Interview Hiring Manager Interview (could be same as 1b)   Onsite/Video  Coding Interview System Design Interview (2) Leadership Interview (3)    The Overarching goal I think the overarching goal for companies who are trying to hire a manager (including promoting within) is to see if they can find someone who would be effective in a continuous problem solving environment, someone who is brave to face challenges and mature enough to accept responsibilities. As Brene Brown says \u0026ldquo;I want to live in a world with braver, bolder leaders\u0026rdquo;. Here is a quote from \u0026ldquo;Daring Greatly\u0026rdquo; talking about the experience of leading -\n \u0026ldquo;When I think about my personal experiences with leading over the past few years, the only endeavors that have required the same level of self-awareness and equally high-level “comms plans” are being married for twenty-four years and parenting. And that’s saying something. I completely underestimated the pull on my emotional bandwidth, the sheer determination it takes to stay calm under pressure, and the weight of continuous problem solving and decision making. Oh, yeah—and the sleepless nights.\u0026quot; 2\n Different companies may follow different strategies to achieve this. A company like Amazon might give guidelines to ask questions to evaluate people based on its 14 leadership principles 3. Some may have similar frameworks or some may not. But the desire is the same.\nContinuous \u0026lsquo;problem\u0026rsquo; solving! What are the problems? They could be anything. The \u0026lsquo;problems\u0026rsquo; could be related to a production incident that needs to be handled asap, a design decision to give inputs on which path is better to meet the objectives, asked to take up a project without clear or any requirements, performance issues of the system, people related issues, setting up of goals and vision for the team that is overdue, status reports to upper management, and so on. How to deal with multiple things by prioritizing the right things at the right time is the key to being effective. Of course, there are frameworks in place in most successful companies to make sure that employees are as effective as possible. But having a dialogue is a good way to gauge a person\u0026rsquo;s experience and ability.\nInterview Questions Now, coming to the questions. There is lot of material on coding questions (say Cracking the Coding Interview or hackerrank or leetcode) and System design (lot of videos on Youtube). As far as I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, people generally tend to do well in coding questions, moderately in system design and not so well in the leadership questions. The general thinking is, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about my life, so what is there to prepare?\u0026rdquo; So they end up giving examples for scenarios which just pop up in their mind, mostly just focusing on the immediate past projects or talking in generic terms instead of giving concrete technologies or situations.\nFrom a hiring manager\u0026rsquo;s perspective, though many people say that one should go into an interview with a mindset of no-hire and then be convinced otherwise, I have always done the opposite. I interview folks who I\u0026rsquo;m impressed by their resume/project work or references and go into the interview by saying \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to hire this person unless he/she gives me a reason not to.\u0026rdquo; So, it makes all the more sense to visualize the interview at home, convince yourself that you can convince the other person and go into the interview confidently.\nI\u0026rsquo;d categorize the questions in these 5 buckets to understand different facets of the person\u0026rsquo;s ability.\n  Interest - \u0026ldquo;Why are you interested in this job?\u0026rdquo;. There are many variants of this and the main objective is to find out - What makes the person qualified for the job? Why did the person get into management? How big of a team is the person comfortable managing? What kind of challenges does the person like, etc.\n  Hiring - \u0026ldquo;What do you look for when you hire someone?\u0026rdquo;. The discussion around this area would be to find out - Does the person have experience in hiring? Does the person hire for a fit or to raise the bar? How does the person rate candidates? How does the person convince someone to join their team, etc.\n  Technical Skill - \u0026ldquo;Tell me of a time when you recommended a technology but did not get accepted?\u0026rdquo;. The discussions around this would be the find out - Is the person abreast with technology that we\u0026rsquo;re using? Does the person have a good handle on technologies that they\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned in their resume? Can the person agree/disagree logically with architects and tech leads, etc.\n  Performance Management - \u0026ldquo;Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a low performer\u0026rdquo;. The question or related question will try to find out how the person does performance management. Has the person turned around a low performer?, has the person reward a high achiever? has the person laid off anyone? etc.\n  Conflict Resolution - \u0026ldquo;Tell me about a time when two groups/individuals in your team had a conflict and you were called to mediate\u0026rdquo;. In a fast paced environment, conflict is unavoidable. Sometimes within team members but many times with other team members who may have different KPIs/OKRs, or with other groups like PMs/PgMs or Architects. Has the person been in situations to resolve conflicts? Has the person done prioritization exercises on competing goals, etc.\n  I generally would ask a question on process, especially around CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) since I think that makes a huge difference in building and maintaining highly scalable software systems.\nRegarding materials to read, I would suggest The Manager\u0026rsquo;s Path or other books mentioned in my article on Leadership - Essential Books.\nAfter the interview This section is for the interviewer rather than the interviewee. I think, taking notes is very important since it may so happen that multiple candidates are excellent and the panel might have to decide on just one person. In that case, it might be better to refer the good ones to a different team, hopefully without another round of interviews.\nAlso, the general practice in most companies is to tell the candidate that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t be selected and they can re-apply only after a year. That is totally unfair if the candidate actually did really well in the interview but preference was given to another person because that person was extraordinary in some unique way.\nIf none of the candidates do well after a series of onsite interviews, that is a red flag. It indicates an ineffective system where something in the pipeline is not proper. There may be a divergence between criteria used by recruiter vs telephone interviewer vs the onsite team.\nSome companies give an option to the candidate to do reverse interviews. Once the candidate is cleared, he/she could interview teams within the company and choose which team to join. That is such a noble and lofty thing to do. I wish more companies embrace that.\n \u0026ldquo;Secretary Problem (A Optimal Stopping Problem).\u0026rdquo; GeeksforGeeks. September 04, 2019.

Also wanted a smaller font to cover lot of text in a smaller area. Stumbled upon paperesque theme on hugo themes site. It was a simple theme with lot more focus on writing.\nSo, spent some time migrating to the new theme. It is cloudy outside due to the forest fires on Mount Diablo. It seems like winter and somehow looking out of the window and seeing an overcast sky seems to be the perfect weather to write/read or do this work.\nTrials before the migration Before the actual migration, I thought I will try out a few themes to see if something else appealed. Tried the following - bilberry, kube, loveit, mediumish, zzo. Created a new site for each (which is as easy as hugo new site abc) and added the theme there. Then copied over some of my articles to see if it worked. Some of them did, some of them didn\u0026rsquo;t, some of them didn\u0026rsquo;t look the way I expected.\nOne thing about migration of any software is that one always enters into it with optimism, thinking that it is going to be simple, just a few minutes of work of swapping one thing for another. That\u0026rsquo;s probably why most migration projects run over budget. Many times new things are discovered only after one starts the work. But it is fun, challenging and engaging work. While doing it, one might feel like it is a time sucker and want to give up but if you keep at it, the end results are quite satisfying.\nMigration to paperesque Few issues that I had to fix were the following. There was a JS error during build that I temporarily fixed by removing it from head_includes.html. There were a few shortcodes that I had created in the aurora theme that I had to bring over. Spent some time figuring out how to change the home page. Tried to use the old style of two columns with a lot of links. Then decided against it. Wanted to put that content into about.md. Was wondering how to do that and then realized that the easiest way to embed HTML into markdown file is to create a shortcode. Shortcode is a super-power in hugo. One can do a lot of wonders using that. Also, spent time figuring out how to add social media buttons on the About page. W3 schools has the easiest example to embed social media buttons.\nNext day edits - New migration to Even After having the site set up with this theme, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite happy. The original intent was to move to a theme which put the blog posts in the front. This one still had the earlier issue of a user having to navigate to the actual post by clicking twice. So migrated to another theme that I had tried in the past. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to do much for this. It had a bigger feature set than what I wanted though it didn\u0026rsquo;t have the beauty of paperesque. One thing that attracted me to theme Even was the Table of contents on the right side with highlights of the section that I was reading. So spent some more time migrating to the newer theme.\nEdits after a week - New migration to Diary The more I looked at the site, I thought the older theme was probably better. Still think that a left nav with some static details, central body with text and a right have with dynamic toc is better. At least for desktop viewing. The theme Diary gave these. Though it doesnt have social media icons, I thought it was cleaner and better. I could add the social media icons later.\nHere are some screenshots of \u0026lsquo;the before and after\u0026rsquo; of the current migrations.\nPrevious Site Home Page A blog post New Site A blog post New Site #2 A blog post Current Site A blog post ","description":"","id":5,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Migrating to a new theme","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-22-migrating-to-new-theme/"},{"content":"One of the things that I wanted to do this year was to focus a bit more on writing. I\u0026rsquo;ve had times when I wrote in bursts, and I always told myself - Yeah, this is great. I should do more of it. It is not like I feel like a Yoda who knows too much and needs to write down to teach others, in fact, it is just the opposite. I\u0026rsquo;m always pulled in multiple directions to learn different things since there is so much to learn. The act of writing itself brings some kind of joy that is fulfilling to me.\nSome short periods of writing that I remember.\n 2000s  Of course, I wrote a lot of code during this time, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t count. During my initial days as software developer, I used to write on the side, not software or technical stuff but just random things that I wanted to be made as stories. Started blogging using ger. Started writing poetry, even made a book of poetry with my wife.   2010s  When I took up CS 200, the professor wanted us to write an article every week. That topic of focus at that time was Project Management. When I took up CS 297, the professor wanted us to write an article or prepare a ppt for the set of research papers we read that past week. Doing MS CS at SJSU was probably the best learning experience I had. Got opportunities to solidify a lot of concepts, comprehend technical material better, and write technical papers.    Writing (or anything for that matter) is easier when you\u0026rsquo;re doing it for someone. When someone is expecting an output from you, it is easy to sit down and meet the deadline. But there is more satisfaction in doing things that no one asked for, in doing things that you asked yourself. Makes you feel in control and not being controlled.\nSo, I committed to writing at least for 30 minutes per day. Regardless of whether it was good or not, the purpose was to build the habit. I was able to write long notes like The Return of the Native which is over 7000 words by just writing a bit each day as a I read. Was trying hard to follow the Seinfeld method1 and not break the chain. Luckily, github shows the chain beautifully and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to buy a calendar like what Seinfeld had suggested.\nWriting or reading is the hardest when you have a long list of things to be done and when you feel the need to have more than 24 hours in a day just to keep up with the unending list. It is easy to give advice to someone and tell them to prioritize when they are actually caught in a quicksand that is pulling them down. So, one actually needs to be fortunate to be a able set even 10 minutes towards something that one wants to do. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to have gotten the time.\n Jerry Seinfeld\u0026rsquo;s Productivity Secret. Seinfeld revealed a unique calendar system he uses to pressure himself to write every day. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works. He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker. He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. \u0026ldquo;After a few days you\u0026rsquo;ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You\u0026rsquo;ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t break the chain,\u0026quot; he said again for emphasis. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"","id":6,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Writing Habit","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-08-the-writing-habit/"},{"content":"Thoughts As I had mentioned in My Reading Journey, The Great Expectations was one of the first novels I read. I\u0026rsquo;ve read it so many times over the years, each time taking something away more than before.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m reading it after The Return of the Native and can\u0026rsquo;t help but compare the approaches of Hardy and Dickens. Both give us a glimpse of a period of time and a set of people that we become intimate with by reading. Through great dialogues, monologues, many times in the dialect of the locals, the readers get to know the emotional state of the protagonists at every juncture of their lives.\nIn this novel, we feel like Pip is narrating as he is living his life and not as a person who is recounting events from his past. The fear he feels with the convict, when he is harassed by the guests, when soldiers come to the door and he thinks they have come for him, his feelings for Estella, his feeling of hopelessness of being a blacksmith, and so on, everything is so well captured, that it is unbelievable.\nThough there is an element of fate interfering withe lives of people in both the novels, I think fate is much more harsher in Hardy\u0026rsquo;s novel than in Dickens. I think the overarching narrative is that people \u0026lsquo;reap what they sow\u0026rsquo; and usually get into difficult situations or fortunate ones depending on many of the decisions they make. Matthew Pocket, Herbert, Joe, Biddy are good throughout and they get rewarded in the end. Compeyson, Orlick, Pumblechook, Drummle, are not and they get punished. But, when I think of \u0026lsquo;The Return of the Native\u0026rsquo;, I think the narrative is that people don\u0026rsquo;t have a choice. They are just playthings in fate\u0026rsquo;s hands. Things will play out the way it needs to regardless of what people plan.\nNotes Stage I Chapter I - Pip meets the convict The novel starts with Pip, a boy standing near the graves of his parents and his dead brothers trying to imagine what they looked like. We get to know that he had named himself and Pip in his childhood and his actual name is Philip Pirip. He is brought up \u0026lsquo;by hand\u0026rsquo; by his sister and brother in law. Brother in law, Joe Gargery, is a blacksmith.\nPip is interrupted by a large, dirty man with prison irons attached to his leg. He demands to know Pip\u0026rsquo;s name, turns him upside down to empty his pockets, He tells Pip to bring him some food and a file after he gets to know that his uncle is a blacksmith. He tells him that there is a young man with him who will tear is heart and liver out if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t oblige. Pip runs home frightened.\nChapter II - Pip steals food for the convict Pip returns to his home. His sister, who is 20 years senior to him, scolds him and asks him where he has been. She reminds him that she brought him up by hand and that he is a burden to her. Her husband, Joe is a mild-mannered person. Mrs. Joe gives Pip and Joe bread and butter fo supper. Pip hides his in his trousers. Joe is surprised that Pip bolted the bread and Mrs. Joe is upset that he swallowed the whole thing. She gives him tar-water as punishment.\nThey discuss about the escaped convicts when they hear gunshots. They live near the coast, near the marshland, where ships that form as jails are docked.\nNext morning is Christmas day. Pip is not able to sleep in the night and early in the morning, he gets up, takes some more food from the pantry, some brandy and runs off to the marshes in search of the convict.\nChapter III - Pip gives food to the convict On his way, he sees man that he thinks is the convict, touches him and gets startled to know that the person is not the person as before. He thinks this is the young man the other man was talking about. The person runs away. Pip walks a bit more and finds the original convict and gives him food and the file. When Pip tells him about the other convict, this man is totally surprised. He gets to file away at the irons on his leg and ignores Pip. Pip slips away and runs towards home.\nChapter IV - Christmas Dinner Pip rushes home thinking that his theft might have been found out. But is relieved to know that everyone is busy in dinner preparations for Christmas. They have some guests - Uncle Pumblechook (Joe\u0026rsquo;s uncle), Mr. Wopsle (church clerk who has a voice better than the priest) and Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. During dinner Mrs. Joe and Uncle Pumblechook focus on Pip and tell him that he has to be grateful towards his sister. Joe tries to console Pip by pouring some gravy into his plate. Mr. Pumblechook drinks the brandy from the bottle and spits it out discovering that it was tar-water. Pip is frightened thinking that his stealth will get discovered. He is about to run out of the home, opens the door and sees cops outside.\nChapter V - Pip and Joe joins soldiers to search for convicts Pip is relieved when the soldiers say that they need the services of a blacksmith. So they did not arrive to catch him! The soldiers need help to repair handcuffs. Joe helps with it after that, when they set out to find the fugitives, Joe, Mr. Wopsle and pip join them. After a long search they find them. The two men are found fighting each other in a ditch. The convict tells the soldiers that he was capturing the other convict to bring him to the prison. The soldiers capture both men and take them to the station. Pip wonders if the convict would think that he led the soldiers to them. The convict tells the soldiers that he had stolen some food and file from the blacksmith\u0026rsquo;s home, thus clearing Pip\u0026rsquo;s name. Joe says it is ok.\nChapter VI - Pip and Joe get back home Pip and Joe get back and tell the folks what happened. Everyone wonders how the thief broke in and have multiple theories including him entering through the chimney. Pip does\u0026rsquo;t tell anyone, not even Joe.\nChapter VII - Pip gets the opportunity to offer services a rich lady Pip is not old enough to be apprenticed to Joe. So, he attends a school run by Mr. Wopsle\u0026rsquo;s great aunt. Mr. Wopsle is a tenant of one of the rooms in the building. The building also has a little general shop. The grand-aunt is helped by Biddy who is her grand-daughter. Pip comes home and tries to teach Joe what he has learnt. Joe is super impressed. When asked why Joe didn\u0026rsquo;t go to school, he talks about his childhood when his dad was a drunkard who beat up him and his mother. Since his mother was abused, he is very careful to note that he would never abuse his wife and is ok to take abuse from her.\nMrs. Joe makes occasional trips with Mr. Pumblechook on market days to assist him to buy household items since he was a bachelor and didn\u0026rsquo;t trust his servants. One of the days she returns with Mr. Pumblechook to inform Joe and Pip that a rich old lady, Ms. Havisham has asked for a boy and Mr. Pumblechook was gracious enough to suggest Pip. She is very happy and grateful to Mr. Pumblechook for the opportunity. Gets Pip cleaned up for the visit and leaves that night.\nChapter VIII - Pip visits Satis House Pip stays with Mr. Pumblechook that night and is taken to Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s mansion the next day. Pumblechook reminds him to be grateful for the opportunity to go into this great house. Though the house is big, it seems very old and not maintained. A gruff young lady greets them, lets only Pip in. While walking she mentions that the name of the house is Manor House or Satis House. She leaves him in a room which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have outside light coming in but has candles. Pip sees Ms. Havisham dressed in bridal clothes. They look grand but are old and yellow. She asks him to play and he is confused. She then asks him to call Estella. He calls her and they play cards. Estella beats him at the game and insults him for his looks and clothes throughout. He almost cries in front of Estella on the way back but holds back his tears. Pip is so embarrassed by himself that he kicks against a wall on the way back. He realizes that he is a low-life.\nChapter IX - Pip describes events at Satis house Pip returns home to find everyone very curious to know what happened. Mr. Pumblechook says that he has never seen Ms. Havisham but has had interactions with the house many times on business. Pip is uncomfortable since he is still sad about him being low in the social strata. He invents a story about Ms. Havisham sitting on a black velvet coach, Estella handing her cake and wine on a gold plate, and four large dogs fighting for veal cutlets from a silver basket. They are totally astonished.\nLater Pip tells Joe the truth and he admonishes Pip to not tell lies.\nChapter X - Pip gets money from the convict from the past Couple of days later Pip wakes up thinking - best step he could take towards making himself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew. So he goes over and learns from Biddy who is willing to help him with all that she knows. One day, his sister tells Pip to get Joe from a public house named Three Jolly Bargemen on his way back from school, since he goes there in the evenings to smoke. Pip goes there and a man offers them a drink. Joe refuses but the man insists. Pip notices that the man is stirring his drink with the file that Pip had stolen in the past. He gets a fright thinking that his secret would be out. The man gives Pip a shilling wrapped in paper which turns out to be pound notes. Joe goes back thinking it was a mistake but are not able to find the man. Pip has a nightmare about the file in his sleep.\nChapter XI - Pip goes to Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s again In the last meeting, Ms Havisham had told him to come after 6 days. The day comes and Pip makes a visit to the Manor House. Estella lets him in and takes him to a room where he sees some other people - 3 ladies and a man. A lady named Camilla, who reminded Pip of his sister, a man named Cousin Raymond, another lady named Sarah Pocket, another lady named Georgiana. They look at him and comment about him. He is then taken to another room where there is a wedding cake that is rotten and has insects crawling about them. Ms. Havisham holds Pip\u0026rsquo;s hand and goes around in the room. She says that when she dies, her body will be on the table with all the people watching.\nPip plays cards with Estella with Ms. Havisham watching. Estella continues to insult him. On his way back, a thin boy approaches him and challenges him for a fight. Pip knocks him down but he always gets up to fight. Finally he gives up. Estella who is waiting at the gate doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask him why he is late. She grants him a kiss. He kisses her but still feels like a downtrodden person.\nChapter XII - Pip\u0026rsquo;s appointment at Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s becomes daily Next time when he goes over to the Manor House, Pip is half expecting to be punished or scolded for beating up the thin boy. But he doesn\u0026rsquo;t find the boy anywhere nor is there any mention of him. He goes in and continues the regular thing of walking with Ms. Havisham in the room and playing with Estella. Sometimes the walk goes on for 3 hours. Ms. Havisham gets to know more about Pip, that he is set to be apprenticed to Joe when he grows older, etc. Pip is expected to go daily and that continues for many months.\nOne day, Ms. Havisham says Pip is old enough to be apprenticed and asks him to call Joe to the Manor House. He gets home and tells the news to Joe and Mrs. Joe. His sister is angry that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t invited and takes it out on Joe and Pip. She asks Joe why he didn\u0026rsquo;t marry a slave.\nChapter XIII - Pip\u0026rsquo;s apprenticeship to Joe is formalized The next day, Pip, Joe and his sister go over to the town. His sister goes to Mr. Pumblechook\u0026rsquo;s place and Pip and Joe head over to Satis House. Estella opens the gate as usual, doesn\u0026rsquo;t take any notice of them and leads them to Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s room. Ms. Havisham asks a few questions to them. Joe answers questions to Pip instead of to Ms. Havisham even for questions directed at him. It embarrasses Pip. Towards the end, Ms. Havisham gives a generous amount of 25 guineas and tells him to give it to his master, Joe.\nThey get back and tell Mrs. Joe and Mr. Pumblechook and they are very surprised at the amount given. As he goes back home, Pip realizes that the job that he once looked forward to, is not exciting anymore. He does not want to be a blacksmith.\nChapter XIV - Pip feels bad about being just a blacksmith Pip says that it is a miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. He once felt distinguished and happy merely at the thought of becoming Joe\u0026rsquo;s apprentice but not anymore. As he thinks back, he reminds himself of all the great qualities of Joe. The reason he did not run away or feel out of place, was not because he was virtuous, or faithful, it was because Joe was virtuous, Joe was faithful beyond measure.\nPip is haunted by the fear that Estella would come one day and see him with a black face and hands, dirtied by the job and consider him lower than she already thought and truly despise him.\nChapter XV - Mrs. Joe is attacked Pip continues to work for Joe. Since he has grown, his education at Mr. Wopsle\u0026rsquo;s great-aunt\u0026rsquo;s school is done. Biddy continues to teach him what she knows, Pip tries to learn things from Mr. Wopsle also. He tries to teach Joe what he knows it is not of much use.\nOne day, he asks Joe for half-day off to go to town and see Estella. Joe advises him against it telling him that Ms. Havisham might think that he has gone there to ask for something. Pip is insistent and Joe grants him his wish. Orlick, another chap who works with Joe also asks for half-day telling him that he should treat all employees equally. Joe relents. Mrs. Joe hears this and is totally furious. She asks Joe if he thinks he is so rich that he can afford to waste wages. Quarrel ensues between her and Orlick. Joe beats him up for talking bad to his wife.\nSunday comes and Pip goes to Satis House. Estella doesn\u0026rsquo;t open the gate, it is Sarah Pocket. Ms. Havisham tells him that Estella has gone away abroad to be educated to become a lady and is prettier than ever, hoping to taunt him.\nPip is in no mood to go home. But goes over slowly. On the way he hears some commotion, someone says there is something wrong at his place. He reaches home to find that someone has broken in and knocked down Mrs. Joe with a very hard blow on her head.\nChapter XVI - Mrs. Joe is paralyzed, Biddy comes to stay to take care of her They discover that the blow was made with the leg-iron that the convict had filed away long back. Mrs. Joe is completely bedridden and Joe and Pip take care of her with difficulty. Mrs. Joe cannot talk and does not know to write.\nLucky for them, Mr. Wopsle\u0026rsquo;s great-aunt passes away and Biddy comes to stay with them. She nurses Mrs. Joe and takes care of others.\nMrs. Joe often used to write the symbol of T which Joe or Pip never understood. Biddy surmises that it could mean a hammer. They realize that Mrs. Joe means to say Orlick. They bring in Orlick thinking that she will denounce him as the person who hit her but she is friendly with him and he comes by often after that.\nChapter XVII - Pip confides in Biddy of his desire to become a gentleman Pip goes to Satis Manor on his birthday to visit Ms. Havisham. She gives him a guinea and tells him to come next yr during his birthday. Pip becomes conscious of Biddy changing into a neat young lady, though not as beautiful as Estella. He asks Biddy how she manages to take care of the house and also catch up with him on all the reading and learning. She reminds him jokingly that she is his first teacher. Pip has heartfelt conversations with Biddy on how he feels. He tells her that he wishes he could be happy as a blacksmith and be with Joe and her but he is not, he wants to be a gentleman. When he tells her than it is on account of a young lady at Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s, Biddy asks if he wants to be a gentleman to spite her or to win her. She gives the sage advice that both reasons are not good enough and that the lady is not worth winning over. Pip tells her frankly that it would have been easier if he was in love with her than with Estella. Biddy doesn\u0026rsquo;t mind it and is thankful for his confidence. On the way back home, they meet Orlick and both hate to be with him. She says he has eyes on her and that\u0026rsquo;s why she doesn\u0026rsquo;t like him, but it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be of Pip\u0026rsquo;s concern. They get home. Pip\u0026rsquo;s dissatisfaction with life keep growing and he says that the confusion is fifty thousand fold and is scattering his wits.\nThis is probably the most poignant part of the story yet. One feels sad for Pip, sad for Biddy, and sad for being in a place of unhappiness.\n \u0026ldquo;Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?\u0026rdquo; Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\n  \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; I moodily answered.\n  \u0026ldquo;Because if it is to spite her,\u0026rdquo; Biddy pursued, \u0026ldquo;I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.\u0026quot;\n Chapter XVIII - An anonymous patron bestows wealth on Pip It is the fourth year of his apprenticeship with Joe and on one Saturday evening, while they were in Three Jolly Bargemen, a lawyer presents himself and asks for Pip. Pip and Joe go with him to Joe\u0026rsquo;s home, and Mr. Jaggers, the lawyer tells them that an anonymous patron wants to gift a property to Pip and fund his training to become a gentleman. At the beginning, Mr. Jaggers asks Joe if he wants money or some form of compensation for relieving Pip from his apprenticeship. Joe says no. Mr. Jaggers tells them that Pip will live in London and he can take training from anyone. Since he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know anyone, Jaggers suggests Mr. Mathew Pocket whom he has heard of. Pip quickly makes the connection to Ms. Havisham since he had heard the name there. Jaggers gives him money to buy clothes. Joe is dumbfounded. Jaggers again asks if Joe needs any money for the loss of Pip\u0026rsquo;s services and he says no. When Jaggers insists, Joe gets upset. Jaggers leaves. Pip decides that he will buy clothes but not wear them from the village, lest everyone see. He will wear them from Pumblechook\u0026rsquo;s home and go to London. Pip tells Biddy and she is happy with the news. Though Joe and Biddy are cheerful, Pip is gloomy at the prospect of leaving. But he is also looking forward to leaving.\nChapter XIX - Pip prepares to leave his village Pip prepares to leave to town to shop for clothes. He mentions to Joe that if he could read or \u0026lsquo;get on a little more\u0026rsquo; with the lessons, he could have come with him to London. Joe mentions that he is awfully dull and it is better for him here. Pip mentions the same to Biddy and she tells him that Joe might actually like it here in the village than in London. Pip thinks it is because of her jealousy. Biddy says he can think what he wants to. Pip goes over to the town. Pumblechook is totally a changed man to him now. He ingratiates himself to Pip by giving him the best food, shaking his hands many times and praises him often. Pip gets his new clothes and dresses himself up in those and goes over to Satis House. Sarah Pocket receives him at the gate and he gets to meet Ms. Havisham who already knows about his good fortune from Mr. Jaggers. Pip goes back to Pumblechook\u0026rsquo;s place, changes clothes and goes to his village. His packs up and bids good bye to Joe and Biddy, who bid him a tearful good-bye. When he reaches the finger-post at the end of the village, he is also overcome with emotion and sheds a tear. He goes on, towards town, taking a coach, changing coaches along the way and onward to London.\nStage II Chapter XX - Pip reaches London Pip gets to London. He is scared by the immensity of London and does not like the ugly, crooked, narrow and dirty roads. He goes to Mr. Jaggers\u0026rsquo;s office and finds out that he is in the court. He is asked to wait in the room. There are many others waiting for Jaggers. When Jaggers comes in he sees how others are scared of him. Jaggers tells him that he is to ramain with Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s son at Barnard\u0026rsquo;s Inn, until Monday and then go to Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s home. He was given generous allowance and cards of many tradesmen from whom he could make purchases.\nChapter XXI - Pip meets Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s son Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers\u0026rsquo; assistant, takes Pip over to Barnard\u0026rsquo;s Inn and Pip is not very impressed by the Inn from outside. Pip views it as an imperfect realization of one of his first great expectations. When they reach the room, they don\u0026rsquo;t find young Mr. Pocket there. Instead they find a note that says \u0026lsquo;Gone out, back shortly\u0026rsquo;. Wemmick goes away and Pip waits for the young man to come. He takes a bit of time but eventually comes. He says that he had gone out to the market to get some fruits for Pip. When they get to see each other, Pip realizes that the young boy is the same \u0026lsquo;pale young gentleman\u0026rsquo; that he had beaten up at Satis House, for which he got a kiss from Estella! Both are surprised.\nChapter XXII - Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s sad story Pip finds that Herbert, Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s son, is a very amiable person. He tells him that Estella was adopted by Ms. Havisham and that he didn\u0026rsquo;t care much for being betrothed to her. During dinner, Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s story. While eating, he also teaches Pip upper class manners whenever a chance comes. He gives Pip the name of Handel, after a famous composer.\nThis quote about Pip\u0026rsquo;s impression of Herbert, caught my eye -\n I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich.\n I stopped reading the book and thought about myself at that moment!\nMs. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s Story - Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s father was a country gentleman and also a brewer. After her mother died when she was young, her father denied her nothing and in his doting, he made her a spoit child. Her father married a servant in secret and had another child, Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s half brother. As the son grew, he turned out to be a rogue. The father disinherited him and he was out to take revenge. Ms. Havisham falls in love with a showy man who pretends to be a gentleman. But he stands her up during her wedding. It turns out that the man was friends with the half-brother and this was an act of revenge. Ms. Havisham is devastated. Time stops and she has been in her wedding dress with all the arrangements including the cake not being touched or removed after that.\nHerbert says that he works in a counting house who is planning to get into trading in the future. Pip makes a visit to Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s house after a few days. He finds Mrs. Pocket sitting at a place and reading not bothering about her children. Two maid servants take care of the kids. Mr. Pocket is a good man but is overwhelmed by having so many kids (7 kids).\nChapter XXIII - Pip meets Mr. Mathew Pocket Mr. Pocket is happy to see Pip and hopes that Pip also finds it good to be tutored by him.\nMrs. Pocket is the daughter of a knight and was brought up as a lady so that she could be an ornamental wife to a man of title. She ends up marrying Mr. Pocket against her dad\u0026rsquo;s wishes. She is unable to manage her household which is run by the servants. She resents being an incapable person and laments her fall from being nobility.\nMr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and Cambridge and had distinguished himself, but he ruined his prospects by marrying early and to the wrong person. He had to take up tutoring to maintain his family. He is sad about his lost chances and tries to get a break as a favor from one of the parents of the youth he tutors. Though they promise him something, after the education is done, they forget.\nMs. Coiler, a snoopy neighbor, tries to get close to Pip and tells him that Mrs. Pocket thinks it is humiliating that her husband has to tutor.\nChapter XXIV - Pip sees how Jaggers commands respect Pip takes a long walk with Mr. Pocket and gets advice on how to improve. He like Mr. Pocket.\nHe travels to and fro between his apartment at St. Barnard which he shares with Herbert and Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s home.\nHe goes to Jaggers and requests for money to buy furniture and Jaggers is generous and asks his clerk Wemmick to write a check. Wemmick introduces him to other clerks and also gives him a glimpse of what type of personality Jaggers is. He tells him about the two masks on Jaggers desk, that they were of two famous clients. He takes Pip to court to see Jaggers in action and Pip is very impressed at the respect and fear that Jaggers commands.\nChapter XXV - Pip visits Wemmick\u0026rsquo;s Castle Other students of Mr. Pocket are introduced. Bentley Drummle is a rich spoilt kid who is a blockhead. Startop is a kid who is spoilt by over affection from his mother.\nAfter a couple of months, Mr. Pocket is visited by the relatives of Ms. Havisham that Pip had met in the past. They are Mr and Mrs. Camilla and Georgiana. Camilla is Mr.Pocket\u0026rsquo;s sister. Georgiana is a cousin. They don\u0026rsquo;t have much regard for Mr.Pocket though.\nPip decides to visit Wemmick since he had invited him home. They walk to the home and get talking. Wemmick tells Pip that Jaggers never locks his door and challenges anyone to rob him.\nPip reaches the home and finds it to be a fancy one. Wemmick calls it \u0026lsquo;The Castle\u0026rsquo;. He designed, architected and built the home. It even has a drawbridge and canon (named Stinger). He has an elderly father who he calls \u0026lsquo;The Aged\u0026rsquo;. There is a little girl who takes care of the Aged. The dinner is excellent and Pip is very pleased.\nChapter XXVI - Pip and friends have dinner with Jaggers Jaggers invites Pip and his friends for dinner. Jaggers asks about Drummle, giving him a nickname of \u0026lsquo;The Spider\u0026rsquo;. He has an ability to read people and think what they would amount to. They have a good meal, served by the housekeeper.\nWhen the men have an argument about strength, Jaggers makes Molly, the housekeeper to show her wrists. They look at the disfigured palms and Jaggers tells them that this is is strongest pair of wrists that he has seen.\nWhen the conversations heat up, Jaggers dismisses them and the men go home.\nA few months later, Drummle leaves Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s home and everyone seems relieved.\nChapter XXVII - Joe visits Pip at Barnard\u0026rsquo;s Pip gets a letter from Biddy informing him that Joe is coming to London with Mr. Wopsle and he would like to visit him and if Pip is not available, he could leave a message.\nPip is not quite looking forward to the meeting since he is embarrassed by Joe. He is relieved that Joe was coming to Barnard\u0026rsquo;s Inn and not to Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s home) since he didn\u0026rsquo;t want Drummle to meet Joe and judge Pip that he has relatives of low status.\nPip has furnished his apartment very lavishly and even has a servant whom he calls The Avenger.\nJoe comes and it is evident that he is not very comfortable in the lavish settings. While they were talking Herbert comes in and is excited to see Joe and talks to him well. Joe tells them that he is in town to see Mr. Wopsle act in a play. Wopsle had left church and now was a full time actor.\nAfter Herbert is gone, Joe tells Pip that he is actually here as a messenger. Ms. Havisham had asked to see him and that Estella was in town. She had sent a word through Pumblechook. Biddy had told Joe that it might be better to inform Pip by word than by letter.\nJoe doesn\u0026rsquo;t stay for dinner and goes away.\nChapter XXVIII - Pip is on his way to visit Ms. Havisham Pip decides to make a visit to Satis House. He does a lot of thinking about what to do. Should he stay at Joe\u0026rsquo;s place? Should he take the Avenger? What if Trabb\u0026rsquo;s boy tells Avenger unsavory things about his childhood? etc. He decides to stay at the Blue Boar Inn and not to take the Avenger.\nPip finds that in the coach that he takes, two convicts are also being transported. He recognizes one person as the one who gave him two one pound notes. Pip tries his best to avoid the convicts and being recognized.\nThe convicts don\u0026rsquo;t have a place in the back so they are put in the front much to the dismay of other passengers.\nPip overhears the convicts talking and one of them says that another person had asked him to give two one pound notes to a boy who had fed him and kept his secret. He had done it, though his companion tells him that it was a foolish thing to do hinting that he should have just taken the money. He goes on to say that the other man got charged for escaping prison and got a life sentence.\nPip gets even more alarmed after hearing the conversation thinking that he convict might recognize him soon. So as soon as the town comes, he gets down and walks the rest of the way. At the Inn, the waiter recognizes him and asks if he should send for Mr. Pumblechook. Pip says no and the waiter puts a dirty old copy of a local newspaper where Pip finds Pumblechook mentioned as the founder of Pip\u0026rsquo;s fortunes.\nChapter XXIX - Pip\u0026rsquo;s meeting with Ms. Havisham and the lady Estella Pip wakes up early and goes for a walk and gets thinking, day-dreaming about Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s brilliant plans for him. He thinks that as she adopted Estella, she adopted him also and is planning to see them united. He also thinks that she has left the house is disrepair so that he could restore the house to its glory. He realizes that he loves Estella against reason, against promise, against all discouragement.\nLater in the morning, he goes to Satis House and is surprised to find Orlick opening the gate. He tells that he left the forge after Pip left and joined as a porter here. Pip goes along the corridor to meet Ms. Havisham and meets Sarah Pocket on the way. He tells her that Mr. Pocket and family are well.\nThere is a young lady by Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s side whom Pip doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognize. But when she lifts her eyes, he recognizes that it is Estella. She has returned from France and is to go to London to be introduced to society.\nLater, Pip and Estella walk around the property and Estella tells Pip that she had watched Pip and Herbert fight, in secret. Pip remembers the kiss that she granted him but she doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nEstella tells him that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t remember anything in the past with emotion because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a heart. She has never felt love.\nWhen they get back, they learn that Mr. Jaggers will be dining with them. During dinner, Pip notices that Mr. Jaggers doesn\u0026rsquo;t give much regard to Estella. He prods Mr. Jaggers about Estella\u0026rsquo;s past and whether she is Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s daughter or not. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t get much from Jaggers.\nAfter dinner Pip goes back to the Boar deciding to sleep there and head for London the next day, without paying a visit to Joe.\nChapter XXX - Pip is mocked by Trabb\u0026rsquo;s boy At the Blue Boar, Pip tells Mr. Jaggers that Orlick may not the right sort of person to work at Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s and tells him some of his past. Jaggers agrees to fire him right away. While Pip is afraid to deal with a person like Orlick, Jaggers seems to relish in that. Pip goes into town. He is proud in his gentlemanly clothes and people seem to respect him. He sees Trabb\u0026rsquo;s boy on the way and gets upset when he imitates and mocks him. As soon as he reaches London, Pip sends codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe as an apology for not visiting. In the next day\u0026rsquo;s post, he also writes a letter to Mr. Trabb saying that he will not do business with him due to the boy\u0026rsquo;s conduct.\nPip confesses to Herbert about his love for Estella which Herbert had already guessed. Herbert also mentions to him that since Mr. Jaggers never mentioned Estella, marrying her may not be a condition or wish from his benefactor who he thinks is probably Ms. Havisham. He also warns him that Estella will make him miserable considering the way she has been raised. Of course, Pip doesn\u0026rsquo;t heed the advice.\nHerbert also confides in Pip about him being engaged to a girl named Clara who he likes but is below his mother\u0026rsquo;s nonsensical family notions. Pip and Herbert go to see Mr. Wopsle\u0026rsquo;s play.\nChapter XXXI - Pip and Herbert go to Mr. Wopsle\u0026rsquo;s play The play doesn\u0026rsquo;t go well. Some actors are coughing, some have forgotten the lines, audience keep interrupting, etc. Pip and Herbert rush to go out in order to escape meeting Mr. Wopsle but they are stopped by a Jewish man who tells them that Mr. Waldengarver is expecting to see them. That turns out to be Mr. Wopsle. Pip and Herbert are polite to him and say that his acting was good. Pip invites him from supper. He is sad while going to bed and a miserable dream about this expectations being cancelled, he had to marry Herbert\u0026rsquo;s Clara or play Hamlet before thousands of people without knowing the words.\nChapter XXXII - Pip goes to receive Estella who is coming to London Pip receives a note from Estella via post which says that she is arriving in London by mid-day coach the day after. Pip arrives at the station 4-5 hours earlier than needed. He runs into Wemmick there who is on his way to Newgate prison to meet a client. He goes with him and is impressed by the way Wemmick is familiar with the prisoners. He gets back and fears if the the filth of the prison has rubbed off on him. Tries to dust himsself off and before long, the coach arrives with Estella in it.\nChapter XXXIII - Pip takes Estella to Richmond Estella and Pip get into a carriage to go to Richmond in Surrey which is around 10 miles. During the journey they talk and Pip\u0026rsquo;s naïveté comes across clearly when he speaks to Estella. She tells him that Ms. Havisham\u0026rsquo;s relatives write nasty letters about him, sometime anonymously to Ms. Havisham. Pip is surprised that they mean harm to him. Estella assures him that they will never succeed in their machinations against him. On the way they see Newgate prison and Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s place). Pip drops Estella to Richmond and then takes another carriage to get back to Hammersmith.\nChapter XXXIV - Pip and Herbert have mounting debt Pip learns that he is incurring a lot of debt due to his lifestyle. Same is the case with Herbert also. They incur more debt by joining a club named \u0026lsquo;Finches of the Grove\u0026rsquo; which encourages to spend more foolishly. Drummle is part of that club.\nPip and Herbert sit down to write their debts, creating sheets with the headings - \u0026ldquo;Memorandum of Pip\u0026rsquo;s debts\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Memorandum of Herbert\u0026rsquo;s debts\u0026rdquo;. It runs to many papers and they know that their debts are mounting.\nPip receives a letter from Trabb and Co. that his sister has passed away and his attendence was requested for the service.\nChapter XXXV - Pip goes to his sister\u0026rsquo;s funeral Pip goes to the forge and finds it to be decorated gaudily. Mr. Trabb and Co. had taken over the decorations though Joe didn\u0026rsquo;t want them saying that it would be disrespectful to Mrs. Joe.\nAfter the ceremony, Pip has dinner with Joe and Biddy. In the night Pip asks Biddy why she didn\u0026rsquo;t write to him about his sister\u0026rsquo;s condition. She calls him Mr. Pip and tells him that he didn\u0026rsquo;t keep in touch and she didn\u0026rsquo;t think that he wanted to know. She tells him that she is going to leave the forge and be a school teacher. But will continue to look out for Joe. Pip tells her that he will visit more often and Biddy is doubtful and Pip is hurt by her distrust. When he is going away the next day, Biddy apologizes.\nChapter XXXVI - Pip comes of age Pip and Herbert go from bad to worse in terms of debt. Luckily Pip turns 21 and is expecting money to come from his benefactor by at that time. He gets a note from Wemmick that Mr. Jaggers would like to meet him on that day. Thinking that he would also get to know the name of his benefactor, Pip goes over. Jaggers gives him 500 pounds and tells him that Pip will get an annual sum has to manage his money on his own now. He tells Pip that the benefactor will remain a secret.\nPip goes to Wemmick and tells him that he would like to spend the money on helping Herbert. Wemmick says his professional opinion that one should never invest portable property on a friend. He tell him that he can give his personal opinion at home.\nChapter XXXVII - Wemmick helps Pip to carry out his generosity Pip makes a visit to Wemmick\u0026rsquo;s Castle the next Sunday. He find the drawbridge drawn indicating that Wemmick is not home but he rings anyway. The Aged lets him in and says that Wemmick has gone for a walk. Wemmick comes back from the walk with Ms. Skiffins, a lady he is courting. Pip and Wemmick take a walk and Pip tells Wemmick about his desire to help Herbert without him knowing. Wemmick tells him that he can arrange things through Ms. Skiffins\u0026rsquo;s brother who is an accountant. Later, Wemmick carries out Pip\u0026rsquo;s plan. Herbert gets a call from Clarriker and Co. with an offer and he is ecstatic. Pip is happy that he was responsible for Herbert\u0026rsquo;s joy.\nChapter XXXVIII - Estella and Ms. Havisham have an argument Pip visits Estella often at Richmond where she is staying with a lady named Mrs. Brandley and her daughter. They were people of good position and were visited by many folks. Estella has many suitors but Pip thinks she behaves familiar with him to make the other suitors jealous. Estella warns him not to be attracted to her but Pip doesn\u0026rsquo;t heed. She tells him that Ms. Havisham has asked to meet and he should take her to Satis House. They go to the house after a couple of days and see Ms. Havisham. She boasts to Pip about the many suitors that Estella has and Pip thinks that she is using Estella just to see men have heartbreaks.\nLater that day Pip sees Ms. Havisham and Estella having a big argument. Ms. Havisham calls her an Ingrate. She accuses her of being cold hearted. Estella replies back saying that she was brought up like that and she can only give what she received. She says that she has never been unfaithful to her schooling and that she has never shown her weakness.\nAfter a few days, at the Finches club meeting, Drummle mentions Estella\u0026rsquo;s name and Pip is upset. When he visits Richmond, he sees the attention that Estella is paying to Drummule and confronts her and says that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t like it. Estella says that all she does is to entrap and deceive men, except Pip.\nThe chapter ends by Pip saying that a dramatic turn of event comes to his life much like the roof falling on his head.\nChapter XXXIX - The convict reveals the truth about Pip\u0026rsquo;s patron Couple of years pass by. Pip is twenty three. Pip \u0026amp; Herbert had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year, and lived in the Temple, in Garden-court, down by the river Thames. He has parted with Mr. Pocket also and he maintained good relationship with him.\nOne night, when Herbert was away on Business to Marseilles, Pip receives a mysterious visitor who asks for him. After he comes in, Pip realizes that he is the convict that Pip had saved many years ago. The convict calls him \u0026lsquo;noble Pip\u0026rsquo;. He reveals to Pip that he is the patron and Pip is stunned. The convict goes on to tell him how hard he worked to make Pip a gentleman and that he is very proud now. He also tells him that he has come to London illegally with the sole purpose of seeing Pip, to see the fruit of his labor of making someone a gentleman.\nPip is devastated by the news. He thinks of Estella and is sad that since Ms. Havisham was not the benefactor, there was never an indirect plan of Ms. Havisham keeping Estella for him.\nStage III Chapter XL - Pip confirms the convict\u0026rsquo;s claim with Jaggers In the morning Pip realizes that keeping the convict hidden would not be easy at all. The Avenger was not in his service anymore. He had an old lady as maid and her niece. Asking them to not go to a room would arouse suspicion. So he decides to tell them that the convict is his uncle. It is still early morning and is dark. When he goes out, he stumbles against someone on the stairs. Pip chats with the watchman at the gate and finds out that when Pip\u0026rsquo;s uncle came in in the night, there was another man who had followed him.\nPip comes back to his quarters and finds that the convict has woken up. He comes out of his room and Pip doesn\u0026rsquo;t like his shabby looks. Pip tells him that he\u0026rsquo;s told others that he is his uncle and the convict is pleased. He said he has taken the name of Provis while here. Pip asks if he was followed yesterday to which Provis replies he didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\nDuring breakfast, Pip notices that Provis ate in a ravenous way and his manners were uncouth. Pip is very uneasy and does not like the man at all. Provis tosses a pocket-book bursting with money and tells Pip that all he has is Pip\u0026rsquo;s and he would like Pip to spend it on luxuries. He says he would be proud to show off Pip to all the people in the past who looked down upon him. Pip is even more worried and asks for his plans. The convict says he intends to stay there as Provis and it should not be a problem.\nPip goes over to Mr. Jaggers and asks him. Jaggers confirms that the convict, whose actual name is Abel Magwitch is the real benefactor. He still refers to Magwitch and Provis and two different people. Magwitch being in Australia and Provis being another person who is representing him in London. Pip buys Provis some new clothes. Herbert arrives back from his trip and is introduced to Provis who swears him to secrecy about him.\nChapter XLI - Pip tells Herbert about his actual benefactor Pip tells Herbert about the convict being his benefactor and that he is there illegally and wants to go by the name of Provis and live a life of luxury. Pip and Herbert agree that the best course of action is to somehow get the man out of England and try to explain to him that he is in danger if he remains in London. Pip also decides to stop accepting any more money from Provis though he is deep in debt. Since he has not been trained for any trade, he feels like he is good for nothing and being a soldier is his only option. Herbert tells him that he could always work at Clarriker. The decide to ask Provis about his past.\nChapter XLII - Provis recounts his past to Pip and Herbert During the next day breakfast, Provis tells them about his past. He grew up as an orphan on the streets, surviving by stealing small things or begging. He does not even know how he got the name Abel Magwitch. Around 20 years back, at Epsom races, he met a gentleman by the name of Compeyson. A person whom he would kill right now if he met him, he is the person who Magwitch was fighting with on the ditch as a convict many years back. Compeyson befriends Magwitch and tells him to be his partner. Magwitch finds that Compeyson is not the gentleman he looks like, his business is actually swindling, handwriting forging, stolen-bank notes, etc. There was another man named Arthur who was living with Compeyson in his home upstairs. Arthur was sick and was tended to by Compeyson\u0026rsquo;s wife out of pity. Arthur has hallucinations of a broken-hearted woman who was going to come for him. He and Compeyson had swindled a rich woman of lot of money in the past. Arthur dies after some time due to his sickness and hallucinations. Compeyson and Magwitch go about swindling and forgery, with Magwitch doing all the work and Compeyson underpaying him. They eventually get caught but the judge passes harsher sentence on Magwitch by his looks and lighter one on Compeyson thinking that he was a gentleman who was influenced badly by Magwitch.\nDuring the imprisonment, Magwitch escapes and he gets to know from Pip that Compeyson had also escaped. So he fights with Compeyson and makes sure to put him in jail though it costs him his freedom.\nHerbert passes Pip a note telling him that \u0026ldquo;Young Havisham’s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham’s lover.\u0026rdquo;\nWell, instead of reading slowly and writing daily notes, I went ahead and finished the book.

What I realize is that I got the gist of the story but had missed out on a lot of details that Hardy provides. Nevertheless, I had become a fan of Hardy and ended up reading almost all of his books other than Jude the Obscure. The Mayor of Casterbridge remains my favorite since it kind of resembled a Bollywood movie when I read it.\nHardy was not just a writer who wrote a story. He was a history buff, a traveler, an expert in birds and plants, a biblical scholar, and more importantly, a philosopher who understood human nature very well. I felt that he put in all his knowledge into the book in order to teach, and the story was just a small part of it.\nThere are a lot of references to Greek mythology throughout the novel. References to Artemis, Athena, Prometheus, Scylla and Charybdis, Zeus, Olympus, Tantalus, Ulysses, Aeneas, etc. pop up in many places. Reading these references took me back to a time when I read \u0026lsquo;Purana Kathasagarangal\u0026rsquo; a book of stories from Greek mythology.\nAlso, a lot of biblical references are found throughout. Different quotes and references from the Gospels, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Book of Samuel, Judges, etc. are found in different places. Was surprised by references like - comparison of watchman recognizing Ahimaaz\u0026rsquo;s gait from afar to Mrs. Yeobright recognizing Clym\u0026rsquo;s gait, Nebuchadnezzar\u0026rsquo;s dreams to that of Eustacia\u0026rsquo;s, destruction of Sennacherib\u0026rsquo;s army, and so on.\nHe refers to history of UK (Guy Fawkes, Mary Queen of Scots) , USA (Virginia, War of Independence), Greece (Alexander the Great), India (there is a reference to Begum and Warren Hastings), and so on.\nDetailed descriptions of birds, places, plants, sometimes using botanical names, references to Darwin, are astounding.\nAlso, there are so many philosophical insights about human nature that it is remarkable and thought provoking. For instance, he says that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity, that a well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer. It made me sit and think. Viewing someone as exceptional or godly is bad for the viewer and the person!\nOverall, it is a great read to understand many things. Though most people would read the book during their college days, I think it is best enjoyed after you have experienced many facets of human life - childhood, adolescence, marriage, children, jobs, after you have read enough history or seen enough movies/documentaries about different cultures in the world.\nNotes BOOK ONE THE THREE WOMEN 1 - A Face on Which Time Makes but Little Impression Meaning of the title = Egdon heath is the face which has not changed over time.\nThe whole of the first chapter is an intriguing introduction to the landscape that the events in the novel are based on. It is a description of Egdon heath as a powerful force of nature, as nature itself. One can almost visualize the twilight as though one is right there. About the twilight he says, it is the time of the day where when a worker looks up, he might continue to work but when he looks down or around, he might feel like it is getting darker and is time to wind up. Hardy calls the heath as a wasteland that is vast and lonely. It has brown vegetation. But he goes on to say that is has been there since prehistoric times and has been unaltered as the stars above though everything around has changed over time. He contrasts it with the sea that is renewed frequently - \u0026lsquo;distilled by the Sun and kneaded by the moon\u0026rsquo;! The sea changed, the fields changed, the rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained. He gives an imposing persona to the heath.\n2 - Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble Meaning of the title = Reddleman appears with a woman (trouble) on his carriage. An old man who meets them on the way gets to know that there is a woman in the carriage and probably adds to the trouble.\nA old man with a walking stick, wearing an ancient boat-cloak (cloak worn by naval officers) is seen walking alone. He sees a van far away and catches up to it. It was that of a reddleman, a person who sells reddles to the villages. Reddles are red seeds that are used to mark sheep when they are sold in fairs. The trade makes the person who sells red since the pigment spreads on clothes and skin during handling.\nThe reddleman is not much of a talker but since he keeps going to the back of the van to check upon something, the old man inquires and is told that there is a lady. The old man tries to extract more information but cannot. They part ways when the reddleman says that his ponies need to rest.\nIt is getting darker and the reddleman looks towards the horizon and sees a woman near the barrow on top of the mountain. After a short while, she goes away and more people come in.\n3 - The Custom of the Country Meaning of the title = Custom of the Country is to light a bonfire on the 5th of Nov.\nThis is a long chapter and there is a good amount of dialogue in it. After the first two chapters ended with no characters being named, here many are introduced.\nThe group that gathered around are children, men and women of the neighboring hamlets and they\u0026rsquo;ve come to light bonfires. Across the heath, you can see bonfires at different places and they\u0026rsquo;re doing it to celebrate some custom. Hardy says people have been lighting bonfires since ancient times of the Druids. Even if the reasons change, the custom remains.\n To light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man when, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded throughout Nature. It indicates a spontaneous, Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat that this recurrent season shall bring foul times, cold darkness, misery and death. Black chaos comes, and the fettered gods of the earth say, Let there be light.\n The people around the bonfire include Grandfer Cantle, his son Christian, Timothy Fairway, Humphrey, Sam, Susan Nunsuch, Olly Dowden. Grandfer is quite a jolly person who sings songs and dances. Christian is just over 30 yrs and says that no woman would marry him. The folks are quite superstitious and they say that he lacks virility since there was no moon when he was born. They also say that single sleepers are visited by ghosts.\nThey talk about the marriage of Thomasin Yeobright and Wildeve that was to happen earlier that day. They mean to go to Wildeve\u0026rsquo;s inn and sing a song later. The marriage was opposed by Thomasin\u0026rsquo;s aunt openly in the church and later she had agreed. They also mention that Mrs. Yeobright\u0026rsquo;s son Clym is soon returning and they seem to have an admiration for him. They look at a bonfire a bit faraway that is burning steadily and mention that it might be due to wood being used. They mention that it might be by Eustacia, Captain Vye\u0026rsquo;s granddaughter. They don\u0026rsquo;t speak favorably of her.\nThey dance as the fire dies out, Christian gets frightened when reddleman appears who has come towards them asking the way to Mrs. Yeobright\u0026rsquo;s house. A few minutes after the reddleman leaves, Mrs.Yeobright comes. She takes Olly and goes towards Wildeve\u0026rsquo;s Inn, The Quite Woman.\n Persons with any weight of character carry, like planets, their atmospheres along with them in their orbits.\n 4 - The Halt on the Turnpike Road Meaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright halts to talk to Diggory Venn and finds out the bad news.\nMrs. Yeobright and Olly walk down the hill and when they reach the road Olly goes towards her home and as Mrs. Yeobright is about to enter the Inn, she sees a horse and a van nearby and the reddlemen walking alongside. She goes and talks to him to find out that her neice is no in Wildeve\u0026rsquo;s Inn but in the carriage, that she did not get married earlier in the day as expected. Thomasin gets down from the carriage, Mrs. Yeobright and she walk toward the Inn to confront Wildeve.\n5 - Perplexity among Honest People Meaning of the title = Probably indicates the surprise in the village folk who came to dance and found Thomasin inside and not outside with Wildeve\nShe says that if he promised to marry her, he must do it, otherwise, it would bring great shame to the family. Wildeve explains that it couldn\u0026rsquo;t happen because of an issue with licence. They had gone to Anglebury to register the marriage but since it was made out for Budmouth, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t useful in Anglebury. Thomasin tries to defend Wildeve. She says that she was upset and decided to come back by herself and not with Wildeve and that it was not his mistake. Wildeve promises that the marriage will happen in a couple of days.\nIn the mean time, the earlier group of people come to celebrate the wedding. Wildeve asks the Yeobrights to stay in the room while he goes to entertain. He gives them drinks and chats with them. They leave and when he comes back, he finds the Yeobrights to have already left by the open window at the back.\nHe looks outside and sees one bonfire still being lit and knows that it is a sign for him. He goes towards it.\n6 - The Figure against the Sky Meaning of the title = Figure against the sky that reddleman saw was Eustacia\nIn the chapter we learn that the old man who had spoken to reddlemen was Eustacia\u0026rsquo;s grandfather. He had put one-and-one together and informed Eustacia that probably the marriage didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. She lights the fire to signal Wildeve to come to her thinking that he called of the wedding in the last minute because of her.\nShe has asked Johnny Nunsuch, a boy in the neighborhood to tend to the bonfire and goes once in a while to the barrow to check on Wildeve\u0026rsquo;s Inn through a telescope and then comes back. She asks the boy if he heard a frog jump on the lake to which he replies no. Her grandfather asks her to come indoors and she says she will. After a while, the boy tells her that he heard a frog jump. She sends him off with a sixpence and we see Wildeve coming over after the boy leaves. He tells her that she does not give him peace with the lighted bonfire that does not die out. She tells that she is upset that he chose Thomasin over her. But that she is glad that he didn\u0026rsquo;t marry due to his love for her. Wildeve explains that it was no the case and it was due to a licence issue. But they continue to chat about their love for each other. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow him to kiss her though. He leaves and she goes to sleep.\n7 - Queen of Night Meaning of the title = Description of Eustacia as a Queen\nThis chapter is a detailed character sketch of Eustacia. She is described as exceptionally beautiful. Her father was a bandmaster in the navy and was lucky to have married the captain\u0026rsquo;s daughter. Her grandfather was not quite happy about it since he was from a noble family. Other aristocratic roots, comparisons to greek gods are also made. She is also portrayed as a very passionate person who has highly romantic notions in her head.\n Fidelity in love for fidelity\u0026rsquo;s sake had less attraction for her than for most women; fidelity because of love\u0026rsquo;s grip had much. A blaze of love, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same which should last long years.\n Though she grew up in Budmouth, she is now at Edgon heath with her grandfather after he dad passed away. She hates being here and is always in expectation of something grand to happen.\n To dwell on a heath without studying its meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue. The subtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia; she only caught its vapours. An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet, a suffering woman a devotee, a pious woman a psalmist, even a giddy woman thoughtful, made a rebellious woman saturnine.\n 8 - Those Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody Meaning of the title = The boy Johnny finds Wildeve and Eustacia together and later stumbles upon Diggory Venn.\nThe boy Johnny Nunsuch is going towards his home happy with the money he got from Eustacia. On the way he gets frightened with something and decides to go back and ask Eustacia to lend a servant to walk back with him. But once he reaches there he finds Eustacia talking to Wildeve and he is caught in what Hardy calls as \u0026lsquo;Scyllaeo-Charybdean\u0026rsquo; position (after rock and a whirlpool in greek mythology). He decides to not disturb them, musters courage and goes towards his home.\nOn the way back, he gets frightened of something and slips and falls near Diggory Venn. Venn asks him some questions and finds out about Wildeve meeting with Eustacia.\n9 - Love Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy Meaning of the title = Diggory Venn hatches a plan to eavesdrop on Wildeve and Eustacia.\nHardy explains that women used to scare their children by saying \u0026lsquo;the reddleman is coming for you\u0026rsquo;. He says that ordinary people don\u0026rsquo;t take up the trade though it is vanishing. Reddlemen are wanderers like gypsies but they look down upon gypsies. Sometimes people take up the reddle trade as a penance after some wrongdoing.\nVenn returns to his van and takes up an old letter to read. It is a letter from Thomasin where she explain why she couldn\u0026rsquo;t marry him. She does see him that way. Looks like the spurned marriage offer is what made Venn to leave his father\u0026rsquo;s dairy farming and go into reddle trade. He still cares for Thomasin and is upset and Eustacia and Wildeve are causing pain to her.\nSince the boy had told him that Eustacia and Wildeve had agreed to meet on the Rainbarrow, Venn goes there daily to see if they are. The first three days pass by withouth incident. The fourth day, he sees them meet. He hides in a nearby bush and manages to overhear the conversation. Wildeve wants Eustacia to go away to America but she does not say yes or no. They depart.\nVenn goes back to his van and decides to have a word with Eustacia.\n10 - A Desperate Attempt at Persuasion Meaning of the title = Diggory Venn tries to persuade Eustacia\nVenn goes to Mistover Knap first thing the next morning. He sees the grandfather at the entrance who offers him a drink. Venn says he is there to meet Ms. Vye. Since it is too early, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to meet in spite of waiting for some time. So he goes outside and waits while walking around. She comes after some time. He broaches the subject of Wildeve and Thomasin but she doesn\u0026rsquo;t take the hint. He then comes in the open an accuses her of the person who is holding the marriage by controlling Wildeve. He asks her to release Wildeve. She is shocked. But refuses by saying \u0026ldquo;he was mine before he was hers! He came back because he liked me best!\u0026rdquo;. Since he knows that she hates the heath, he even offers her employment in Budmouth through a reference from his uncle. But she still refuses.\n11 - The Dishonesty of an Honest Woman Meaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright tells Wildeve that she is going to give Thomasin to another suitor though she had said no to Diggory.\nAs Venn is walking back towards his van, he sees Mrs. Yeobright walking towards the Quiet Women to meet Wildeve. He goes over and talks to her. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell her why he thinks Wildeve may not marry Thomasin since he knows that Eustacia has him fully charmed. He proposes his hand in marriage. But Mrs. Yeobright doesn\u0026rsquo;t agree since Thomasin hadn\u0026rsquo;t agreed two years ago.\nWith this new information, Mrs. Yeobright goes into the Inn and talks to Wildeve. In order to force his hand, she says that Thomasin has another suitor who is ready to marry her. Wildeve is surprised. Contrary to what Mrs. Yeobright expected, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t commit.\nLater that evening, he goes to meet Eustacia and tells her that their path is clear since Thomasin has another suitor and that she is not interested in him anymore. Eustacia is shocked by this and almost immediately loses interest in him. \u0026ldquo;What was the man worth whom a woman inferior to herself did not value?\u0026rdquo;, she says to herself. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t commit and tells him that she will give a final answer on Monday at 8 by the Rainbarrrow.\nLater that night, her grandfather returns and tells her that Mrs. Yeobright\u0026rsquo;s son Clym Yeobright is coming home to spend Christmas with his mother. He is coming back from Paris where he had spent the last decade.\nBOOK TWO THE ARRIVAL 1 - Tidings of the Comer Meaning of the title = Eustacia overhears news of Clym who is about to come to Egdon.\nOne day, late in the afternoon around 3 PM, Eustacia is standing in the kitchen near the chimney and she could hear men talking outside. The men would be Sam and Humphrey, the furze cutters, who are stacking up the furze, closely watched by Captain Vye. They\u0026rsquo;re talking about Clym as they do their work. They\u0026rsquo;re proud of him and hold him in high esteem. He is said to be working for a diamond merchant in Paris. After the captain leaves, they talk among themselves, saying that if there was anyone who was a match for Clym it was Eustacia.\nEustacia spends the whole afternoon daydreaming about Clym. Later in the evening, she decides to go and have a look at Yeobrights\u0026rsquo; home.\n2 - The People at Blooms-End Make Ready Meaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright and Thomasin are getting ready for Clym\u0026rsquo;s arrival.\nMrs. Yeobright and Thomasin has busy preparing for Clym\u0026rsquo;s arrival, Thomasin is on the attic to gather apples. Both are talking as they do their work. After that, they go out to gather berries. Thomasin tells her aunt to not mention the marriage with Wildeve to Clym. Mrs. Yeobright again points out that Wildeve is not the saint that her niece thought to be. She also tells her about her dialogue with Wildeve where she mentioned about another suitor.\n3 - How a Little Sound Produced a Great Dream Meaning of the title = A little hello from Clym in the darkness sends Eustacia\u0026rsquo;s imagination wild.\nEustacia is near Blooms-End but does not see any motion or light there. As she is going back, she sees 2 women and a man coming on the way. As they reach nearer, she knows that the women and Mrs. Yeobright and her neice. The man says \u0026ldquo;Good Night\u0026rdquo;. Since it is darks, she is not able to hear him.\nShe thinks of the voice the whole night and has vivid dreams in the night. For the next few nights, she walks around the heath to catch a glimpse of him by some chance encounter but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen.\n4 - Eustacia Is Led on to an Adventure Meaning of the title = Eustacia dresses up as a Turkish knight to have a glimpse at Clym\nEustacia\u0026rsquo;s grandfather gives permission to the mummers to come and practice in his fuelhouse. Eustacia watches them practicing and comes to know that they are going to perform at Blooms-End on Monday night. She sees this as a great opportunity to see Clym since she was afraid that he might go away after Christmas. She influences Charley to take a break on the day when they\u0026rsquo;re going to play at Blooms-End and let her play the part diguising as someone else, instead. In exchange he gets to kiss her hand.\nCharley is one of the Egdon mummers for the present year, and he and the other mummers practice in Captain Vye\u0026rsquo;s house for the play \u0026ldquo;Saint George.\u0026rdquo; On the night they are to perform in Mrs. Yeobright\u0026rsquo;s house, Eustacia arranges to take Charley\u0026rsquo;s place in order to see Clym and study him in the guise of the Turkish Knight. Some of the boys recognize her.\n5 - Through the Moonlight Meaning of the title = The title is probably a nod to the band of mummers walking through the moonlight to Blooms-End to perform.\nMonday evening comes and as decided, Eustacia joins the mummers in disguise, goes over to Yeobrights\u0026rsquo; home and plays the part.\n6 - The Two Stand Face to Face Meaning of the title = Eustacia and Clym meet face to face.\nEustacia rests after the play an surveys the room to look for Clym. She gets her chance to see him. When she sees him talking to Thomasin, she regrets having come in disguise thinking that in her natural form she could have charmed him. Mrs. Yeobright asks the mummers to stay for dinner and they\u0026rsquo;re happy. The mummers were not in a hurry to leave. So she goes outside to wait for them while watching the moon. Clym comes by and asks her if she were a women disguised as Turkish knight. She says yes but doesn\u0026rsquo;t reveal who she is. Having accomplished what she came to do, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t wait for others and goes home.\nWhile returning, Eustacia remembers that it is Monday night and she had an appointment with Wildeve to let him know her decision. But since the time has passed and she is no longer interested in him, she is now indifferent.\n7 - A Coalition between Beauty and Oddness Meaning of the title = Venn and Eustacia partner up to make Wildeve marry Thomasin.\nVenn meets with Eustacia and tells her that he saw Wildeve waiting at the Rainbarrow for a long time previous night. He is sure that Wildeve will go again tonight and tells her that he can take a letter to him if needed. Eustacia writes a letter saying that she is no more interested in Wildeve. Venn delivers the letter and Wildeve decides to marry Thomasin to make Eustacia suffer. The next day, Wildeve goes to Blooms-End and asks Thomasin. She accepts in order to protect the pride of her family.\n8 - Firmness Is Discovered in a Gentle Heart Meaning of the title = Thomasin, the gentle heart is firm this time on marrying Wildeve, before Clym is back, also not to have Mrs. Yeobright at the wedding so as to not embarass her.\nThomasin goes ahead with marriage. When Clym returns Mrs. Yeobright tells him the story. He feels sad and wants to attend the wedding. While he is on his way, he sees Diggory Venn who tells him that it is over. The person who gave the bride away was Eustacia Vye. This is the first time Clym hears about Eustacia.\nBOOK THREE THE FASCINATION 1 - \u0026ldquo;My Mind to Me a Kingdom Is\u0026rdquo; Meaning of the title = Refers to Clym saying that his mind would be put to better use as a schoolteacher than as a clerk in a diamond shop.\nClym Yeobright was famous in the neighborhood from his childhood. He was a bright kid, people were in awe of him and began to always expect great things from him. Hardy mentions a quote by a Jesuit here -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;It is bad when your fame outruns your means.\u0026rdquo;. Probably, the hype around him was greater than he could match. So, when he went to Paris to work, the expectation grew even higher.\nSo, when he says, during haircutting at Fairways, that he is leaving behind his excellent job in Paris and staying back at Egdon to start a school, people are surprised. They commend his good-heartedness but feel that he would learn things in a few weeks.\n2 - The New Course Causes Disappointment Meaning of the title = Clym\u0026rsquo;s mother is disappointed at his decision to leave behind a well paying job.\nHardy mentions that over-idealism and zealousness are not characters of a well-balanced mind.\n A well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer.\n He goes on to say that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity.\nClym\u0026rsquo;s mother is shocked by his decision and tells him that everyone thinks of going forward in life and his decision is definitely a step backward. While they are discussing, Christian Cantle comes in and says that Susan Nunsuch had pricked Eustacia Vye in the church to verify if she were a witch. Eustacia had fainted. Clym\u0026rsquo;s curiosity is aroused and he wants to know more about Eustacia. He puts one and one together and wonders if Eustacia had come to his house disguised as a Turkish knight the other day.

Since she says there is no water other than the one in the pool which is dirty, he decides to use a pail to get some water from the well, asks her to hold one end of the rope but in the process, Eustacia gets injured when the rope drags off her palm and takes the skin off. They talk and he tells her of his desire to become a schoolteacher and thinks that she would be a good help since she is an educated woman.

It is sad to know that she got to know from outside and not from her own son. Mrs. Yeobright doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a good opinion of Eustacia or her family and doesn\u0026rsquo;t think that is a right match.

Thomasin comes over and tries to console Mrs. Yeobright but she is not able to get her out of sadness. Thomasin says that she might need money since Wildeve doesn\u0026rsquo;t give her anything. Mrs. Yeobright says that she has money left by her uncle to be dived between her and Clym. She will give it later when she comes by.\nWildeve learns of Eustacia\u0026rsquo;s wedding to Clym and is surprised. He now feels like he made a mistake in marrying Thomasin and should have gone for Eustacia.\n7 - The Morning and the Evening of a Day Meaning of the title = Two major events happen - one in the morning (Clym\u0026rsquo;s wedding), another in the evening (Christian losing Mrs. Yeobright\u0026rsquo;s money through gambling)\nClym gets married. Thomasin attends but Mrs. Yeobright does not. Wildeve comes over to pickup a package that Thomasin said Mrs. Yeobright would give. Mrs. Yeobright wanted to give money to Thomasin and Clym as a surprise. Since it is money, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t give it to Wildeve. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t know that it is money but feels bad for the lack of trust.\nMrs. Yeobright gives the money to Christian Cantle asking him to give one half to Thomasin and another to Clym as wedding gift. On the way, Christian stops at Wildeve\u0026rsquo;s Inn and does some gambling. He wins and likes the game. During the course he reveals that he needs to go to Mistover to give a gift to Thomasin. Wildeve is intrigued. He says he will walk with him. On the way, Christian reveals that he is carrying money for Thomasin. Wildeve asks Christian to play a game of dice. He wins over the money and sends Christian empty handed.\n8 - A New Force Disturbs the Current Meaning of the title = Reference to Diggory Venn interceding and winning the money back.\nVenn was watching the whole scene from the shadows and saw how Wildeve cheated Christian out of the money.

Eustacia is still hopeful that he will decide to return to Paris. In the meantime, Mrs. Yeobright would be wondering why Clym never sent a thank you note for the money. Thomasin had sent it couple of days after receiving it. Mrs. Yeobright questions Christian and gets to know that he didn\u0026rsquo;t do what he was asked off and had lost all the money to Wildeve.\nMrs. Yeobright thinks that may be Wildeve gave it to Thomasin and Eustacia. When Eustacia visits her grandfather\u0026rsquo;s house, Mrs. Yeobright goes over and asks her about it.

She says she wants to go to the village festival and have a good time. Clym tells her to go since he is not much interested. She dresses herself and goes. An acquaintance who was supposed to be there is not there and she is left alone. She looks at people who are dancing and feels sad that there is no one to dance with. She decides to go back home and surprisingly, Wildeve comes by. They dance and she is happy. He escorts her back and on the way they see Venn and Clym walking together towards them. Wildeve takes another way thinking that they may be misunderstood. Venn spots him before he leaves.\nVenn goes over to the Inn and tells Thomasin that he saw Wildeve with a horse earlier. Thomasin asks Wildeve in the night where he had gone. He says he went to the town to buy a horse but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it. She then says that Venn saw him with a horse. He denies it.\n4 - Rough Coercion Is Employed Meaning of the title = Venn fires on Wildeve with a gun to scare him.\nWildeve is seen loitering around Clym\u0026rsquo;s house to get a glimpse of Eustacia in the nights. He walks over, sees the home and then goes back. One day, he decides to signal Eustacia using a moth. He does it and she knows it is him and she gets frightened. Then they hear a knock on their door. When Clym answers it, there is no one. Venn was spying on Wildeve all along. Wildeve realizes this and goes away. He hears a couple of gun shots next to him and gets scared. He thinks that Venn is going to shoot him to death that night.\nVenn goes over to Blooms-End and tells Mrs. Yeobright of Clym\u0026rsquo;s condition, asks her to reconcile herself with her son and daughter-in-law. In the meantime, Clym tells Eustacia that they need to get back in touch with his mother.\nThe chapter ends with Clym saying that his return from Paris has affected the lives of 3 people.

He picks her up and carries her to a hut almost a mile near to Blooms-End. He goes to get help. The neighbors come and they find out that she had been bitten by an adder. Since it would take some time for the doctor to come, they use an old remedy of killing live adders and using fat from those.\n8 - Eustacia Hears of Good Fortune, and Beholds Evil Meaning of the title = Eustacia hears of Wildeve\u0026rsquo;s good fortune, looks at Mrs. Yeobright\u0026rsquo;s death from far (beholds evil/fate taking control of their lives with Mrs. Yeobright\u0026rsquo;s death)\nWhile Clym is taking care of his dying mother, Eustacia\u0026rsquo;s grandfather arrives at Alderworth on his way to East Egdon and tells her that Wildeve has inherited 11 thousand pounds. He chides her for not sticking with him when she had him. Eustacia thinks of Wildeve after her grandfather leaves and admires him for not putting her down earlier that day by mentioning his becoming rich.\nShe sets out to Blooms-End to meet Clym and his mother. On the way she meets Wildeve. They come upon the hut where people have placed Mrs. Yeobright and are tending to her. Doctor pronounces her dead. To add to the troubles, the boy Johnny says that he was with Mrs. Yeobright earlier and she had cried out in her tiredness that she was a broken-hearted woman cast off by her son.\nEustacia is shocked and saddened by this and blames herself. They part ways and Eustacia goes home.\nBOOK FIVE THE DISCOVERY 1 - “Wherefore Is Light Given to Him That Is in Misery” Meaning of the title = This a quote from the book of Job when he is crying out to God in his misery. Why is light given to someone in misery? and life to those who have a bitter soul?\nClym goes into deep depression for many weeks after his mother\u0026rsquo;s death, blaming himself for the tragedy. Neither Eustacia or Thomasin\u0026rsquo;s words calm him down. He still thinks that his mother was wandering around and never came to see him. But Eustacia knows the truth but is afraid to tell him. When Wildeve visits with Thomasin, he tells her to wait till Clym gets better and tells her to not tell Clym about him being in the house on that day.\n2 - A Lurid Light Breaks in upon a Darkened Understanding Meaning of the title = The mystery surrounding his mother\u0026rsquo;s death is revealed to Clym\nOne day when Clym was standing in his garden, Christian Cantle comes there to tell him that Thomasin has given birth. While talking to him, he gets to know that his mother had planned to visit him and had spoken to Diggory before that. Clym later talks to Diggory and finds out that his mother had no ill feeling towards him. He goes over to Susuan Nunsuch\u0026rsquo;s home and talks to Johnny.

Wildeve thinks that it is a signal for him and he comes. Eustacia tells him that she did not do it. Wildeve offers her help and she says she wants to get away from there and go to Budmouth and may be to Paris.\n6 - Thomasin Argues with Her Cousin, and He Writes a Letter Meaning of the title = Thomasin urges her cousin to reconcile with Eustacia\nClym moves to Blooms-End hoping to hear from Eustacia. He goes over to the Inn and finds Thomasin. Thomasin urges him to go to Eustacia or write a letter to her and reconcile.\nWhen Wildeve returns in the night Thomasin questions him. He is surprised. But now, Thomasin has some doubts.\n7 - The Night of the Sixth of November Meaning of the title = The night on which Eustacia is hoping to flee\nClym sends the letter but when it reaches Mistover, her grandfather finds Eustacia to be already asleep. Eustacia sleeps early in anticipation of fleeing that night. She gives a signal to Wildeve around 8 hoping to meet him at midnight. The agreement was for him to take her to Budmouth. He had hinted that he was open to helping her, also willing to flee with her if she was ok. When Eustacia is ready to go in the night, it rains heavily. Around the time that she is waiting for Wildeve, Susan Nunsuch creates a wax doll of Eustacia\u0026amp;quots likeness, sticks it with pins and puts it into the fireplace, muttering incantations while it is being burnt.\n8 - Rain, Darkness, and Anxious Wanderers Meaning of the title = It is raining, Eustacia is waiting in despair. Others, Clym, Wildeve, Venn, Thomasin are anxiously searching\nEustacia is waiting at Rainbarrow in spite of the rain.

He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.\u0026rdquo; ~ Ronald Reagan\n\u0026ldquo;A leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.\u0026rdquo; ~ Lao Tzu\nThere are a lot of books on leadership. Even if you read a couple of them repeatedly, the leadership ideal in your mind gets renewed. However media or popular literature of a period portrays it, over the course of human history, leadership has always been about altruism. About someone deciding to take responsibility for someone other than themselves, someone deciding to step up and be the \u0026lsquo;shepherd that gives his life to the lamb\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll expand on this thought later. The focus of this post is to list some outstanding books that could be helpful in general.\nWhile reading The Goal I happened to land on a website named TOC Institute which had a detailed summary of the Goal. It mentions that ​The Goal is one of three books that Jeff Bezos requires his top management team to read. The 3 books are -\n  The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker\n  The Innovator\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma by Clayton Christensen\n  The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement by Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Jeff Cox\n  I\u0026rsquo;ve read 1 \u0026amp; 3 and am yet to read #2. I\u0026rsquo;d definitely recommend 1 \u0026amp; 3 to anyone. Over the last decade, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the opportunity to groom engineers to become tech leads, architects and first-time engineering managers . Teaching and coaching are my core strengths and I think if I get to do more of it, I\u0026rsquo;d definitely have more of a sense of fulfillment. For the managers, two books that I\u0026rsquo;ve always recommended are Management by Drucker and Good to Great by Jim Collins. In fact, the revised edition of Management has an awesome foreword by Jim Collins. My top 3 books would be the following -\n  Management : Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices by Peter Drucker\n  Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don\u0026rsquo;t  by Jim Collins\n  How to Become CEO: The Rules for Rising to the Top of Any Organization by Jeffrey Fox\n  As I mentioned earlier, there are many more great books and a few more come to my mind at this time. Couple of years back, one of my team leads suggested The Manager\u0026rsquo;s Path and I found it to be an excellent read, especially for folks in management in tech companies. Two other books by Jim Collins that I found to be super inspirational were - Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck\u0026ndash;Why Some Thrive Despite Them All and Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies. I listened to the audiobook version of these books during my runs in the past, and they were special because Jim Collins himself narrates them in his very persuasive and inspiring voice. Other books that come to mind are The 5 Levels of Leadership - Proven Steps to Maximize Your Potential by John C. Maxwell, Start with Why by Simon Sinek, and Multipliers - How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter by Liz Wiseman.\n","description":"","id":9,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Leadership - Essential Books","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-03-reading-list-leadership/"},{"content":"Was listening to the awesome title sequence of His Dark Materials again today. It is one of those pieces of music that keep replaying in your mind even after you stop listening to it. I love listening to Intro sequence themes and there are some iconic ones among American TV shows. For a long time, Fringe and Arrow themes were my favorite and I used to play them on youtube whenever I wanted to relax, close my eyes and just listen to music. A few years back, I happened to see the title sequence of The Expanse on Youtube and I was like, I must see this series. It was only available on Syfy that time and when it came on Prime, I was super happy. I think that a great opening sequence is critical to the success of a show. Cannot imagine Game of Thrones without its legendary title sequence.\nSo, here is a list of title sequences of shows that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen and think are great.\nTop 5 His Dark Materials   Game of Thrones   The Expanse   Fringe (Opening Credits all 7 seasons)   Daredevil   Other Great Ones The Man in the High Castle   The Arrow   Yellowstone   Poldark   12 Monkeys   Banshee   Westworld   Battlestar Galactica   Outlander   The X-files   Silicon Valley (Season 4)   Downton Abbey   True Detective (Season 1)   Versailles   ","description":"","id":10,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Favorite TV Title Sequence Themes","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-02-favorite-tv-intro-themes/"},{"content":"As a person who loves checking off items in \u0026lsquo;to-do\u0026rsquo; lists and checklists, I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked books that have a list of rules/principles. Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.\nSoftware Development, like other engineering disciplines, is fulfilling when executed within the frameworks of principles laid out by experts in the past. Choice of wrong architecture, wrong coding practices, even wrong names, give a lot of grief to people who have to debug production issues or maintain the systems. Many times, it is much simpler to rewrite the entire application than do patches on top of badly written software. While dealing with production issues is when one always wishes that people were better informed on basic principles and thought through things. DRY (Don\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself), SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) and KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid) are principles that everyone should live by. The best practical guide to Software Development is surely Code Complete 2 by Steve McConnell.\nBooks with Lists Anyway, the top books with lists that I\u0026rsquo;d recommend are\n Effective Java by Joshua Bloch 201 Principles of Software Development by Alan M. Davis Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley 55 Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering by Robert L. Glass Design Patterns by GoF  201 principles may have many principles that are dated, but many more are super relevant today. We\u0026rsquo;re now in the \u0026lsquo;no-code\u0026rsquo; development age where a lot of user-facing applications get created by dragging and dropping widgets from a UI. Also a lot of boilerplate code is written by the machine. So, one would hope that the actual code itself is modularized, clean and easier to find troublesome spots. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll enter into a phase where people cannot write bad code. Like Java took away the memory management headache from simple-to-medium applications forever. One had to still think of garbage collection and JVM tuning for applications that handled millions of requests. But most people don\u0026rsquo;t operate in the \u0026lsquo;league of big wigs\u0026rsquo; at all. (Haha, was about to say \u0026lsquo;league of big boys\u0026rsquo;!)\nA couple of years back, I\u0026rsquo;d asked DB, a senior executive that I respect a lot, to recommend a book based on his vast experience. He suggested reading any book by Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob). Yup, his books are great. Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Clean Coder are excellent reads and good reference materials.\nUber List Here is my uber list that I hope to revisit to update\n Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, 2nd Edition by Martin Fowler Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, 2nd Edition by Steve McConnell Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering by Frederick P. Brooks Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition by Jon Bentley The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 2nd Edition by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides Regular Expressions Cookbook 2nd Edition by Jan Goyvaerts, Steven Levithan CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold  I would have added the famous The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth but I haven\u0026rsquo;t read the series myself. Bill Gates himself mentioned this as an essential reading for programmers and it does figure in all the lists of great books on software development.\nThough I mentioned Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS above, the book is great as a reference and not for reading through fully in a short span of time. I\u0026rsquo;d really recommend Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou \u0026amp; Vazirani or Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian \u0026amp; Tom Griffiths or Tim Roughgarden\u0026rsquo;s Algorithm course on Coursera. Robert Sedgewick\u0026rsquo;s Algorithms is great if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for code in Java. One of my Graduate projects was in Rabin-Karp hashing algorithm and I relied entirely on the substring search section of the book. Sections 5.3 (substring search) and 5.5 (compression) are an excellent read for anyone who is new to those concepts. The fact that I remember the sections and can visualize the black and red text on the pages, itself is a testament to the book.\nI put Working Effectively with Legacy Code as #1 because that is what most software engineers do. I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in huge re-engineering efforts of legacy code to new stack multiple times. There are many excellent books that have essays with inputs from multiple experts. Best Software Writing by Joel Spolsky and Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming by Peter Seibel, come to mind.\n","description":"","id":11,"section":"tech-notes","tags":null,"title":"Software Development - Essential Books","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/tech-notes/2020-07-01-reading-list-software-dev/"},{"content":"Thoughts If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a sweeping introduction to all the various products under the Google Cloud umbrella, this is definitely the one you need to go through. The spectrum of offerings and the span that they cover amazed me. I had the knowledge of a few things - like GCE, App Engine, etc. but surely walked away with a lot more knowledge.\nMy favorite sections were the labs and the sessions around Storage Options. Storage is an area that I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved working on. Initially, I was intrigued as to why there were so many solutions - Cloud Storage, BigTable, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datastore, and then as I got to know more, they made sense. There was a neat table comparing and contrasting the features and use-cases. The labs were well organized, easy to do, and taught the concepts well. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t do the videos and just do the quizzes and the labs, it\u0026rsquo;s still worth the time. The other cool thing about the course was the availability of slides for each of the modules. They were excellent. Most of the Coursera courses don\u0026rsquo;t give slides (which is unfortunate), so it was great to see the slides. They were of high quality and very useful.\nAlso, the presentation and the pro-GCP argument, is quite compelling. Anyone who goes through the material would be convinced that there is no other offering in the world that matches the scale of Google. (Talk about Steve Jobs\u0026rsquo; Reality distortion field).\nNotes The Key Concepts at the beginning of every module is from Coursera and the notes are some bullet points that I took down after going through each section.\nModule 1 - Introducing Google Cloud Platform Key Concepts  Explain the advantages of Google Cloud Platform.

Compare Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).  Welcome to GCP Fundamentals  Brian Rice from the Google Cloud training team GCP offers four main kinds of services: compute, storage, big data and machine learning.The course focuses mostly on the first two, together with the topic of networking.  What is cloud computing?  NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) definition - Cloud computing is a way of using I.T. that has these 5 equally important traits -  Customers get computing resources on-demand and self-service. Customers access these resources over the net from anywhere they want. The provider of those resources has a big pool of them and allocates them to customers out of that pool. The resources are elastic. The customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go.   Ref -https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-definition-cloud-computing  How did we get here?  First Wave - Physical/Colocated - Instead of building costly capital intensive data centers, companies could rent space in shared facilities. (While at ebay, I remember visiting one of the data centers and seeing one section of the building that had hardware dedicated to the company.) Second Wave - Virtualized Third Wave - Serverless - Containerization and automated services.  Every company is a data company  In future, every company will become a data company, differentiating from their competitors in terms of great software centered on data.  GCP computing architectures  IaaS - Provides raw compute, storage, and network similar to the ways in which you handle physical machines. e.g. GCE, EC2. Once you get a GCE instance, you can install OS, and needed libraries, deploy applications after that. PaaS - Provides platform that you can deploy your application on. i.e, provides OS, middleware and the runtime. All that you need to do is to deploy your application. E.g. App Engine, Heroku. SaaS - Provides software in the cloud. E.g. G Suite, Dropbox, Workday.  The Google network  Google\u0026rsquo;s network carries as much as 40 percent of the world\u0026rsquo;s Internet traffic every day. The network interconnects at more than 90 Internet exchanges and more than 100 PoP worldwide.  GCP regions and zones  Regions are independent geographic areas. Locations within regions tend to have round-trip network latencies of under 5 milliseconds on the 95th percentile. A zone is a deployment area within a region. GCP\u0026rsquo;s services and resources can be multi-regional, regional, or zonal. App Engine, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage, BigQuery are examples of multi-regional deployments. As of 2019, Google Cloud Platform has 17 active regions, with more to come.  Environmental responsibility  All existing data centers use roughly two percent of the world\u0026rsquo;s electricity. Google\u0026rsquo;s data centers were the first to achieve ISO 14001 certification. Google\u0026rsquo;s data center in Hamina, Finland, has a cooling system that uses seawater from the bay of Finland to reduce energy use. Google is one of the world\u0026rsquo;s largest corporate purchasers of wind and solar energy. Google has been a hundred percent carbon neutral since 2007.  Google offers customer-friendly pricing  Google was the first major Cloud provider to deliver per second billing (!) for IaaS. Many of the best-known GCP services are billed by the second, including GCE and GKE. GCE has automatically applied sustained discounts. i.e., if you run and instance for over 25% in a month, discounts are applied for additional minutes.  Open APIs  GCP services are compatible with open source products. Cloud Bigtable uses the interface of the open source database Apache Hbase. Cloud Dataproc offers the open source big data environment Hadoop, as a managed service. TensorFlow is an open source software library for machine learning. Kubernetes gives customers the ability to mix and match microservices running across different clouds. Google Stackdriver lets customers monitor workload across multiple cloud providers.  This is classic Google. Truly altruistic. So many freebees and open standards. One could argue that no company in the world has done so much to lift the average person out of ignorance. All the free things have unlocked many unknown areas of the human potential.\nWhy choose Google Cloud Platform  Variety of solutions - computing, storage, big data, machine learning and application services. Global, cost-effective, open source friendly, designed for security.  Multi-layered security approach  Since Google has around 10 services each with over a billion users, you can be sure that security is one of key foundations and is ensured at every letter from bottom up. Hardware: Both the server boards and the networking equipment are custom-designed. Google also designs custom chips, including a hardware security chip. Secure boot stack:Cryptographic signatures over the BIOS, bootloader, kernel, and base operating system image, ensure that the right software stack is booted up. Premises security: Google designs and builds its own data centers, with multiple layers of physical security protections and limited access. The physical security measures also ensured on third-party data centers. Inter-service communication is encrypted: The infrastructure provides cryptographic privacy and integrity for remote procedure call (“RPC”) data on the network.\nIdentity Service: The central identity service goes beyond asking just for username \u0026amp; password. It intelligently challenges users for additional information based on risk factors. Users can enable 2FA including devices based on the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) open standard. Encryption at rest:Encryption (using centrally managed keys) is applied at the storage services layer. Also has hardware encryption support in hard drives and SSDs. Secure Frond end: GFE ensures that all TLS connections are terminated using correct certificates and following best practices such as supporting perfect forward secrecy. Additionally has protection against DoS. DoS protection: Has multi-tier, multi-layer DoS protections that further reduce the risk of any DoS impact on a service running behind a GFE. Intrusion detection: Rules and machine intelligence give operational security engineers warnings of possible incidents. Reducing insider risk: Google aggressively limits and actively monitors the activities of user with elevated access. Employee U2F use: To guard against phishing attacks against Google employees, employee accounts require use of U2F-compatible Security Keys. Software development practices: Google employs central source control and requires two-party review of new code. Google also provides its developers libraries that prevent them from introducing certain classes of security bugs. Ref:https://cloud.google.com/security/infrastructure/design  Budgets and Billing  GCP provides four tools to make sure that a customer doesn\u0026rsquo;t accidentally run up a huge bill. -budgets and alerts, billing export, reports and quotas. Budges \u0026amp; Alerts - You can define budgets per billing account or per GCP project. Budget limits and alerts can be configured. Billing export - lets you store detailed billing information in places where it\u0026rsquo;s easy to retrieve for more detailed analysis like BigQuery dataset. Reports - Visual tool in the GCP console that allows you to monitor your expenditure. Quotas - There are two types of quotas: rate quotas and allocation quotas. They are designed to prevent the over-consumption of resources, whether because of error or malicious attack.  Module 2 Getting Started with Google Cloud Platform Key Concepts  Identify the purpose of projects, folders, and organization nodes on Google Cloud Platform Describe the purpose of and use cases for Identity and Access Management List the methods of interacting with Google Cloud Platform Build a solution deployment using Cloud Launcher.  Module introduction  Projects are the main way you organize the resources you use in GCP Customers use Google Cloud Identity, and Access Management, also called IM, or IAM to control who can do what Different levels of security responsibility : On-prem - everything from physical security to application security is handled by the customer. As you go from IaaS to PaaS to Managed services, the amount handled by cloud provider increases.  The Google Cloud Platform resource hierarchy  Resource hierarchy - At the top level is organization node. It can have list of folders which can also have folders. Folders can have projects. Projects have all the resources (VMs, storage buckets, tables, etc.). Policies are inherited downwards in the hierarchy. Projects are the basis for enabling and using GCP services. Managing APIs, billing, etc. happen at the project level. The Cloud Resource Manager provides methods that you can use to programmatically manage your projects in Google Cloud Platform. E.g. Get list of projects, create new, update, delete, etc. Project attributes  Project ID - Globally unique, Chosen by you, Immutable Project name - Need not be unique, Chosen by you, Mutable Project number - Globally unique, Assigned by GCP, Immutable    Identity and Access Management (IAM)  You can assign policies to resources at a level of granularity you choose. Folders offer flexible identity management. Usually policies are assigned at folder level and the projects and resources inherit the policies. To use folders, you need an organization node at the top of the hierarchy.  IAM roles  Organization Policy Administrator - Broad control over all cloud resources. Project creator - fine-grained control over the project resources. Organization node would already exist if you\u0026rsquo;re a G Suite customer, if not, you can use Google Cloud Identity to create one. The policies implemented at a higher level in this hierarchy can’t take away access that’s granted at lower level IAM defines - \u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Can do what\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;On which resources\u0026rdquo;  \u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rdquo; - 4 types of principals -  Google account (test@gmail.com) or Cloud Identity user (test@example.com) Service account (test@project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com) Google group (test@googlegroups.com) Cloud Identity or G Suite domain (example.com)   \u0026ldquo;Can do what\u0026rdquo; - a defined role that has a list of permissions  e.g. InstanceAdmin - create, delete, start, stop and change an instance.   \u0026ldquo;On which resource\u0026rdquo;  Assign role on a specific element of the resource hierarchy - GCE instance instance_a.     3 types of IAM roles - Primitive, Pre-defined, Custom  Primitive roles are broad. You apply them to a GCP project, and they affect all resources in that project. They offer fixed, coarse-grained levels of access. E.g. Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles. Predefined roles apply to a particular GCP service in a project. They offer more fine-grained permissions on particular services. E.g. Compute Engine’s instanceAdmin role. Custom roles let you define a precise set of permissions   Service accounts -  Provide an identity for carrying out server-to-server interactions in a project Used to authenticate from one service to another    Interacting with Google Cloud Platform  You can interact with GCP using different kinds of user credentials  Gmail accounts or Google Group G Suite user accounts and groups Cloud Identity domain users and groups   For option #3, if you already have users are groups defined in an LDAP system (say MS AD), Google Cloud Directory Sync can be used for one-way sync There are 4 ways to interact with GCP  Cloud Platform Console - Web user interface  Developer tools - Cloud Repositories (git), Cloud Shell   Cloud Shell and Cloud SDK - Command-line interface  CLI tools - gcloud, gsutil (Cloud Storage), bq (BigQuery), Available as docker image, available via cloud shell   Cloud Console Mobile App - For iOS and Android  mobile app allows you to start, stop, and SSH into Compute Engine instances, and to see logs from each instance.   REST-based API - For custom applications  API explorer provides list of APIs. There are also client libraries to make the integration easier.      Cloud Marketplace (formerly Cloud Launcher)  Lets you quickly deploy functional software packages that run on Google Cloud Platform Packages offered by Google or third-pary  Module 3 - Virtual Machines in the Cloud Key Concepts  Identify the purpose of and use cases for Google Compute Engine Summarize the various Google Cloud Platform networking and operational tools and services Build a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console. Build a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.  Module Introduction  Compute Engine lets you run virtual machines on Google\u0026rsquo;s global infrastructure. In the module, we look at how GCE works and also focus on virtual networking  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network  VPC networks connect your Google Cloud Platform resources to each other and to the internet. You can segment your networks, use firewall rules to restrict access to instances, and create static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations. VPC networks are global, subnets are regional. Subnets can span the zones that make up a region.  Compute Engine  Compute Engine lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure. You configure a virtual machine much like you build out a physical server. You can create a virtual machine instance by using the Google Cloud Platform Console or the gcloud command-line tool. Features -  Per-second billing, sustained use discounts, committed use discounts Preemptible instances - you\u0026rsquo;ve given Compute Engine permission to terminate it if its resources are needed elsewhere High throughput to storage at no extra cost Custom machine types: Only pay for the hardware you need   Scale up or scale out. In 2018, the maximum number of virtual CPUs in a VM was 96, and the maximum memory size was in beta at 624.  Important VPC capabilities  VPCs have routing tables similar to physical networks. These are used to forward traffic from one instance to another instance within the same network, even across subnetworks and even between GCP zones, without requiring an external IP address. VPCs’ routing tables are built in; VPCs give you a global distributed firewall you can control to restrict access to instances, both incoming and outgoing traffic. VPCs can talk to each other either through shared VPC or VPC peering. Cloud Load Balancing  fully distributed, software-defined, managed service for all your traffic. With Cloud Load Balancing, a single anycast IP front-ends all your backend instances in regions around the world. It provides cross-region load balancing, including automatic multi-region failover, which gently moves traffic in fractions if backends become unhealthy.   VPC offers a suite of cloud balancing options -  Global HTTP(S) - Layer 7 load balancing based on load, Can route different URLs to different back ends Global SSL Proxy - Layer 4 load balancing of non-HTTPS SSL traffic based on load, Supported on specific port numbers Global TCP Proxy - Layer 4 load balancing of non-SSL TCP traffic, Supported on specific port numbers Regional - Load balancing of any traffic (TCP, UDP), Supported on any port number Regional internal - Load balancing of traffic inside a VPC, Use for the internal tiers of multi-tier applications   DNS  Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8) is a DNS service offered to Internet users worldwide by Google. Google Cloud DNS, is a DNS hosting service, a managed DNS service running on the same infrastructure as Google. Cloud DNS is also programmable. You can publish and manage millions of DNS zones and records using the GCP Console, the command-line interface, or the API.   CDN  Cloud CDN - Uses Google\u0026rsquo;s globally distributed edge caches to cache content close to users. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve set up HTTP(S) Load Balancing, simply enable Cloud CDN with a single checkbox.   Interconnect Options  VPN - Secure multi-Gbps connection over VPN tunnels Direct Peering - Private connection between you and Google for your hybrid cloud workloads Carrier Peering - Connection through the largest partner network of service providers Dedicated Interconnect - Connect N X 10G transport circuits for private cloud traffic to Google Cloud at Google POPs Partner Interconnect - Connectivity between your on-premises network and your VPC network through a supported service provider    Module 4 - Storage in the Cloud Key Concepts  Summarize the purpose of and use cases for: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, and Cloud Bigtable Choose between the various storage options on Google Cloud Platform Build a BigQuery table using data from Cloud Storage. Use SQL queries to analyze data stored in BigQuery.  Introduction to Google Cloud Platform Storage Options  Different applications and workloads required different storage database solutions. This module reviews the main storage options in GCP: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Data Store and Google Big Table.  Cloud Storage  Cloud Storage is binary large-object storage Object storage - you say to your storage, \u0026ldquo;Here, keep this arbitrary sequence of bytes\u0026rdquo; and the storage lets you address it with a unique key. In Google Cloud Storage, these unique keys are in the form of URLs, which means object storage interacts well with web technologies. Encrypts your data on the server side, Data traveling between a customer\u0026rsquo;s device and Google is encrypted by default using HTTPS/TLS It can be accessed as a File System via third-party tools such as Cloud Storage FUSE. Offline Media Import/Export - A third-party solution that allows you to load data into Google Cloud Storage by sending your physical media (HDDs, tapes, etc.) to a third-party service provider who uploads data on your behalf. Online Import - Cloud Storage Transfer Service enables you to import large amounts of online data into Google Cloud Storage quickly and cost-effectively. Cloud Storage files are organized into buckets.  Bucket attributes -\u0026gt; Globally unique name, Storage class, Geo Location, IAM policies or ACLs (can be overridden for objects), Object versioning setting (store past versions), Object lifecycle management rules (delete after 90 days).   Four different types of storage classes: Regional, Multi-regional, Nearline and Coldline.  Regional - Accessed frequently in a specific region. Multi-regional - geo-redundant. Most frequently accesses across a broader geo location. Nearline - Accessed less than once a month. Low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data. Coldline - Accessed less than once a year. Very-low-cost, highly durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.    Cloud Storage interactions  There are several ways to bring data into Cloud Storage  Online transfer - Self-managed copies using command-line tools (gsutil) or drag-and-drop Storage Transfer Service - Scheduled, managed batch transfers Transfer Appliance - rackable, high-capacity storage server that you lease from Google Cloud. You simply connect it to your network, load it with data, and then ship it to an upload facility where the data is uploaded to Cloud Storage.   Other ways to getting data into Cloud Storage  BigQuery \u0026amp; Cloud SQL - Import export tables App Engine - Logs, Cloud Datastore backups, images. Compute Engine - instance startup scripts, CE images.    Google Cloud Bigtable  Cloud Bigtable - Google\u0026rsquo;s NoSQL big data database service. Powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail. Ideal for applications that need very high throughput and scalability for non-structured key/value data, where each value is typically no larger than 10 MB. Cloud Bigtable is offered through the same open source API as HBase, the native Hadoop database. This enables portability of applications between HBase and Bigtable Attributes - Replicated storage, Data encryption in-flight and at rest, Role-based ACLs Choose Bigtable if data is Big (\u0026gt;1TB), Fast (rapidly changing, time series), NoSQL (not tied to a schema) Access Patterns  API - Read and write through data service layer like HBase REST Server, or a Java Server using the HBase client. Streaming - Data can also be streamed in through a variety of popular stream processing frameworks like Cloud Dataflow Streaming, Spark Streaming, and Storm. Batch Processing - Data can also be read from and written to Cloud Bigtable through batch processes like Hadoop MapReduce, Dataflow, or Spark.    Google Cloud SQL and Google Cloud Spanner  Cloud SQL - Managed RDBMS  Automatic replication - Replication from Cloud SQL master instance, external master instance, external MySQL instance Managed backups - retains up to 7 backups for each instance, which is included in the cost of your instance Vertical scaling (read and write) - Easily scale up to 64 processor cores and more than 100 GB of RAM. Horizontal scaling (read) - Quickly scale out with read replicas. Security - data encrypted at rest   Accessible by other GCP services and even external services.  App Engine - Access using standard drivers. Compute Engine - Access Cloud SQL instances using an external IP address. External services - Access using standard drivers like Connector/J for Java or MySQLdb for Python.   Cloud Spanner - Horizontally scalable managed RDBMS  Strong global consistency, including strongly consistent secondary indexes High availability through synchronous and built-in data replication. Suitable for DB sizes exceeding 2 TB and 10s of thousands of R/W per second.    Google Cloud Datastore  Horizontally scalable NoSQL DB Supports ACID transactions Schema less Access through RESTful interface High availability of reads \u0026amp; writes  Comparing Storage Options  Cloud Storage -  Blob store, No transactions, No complex queries, Capacity PB+, per unit 5TB/object. Use case - structured and unstructured binary or object data, like images, large media files and backups.   BigTable -  NoSQL wide column, transaction for single row, No complex queries, Capacity in PB+, 10MB per cell, 100 MB per row. Use case - analytical data with heavy read and write events, like AdTech, financial or IoT data.   Cloud SQL -  Relational SQL for OLTP, supports transactions, complex queries, Capacity upto 10 TB, per row size determined by DB engine. Use case - web frameworks and existing applications, like storing user credentials and customer orders.   Cloud Spanner -  Relational SQL for OLTP, supports transactions, complex queries, Capacity in PB, 10GB per row Large-scale database applications that are larger than 2 TB. For example, for financial trading and e-commerce use cases.   Cloud Datastore -  No SQL document store, supports transactions, no complex queries, capacity in TB, 1 MB per entity. Use case - Semi-structured application data that is used in App Engine applications.    Module 5 - Containers in the Cloud Key Concepts  Define the concept of a container and identify uses for containers Identify the purpose of and use cases for Google Container Engine and Kubernetes Build a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine. Deploy and manage Docker containers in Kubernetes Engine using the kubectl command.  Containers, Kubernetes, and Kubernetes Engine  Comparison Overview -  Compute Engine, IaaS offering, with access to servers, file systems, and networking. App Engine, PaaS offering, with access to preset runtimes, managed services. Kubernetes Engine is a hybrid which conceptually sits between the two and benefits from both.   Why Container ?  Compute Engine - the smallest unit of compute is a VM, where you can configure anything from runtime, disk I/O, networking, web server, DB, etc. As the demand increases, you have to copy an entire VM and boot the guest OS for each instance of your app, which can be slow and costly. App Engine - packages everything including services and dependent libraries, scales automatically. But does not have the flexibility of compute engine. Container - gives independent scalability of PaaS and access to OS and hardware like IaaS.   Container -  An invisible box around your code and its dependencies, with limited access to its own partition of the file system and hardware. Simple to create and starts as a process. It is like virtualizing the OS. So you can go from development, to staging, to production, or from your laptop to the cloud, without changing or rebuilding anything.    Introduction to Kubernetes and GKE  Kubernetes makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them as microservices, and deploy rollouts and rollbacks. Docker - An open-source tool that defines a format for bundling your application, its dependencies, and machine-specific settings into a container; Google Container Builder - a tool similar to Docker. Use a Dockerfile to specify how your code gets packaged into a container. \u0026ldquo;docker build\u0026rdquo; command to build the container. This builds the container and stores it locally as a runnable image. \u0026ldquo;docker run\u0026rdquo; command to run the image. Kubernetes is a set of APIs that you can use to deploy containers on a set of nodes called a cluster  Introduction to Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Computing (Anthos)  The time required to complete an on-premises upgrade could be anywhere from several months to one or more years. It may also be quite costly. Hybrid/multi-cloud architecture allows you to keep parts of your systems infrastructure on-premises while moving other parts to the Cloud, creating an environment that is uniquely suited to your company\u0026rsquo;s needs. Anthos - hybrid and multi-cloud solution powered by the latest innovations in distributed systems, and service management software from Google. Anthos relies on Kubernetes and Google Kubernetes engine deployed on-prem.  Module 6 - Applications in the Cloud Key Concepts  Explain the purpose of and use cases for Google App Engine and Google Cloud Datastore Compare the App Engine Standard environment with the App Engine Flexible environment Express the purpose of and use cases for Google Cloud Endpoints Express the purpose of and use cases for Apigee Edge. Preview an App Engine application using Cloud Shell. Launch an App Engine application and then disable it.  Introduction to App Engine  App Engine is PaaS solution for building scalable web applications and mobile backends. It manages the infrastructure so that the consumers can focus on building applications. Provides you with hardware and networking infrastructure, built-in services and APIs such as NoSQL datastores, memcache, load balancing, health checks, application logging, and a user authentication API, common to most applications. No servers to maintain. App Engine will scale your application automatically in response to the amount of traffic it receives. Security Scanner automatically scans and detects common web application vulnerabilities. Works with popular development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, Maven, Git, Jenkins, and PyCharm.  Google App Engine Standard Environment  Containers are preconfigured with available runtimes which include libraries that support standard APIs Features  Persistent storage Asynchronous task queues, scheduled tasks for triggering events Integration with other Google cloud services   Limitations\n4. No writing to local file system\n5. Requests timeout at 60s\n6. 3rd part software installations are limited. Example standard workflow -\n7. Develop \u0026amp; test the web application locally\n8. Use the SDK to deploy to App Engine\n9. App Engine automatically scales \u0026amp; reliably serves your web application  Google App Engine Flexible Environment  Instead of the sandbox, App Engine Flexible Environment lets you specify the container your application runs in. Comparison with Standard  Standard - Instance startup in Milliseconds, SSH access No, Write to local disk No, Support for 3rd-party binaries No, Network access Via App Engine services, Pricing model - Daily free use, after that daily use, pay per instance class, with automatic shutdown Flexible - Instance startup in Minutes, SSH access Yes (needs to be enabled), Write to local disk Yes (ephemeral), Support for 3rd-party binaries Yes, Network access Yes, Pricing model - pay resource allocation per hour, no automatic shutdown.    Google Cloud Endpoints and Apigee Edge  Google Cloud Platform provides two API management tools.   Cloud Endpoints - A distributed API management system. It provides an API console, hosting, logging, monitoring, and other features to help you create, share, maintain, and secure your APIs. You can use Cloud Endpoints with any APIs that support the OpenAPI Specification (Swagger spec).   Uses distributed Extensible Service Proxy which is a service proxy based on NGINX that runs in its own Docker container for better isolation and scalability. Features  User authentication Automated deployment Logging and monitoring API keys Easy integration    Apigee Edge - A platform for developing and managing API proxies. It has a different orientation, though: it has a focus on business problems like rate limiting, quotas, and analytics.  Module 7 - Developing, Deploying and Monitoring in the Cloud Key Concepts  Understand options for software developers to host their source code. Understand the purpose of template-based creation and management of resources. Understand the purpose of integrated monitoring, alerting, and debugging. Build a Deployment Manager deployment. Update a Deployment Manager deployment. View the load on a VM instance using Stackdriver.  Development in the cloud  Cloud Source Repositories -  Provides Git version control to support collaborative development of any application or service, If you are using the Stackdriver Debugger, you can use Cloud Source Repositories and related tools to view debugging information alongside your code during application runtime CSR also provides a source viewer that you can use to browse and view repository files from within the Google Cloud Platform Console Similar to bitbucket, you can have any number of private repositories   Cloud Functions -  This is a cool concept. It is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small functions that execute without having to manage a server or a runtime environment. You are billed, to the nearest 100 milliseconds, only while your code is running. Cloud Functions are written in Javascript and execute in a managed Node.js environment on Google Cloud Platform.    Deployment: Infrastructure as code  Deployment Manager -  An infrastructure management service that automates the creation and management of GCP resources. To use Deployment Manager, you create a template file, using either the YAML markup language or Python, that describes what you want the components of your environment to look like. The Deployment Manager figures out and does the actions needed to create the environment your template describes.    Monitoring: Proactive instrumentation  Stackdriver -  GCP\u0026rsquo;s tool for monitoring, logging, and diagnostics. Gives you access to many different kinds of signals from your infrastructure platforms, virtual machines, containers, middleware, and application tier: logs, metrics, traces. Gives you insight into your application’s health, performance, and availability   6 core components of Google Stackdriver: monitoring, logging, trace, error reporting, debugging, profiler.  Module 8 - Big Data and Machine Learning in the Cloud Key Concepts  Understand the purpose of and use cases for the products in the Google Cloud big data platform.

This post is in response to that. First some context on what we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing.\nBackground Wife read the post on Oru Sangeerthanam Pole and really got fascinated by Perumbadavam and Dostoyevsky. She got busy reading articles on Dostoyevsky and Perumbadavam and also a couple of Perumbadavam\u0026rsquo;s interviews on Youtube. I joined in, and we watched a few interviews together. Other than reading the famous book accidentally, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know much about the man himself. What comes across through the interviews is the portrait of a humble, down-to-earth, emotional person. He definitely is an incredible human being. The interview with Shiny Jacob in a Church was great. An interview done by Rayson Kuriakose on the bank of a river, was also very touching.\nAK also started reading \u0026lsquo;The Brothers Karamazov\u0026rsquo;. Just the past week, she was reading an essay by Turgenev about an execution in Paris. Now that I think of it, she told me about Turgenev\u0026rsquo;s essay, and that\u0026rsquo;s probably when I remembered that I had a copy of \u0026lsquo;Crime and Punishment\u0026rsquo;, looked it up and remembered how I happened to get the book and how I got to know about Dostoyevsky. Ah, many times, it is great to unravel why we got into something; Why did we start reading that particular book?, Why did we start watching a specific TV series or a movie?, Why did we start talking about a topic that we never touched upon for years?, etc. While talking to her after writing the post, I was a bit confused about when I actually read \u0026lsquo;Oru Sangeerthanam Pole\u0026rsquo;. It might have been at Viveknagar library as I mentioned in the earlier post. It might also have been at Babuchan\u0026rsquo;s house. Or it might have been in Manorama weekly. What I clearly remember are the black and white illustrations of specific scenes on some pages. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been fond of illustrations in books since they reveal a lot. It is also a chance to check where in the book that scene occurred.\nWe also got talking about our interest in Russian literature and how unbeknownst to us, it was an influential force. It might have been through movies or friends or other connections. That too, we both are Malayalis who grew up outside Kerala. If we had grown up in Kerala, the influence might have been higher. Realized that the village bordering Tengana, the place where we have a home in Kerala, is named Moscow! Haha. Yes, we have visited Moscow in Kerala.\nAnyway, here are some articles that I was able to lookup on Google about Kerala\u0026rsquo;s connection with the Soviet Union, especially with literature.\nArtiles on Kerala-Russia connection  Kerala\u0026rsquo;s Love Affair with Soviet Literature by Maya Palit. Oct 6, 2016.   She starts with the story of how here uncle gifted her books by Russian author Lyudmila Petrushevskaya and how she found the stories very relatable. Then she talks about the success of Oru Sangeerthanam Pole in the 90s, and about the docu-fiction film In Return — Just a Book, based on the novel, directed by Shiny Jacob and scripted by the famous writer, Paul Zacharia. She mentions that though Communist thought entered Kerala and began taking root in the 1930s and 40s, it was in the 50s that Russian literature was introduced to the public. Kesari Balakrishna Pillai was one of the initial people to bring Russian translations to the common people. He started with translations of Chekhov\u0026rsquo;s books and published through Kesari, a periodical that he ran. In 1952, Prabhath Book House got the rights to import Russian books. The books, especially the periodicals, were heavily subsidized by the Sovient Union and they cost only Rs. 2 or 3. NK Damodaran\u0026rsquo;s was the first to translate Dostoevsky\u0026rsquo;s works from English to Malayalam. She mentions that the real harbinger of Russian literature in a massive way, was a man named K \u0026lsquo;Moscow\u0026rsquo; Gopalakrishnan. In 1966, the Soviet government decided to publish Russian writings in Malayalam. They invited Gopalakrishnan, who was the joint editor of the \u0026lsquo;Soviet Review\u0026rsquo; in Delhi at the time, to Progress Printers in Moscow. He and his wife Omana Gopalakrishnan, translated close to 200 Russian books into Malayalam, including Party literature, folk tales, the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin etc. Maya quotes author KR Meera saying \u0026ldquo;The children of the 70s were shaped more by the Soviet Union than India.\u0026rdquo; Maya talks about friends who remember their introduction to Dostoevsky, Gorky and Tolstoy through Malayalam publications, which by all accounts, were very colorful, printed on great quality paper, beautifully-produced and really cheap. Also talks about children\u0026rsquo;s magazine named \u0026lsquo;Sputnik\u0026rsquo;. She quotes KR Meera saying that Russian literature was everywhere, that before brown paper came along, they used to cover notebooks for school with the glossy paper from Soviet Land magazines! She ends with a note that Kerala\u0026rsquo;s lyublyu (love) for Russian literature appears to have tempered down and that the new generation definitely has missed out. I agree.

Been thinking of doing that. Will do it one of these days. Today\u0026rsquo;s WSJ had a section in the end on Cybersecurity. It had interesting articles like \u0026ldquo;The industries most vulnerable to cyberattack and why\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;How and when to teach kids to use passwords\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The dangerous secrets our photos reveal\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The added security risks of working from home\u0026rdquo;, etc. Each article was well articulated and thought provoking.\nWhat caught my attention was an article named \u0026ldquo;A cybersecurity reading list\u0026rdquo;. I checked online and the same article was titled \u0026ldquo;Five Cybersecurity Books That Everyone Should and Can Read\u0026rdquo;. Though I\u0026rsquo;ve linked the article here, you might not be able to see it since it is probably paywalled.\nI was eager to see if the list had books that I\u0026rsquo;ve read or heard about. Unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;d heard of only 2 books - \u0026ldquo;Countdown to Zero Day\u0026rdquo; by Kim Zetter and \u0026ldquo;The Cuckoo\u0026rsquo;s Egg\u0026rdquo; by Clifford Stoll. The Cuckoo\u0026rsquo;s Egg is on my Amazon wishlist but haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to buying or reading it yet. I\u0026rsquo;d read of Cyberattack being referred to as the \u0026ldquo;Fifth Domain\u0026rdquo; of warfare but didn\u0026rsquo;t know about the book. But I haven\u0026rsquo;t read any and surely must read a couple before the end of the year.\nTop 5 books from WSJ article The 5 books are as follows -\n  Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World\u0026rsquo;s First Digital Weapon by Kim Zetter. Stuxnet is regarded as the world\u0026rsquo;s first digital weapon. It is the malware that crippled Iran\u0026rsquo;s nuclear-fuel enrichment program. In the book, Kim Zetter investigates the malware and provides a detailed account of the timeline from origin to release. Along the way, she explains key cybersecurity concepts.\n  The Cuckoo\u0026rsquo;s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage by Clifford Stoll. Lawrence Berkeley Lab is less than an hour\u0026rsquo;s drive from my home. So it actually feels like something that happened right here. In the book, Stoll is assigned to investigate an accounting error of 75 cents and that leads into a computer espionage story of chasing after an unauthorized user who was in their systems. I\u0026rsquo;m excited at the thought of reading this.\n  The Fifth Domain: Defending Our Country, Our Companies, and Ourselves in the Age of Cyber Threats by Richard Clarke and Robert Knake. The authors are former government cyber officials from the past 3 administrations. They describe the current efforts to advance security and prevent cyberwarfare and also analyze incidents from the past. The book is a warning as well as a study guide for everyone to understand the looming threat of cyber warfare.\n  Cult of the Dead Cow by Joseph Menn. I have a newfound respect for Beto O\u0026rsquo;Rourke after learning that he was part of cDc (Cult of the Dead Cow) which is the oldest, most respected, and most famous American hacking group of all time.\n  Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin\u0026rsquo;s Most Dangerous Hackers by Andy Greenberg. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the title is a reference to the giant sandworms in Dune/Arrakis. Those are huge and dangerous beings with mouth as large as 40 meters (over 100 ft!!). For a description of Dune\u0026rsquo;s sandworms see Ultimate Guide To Dune (Part 1) The Introduction(12:13). In Sandworm (the book), Andy Greenberg, a journalist for Wired, writes about cyber incidents from 2014 to the release of NotPetya malware in 2017. Causing over $10 billion in damage, the malware destroyed public utilities (especially Electric grids) in Ukraine and other European countries.\n  Thought I\u0026rsquo;d do a Google search of \u0026ldquo;Cybersecurity Books That Everyone Should Read\u0026rdquo; to add to this list, or may be make it to 10.\nOther top security book lists The Best Cyber Security Books recommended by Josephine Wolff has the following -\n Spam Nation: The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime-from Global Epidemic to Your Front Door by Brian Krebs Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World\u0026rsquo;s First Digital Weapon by Kim Zetter Worm: The First Digital World War by Mark Bowden Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War by Fred Kaplan Bytes, Bombs, and Spies: The Strategic Dimensions of Offensive Cyber Operations by Amy Zegart \u0026amp; Herbert Lin  The 11 Best Cyber Security Books — Recommendations from the Experts from HashedOut has the following\n Hacking: The Art of Exploitation (2nd Ed.) by Jon Erickson The Art of Invisibility: The World’s Most Famous Hacker Teaches You How to Be Safe in the Age of Big Brother and Big Data by Kevin Mitnick Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World’s Most Wanted Hacker by Kevin Mitnick, William L. Simon The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography by Simon Singh Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World by Joseph Menn Social Engineering: The Science of Human Hacking by Christopher Hadnagy Practical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski The CERT Guide to Insider Threats by Dawn M. Cappelli, Andrew P. Moore, Randall F. Trzeciak The Cyber Effect by Mary Aiken Hacking Exposed 7: Network Security Secrets and Solutions by Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, George Kurtz Threat Modeling: Designing for Security by Adam Shostack  I was glad to see Simon Singh\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Code Book\u0026rdquo;, though. I think WSJ\u0026rsquo;s 5-book recommendation is great for a beginner and covers a lot of topics to get some real insights.\nOf course, there are always thousands of lists and a lot of choices. But a better strategy to get through the books is to have a smaller set to read or to have a couple of text books that you read over and again. For e.g. CLRS book on Algorithms.\n","description":"","id":15,"section":"tech-notes","tags":null,"title":"A Cybersecurity Book List","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/tech-notes/2020-06-22-cybersecurity-reading-list/"},{"content":"Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks 1st Edition1\nThoughts There is no better time to read this book than now.

In spite of all the hard work behind maintaining a centralized firewall, configuring TLS across various applications, doing penetration testing and auditing, once the perimeter is breached, there is no defense. The hosts in the internal network are in the trusted zone and rely so much on the wall that if an attacker gains access to internal network, say through phishing, then it is free-access to all the internal resources.\nZero-trust model is one which treats all hosts as if they’re internet-facing, and considers the entire network to be compromised and hostile.\nThe book is very well written and teaches concepts one after the other never jumping into a complex topic without background.\nTOC 1.

I had heard of two models in the past - STRIDE and DREAD in the context of security thread classification and ranking for Cyber-physical systems Seifert \u0026amp; Reza (2016).\nBefore going into the popular models, what is Threat Modeling? There was a small section on Threat Modeling in the IT Security course that I wrote about recently. It mentions that Security Risk assessment starts with Threat Modeling. The goal is to identify likely threats to systems, assign them priorities that correspond to severity and probability. This is done by brainstorming from the perspective of an outside attacker and figuring out what high value targets an attacker may want to go after, and then review possible attack vectors that could be used to gain access to the high value assets.\nThe book mentions the following and I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do a quick read on the other 3 to find out what they are and summarize all of them.\n STRIDE DREAD PASTA Trike VAST  STRIDE and DREAD were developed at Microsoft. Chapter 3 of Improving Web Application Security: Threats and Countermeasures talks in detail about these. STRIDE is used in \u0026lsquo;Step 4. Identify the Threats\u0026rsquo; and DREAD in \u0026lsquo;Step 6. Rate the Threats\u0026rsquo;.\nSTRIDE STRIDE is derived from an acronym for the following six threat categories. The goal is to bucketize the threats into these categories.\n Spoofing identity Tampering with data Repudiation Information disclosure Denial of service Elevation of privilege  DREAD Once classification is done, DREAD acronym can be used to asking the following questions to arrive at a risk rating.\n Damage potential: How great is the damage if the vulnerability is exploited? Reproducibility: How easy is it to reproduce the attack? Exploitability: How easy is it to launch an attack? Affected users: As a rough percentage, how many users are affected? Discoverability: How easy is it to find the vulnerability?  The chapter has a Risk rating table that is very useful in coming up with a combined rating.\nPASTA PASTA is an acronym for \u0026lsquo;Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis\u0026rsquo;. It provides a seven-step process for aligning business objectives and technical requirements, taking into account compliance issues and business analysis. The intent of the method is to provide a dynamic threat identification, enumeration, and scoring process.\nTrike Trike is an open source threat modeling methodology and tool. There are two implementations of Trike. One is a spreadsheet, and the other is a standalone desktop tool. The high level idea is to model threats based on requirements of a system (assets) and the \u0026lsquo;acceptable\u0026rsquo; level of risk defined by stakeholders of the requirements.\nVAST VAST is an acronym for Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat. It is based on an automated threat-modeling platform named ThreatModeler, creates two types of models - Application and Operational threat models. Application model represents architectural POV and Operational model represents attacker POV.\nMore Models This article from CMU is more comprehensive and goes over 12 threat models - https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2018/12/threat-modeling-12-available-methods.html\nThreat Modeling tools The wiki page on Thread Modeling mentions many tools used for Threat Modeling. Of the list, I\u0026rsquo;ve used SD Elements in the past. In that, the first step is to complete a questionnaire (created based on compliance requirements) and the system generates a set of threat vectors and actions that need to be taken to overcome the threats.\nReferences   STRIDE \u0026amp; DREAD in CPS : Seifert, Darren, and Hassan Reza. \u0026ldquo;A security analysis of cyber-physical systems architecture for healthcare.\u0026rdquo; Computers 5, no. 4 (2016): 27.\n  STRIDE \u0026amp; DREAD - Meier, J.

It is a great refresher of a lot of cybersecurity concepts that most engineers might have heard of but not know. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know much, it would be much more useful since you\u0026rsquo;ll have a better knowledge of the attack vectors and all vulnerabilities that surround us daily. If you know, it will help in filling up many blank spots in your knowledge.\nThe enthusiasm, knowledge, expertise, and the presentation skills of the instructor Gian Spicuzza, who is a Program Manager with the Android Security team, really was the differentiator, in addition to the content of the course. He definitely is my model Program Manager, someone who is great technically and is able to articulate his ideas very well. After the course, I\u0026rsquo;m confident of being able to teach an introductory course in IT Security.\nCourse Link - https://www.coursera.org/learn/it-security/\nTime Commitment \u0026amp; Learning Strategy\nFor someone who has a foundation in CS and had some experience, I think the course can be done in a week\u0026rsquo;s time by spending around 2 hours per day. My strategy was to watch the videos (say at 1.5x speed) while on the move (say running on the treadmill), download the transcripts, and read through them while sitting, review transcripts while answering the quizzes. Most of the learning comes from answering the questions in the quizzes and the qwiklab labs. I thoroughly loved the qwiklab labs. They were the best hands-on learning experience that I had.\nIf the course creators had shared the slides, the learning strategy could be\n Attempt the quizzes Go through the slides Review some videos for concepts that are not clear. Attempt the quizzes again to possibly score 100% Do the hands-on labs  Notes Week 1 - Understanding Security Threats Key Concepts\n Define and recognize security risks, vulnerabilities and threats. Be able to identify the most common security attacks. Understand how security revolves around the CIA principle.  Introduction to IT Security\n Intro to the instructor - Gian Spicuzza, Overview of the course, other stuff about navigating coursera, using discussion forum, etc.  Malicious Software\n The CIA Triad  CIA = confidentiality, integrity, and availability Confidentiality - keeping things hidden Integrity - keeping data accurate and untampered Availability - Information is readily accessible for those who need it   Essential Security Terms  Risk - possibility of suffering a loss Vulnerability - holes that you may or may not be aware of. 0-day vulnerability (zero-day) - A type of vulnerability that is not known to the software dev or vendor but to the attacker. Exploit - Software that is used to take advantage of a vulnerability. Threat - possibility of danger that could exploit a vulnerability Hacker - someone who attempts to break into or exploit a system. black hat hackers, white hat hackers. Attack - An actual attempt at causing harm to a system   Malicious Software  Malware - (malicious software) that can be used to obtain your sensitive information or delete or modify files. viruses, worms, adware, spyware, Trojans, root kids, backdoors, botnets, .. Virus - virus affects a program and replicates itself on files that the program touches, does the malicious work it\u0026rsquo;s intended to do, and repeats this over and over. Worms - similar to viruses except that instead of having to attach themselves onto something to spread, worms can live on their own and spread through channels like the network. Adware - software that displays advertisements and collects data. Trojan - malware that disguises itself as one thing but does something else Spyware - malware that monitors your computer screens, key presses, webcams, and then reports/streams all of this information to another party. Ransomware - type of attack that holds your data or system hostage until you pay some sort of ransom   Malware Continued  Bots - steals computer resources Botnets are designed to utilize the power of the Internet-connected machines to perform some distributed function. E.g. bitcoin mining. Backdoor - a secret entryway for attackers Rootkit - admin access. Allows admin level modification to an operating system logic bomb - a type of Malware that\u0026rsquo;s intentionally installed, after a certain event or time has triggered, it will run the malicious program    Network Attacks\n Network Attacks  A DNS Cache Poisoning attack works by tricking a DNS server into accepting a fake DNS record that will point you to a compromised DNS server.  A man-in-the-middle attack, is an attack that places the attacker in the middle of two hosts that think they\u0026rsquo;re communicating directly with each other A rogue AP is an access point that is installed on the network without the network administrator\u0026rsquo;s knowledge\nEvil twin attack is for you to connect to a network that is identical to yours.     Denial-of-Service  DoS (Denial of Service) attack, is an attack that tries to prevent access to a service for legitimate users by overwhelming the network or server. Ping of Death (POD) - sending malformed ping to a computer. Ping flood - sending tons of ping packets to a system SYN flood - server is being bombarded with the SYN packets Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) - A DoS attack using multiple systems    Other Attacks\n Client-Side Attacks  Injection attacks - inject malicious code to be executed in the system Cross-site scripting, or XSS attacks - attacker can insert malicious code and target the user of the service SQL injection attack - targets a website if it is using a SQL database   Password Attacks  Brute force attack - continuously try different combinations Dictionary attack - tries commonly used passwords from a dictionary   Deceptive Attacks  Social engineering is an attack method that relies heavily on interactions with humans. attackers use deceptive techniques to get access. Phishing attack - fake email that seems trustworthy due to the logo and color combinations. Spoofing - source is masquerading around as something else Baiting - attacker could leave a USB and an innocent person could take it and put it in to their computer thinking it is free. Tailgating - entering a building immediate after someone    Week 2 - Pelcgbybtl (Cryptology) Key Concepts\n Understand the how symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing work. Describe the most common algorithms of cryptography. Choose the most appropriate cryptographic method given a scenario.  Symmetric Encryption\n Cryptography  The topic of cryptography, or hiding messages from potential enemies, has been around for thousands of years. It has evolved greatly now with the advent of modern technology, computers and telecommunications. Encryption is the act of taking a message, called plaintext, and applying an operation to it, called a cipher, and creating a garbled/unreadable/different from original message, called ciphertext. The reverse process, is called decryption. A cipher is actually made up of two components, the encryption algorithm and the key. The algorithm is the underlying logic and is usually complex mathematical operations. The key is something unique to the specific cipher in use. Kerckhoff\u0026rsquo;s principle (Shannon\u0026rsquo;s maxim / \u0026lsquo;enemy knows the system\u0026rsquo;) - This principle states that a cryptosystem, or a collection of algorithms for key generation and encryption and decryption operations that comprise a cryptographic service should remain secure, even if everything about the system is known except for the key. Cryptography - overarching discipline that covers the practice of coding and hiding messages from third parties Cryptology - Study of cryptography Cryptanalysis - trying to decipher coded messages (Reminded of Dan Brown\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Da Vinci Code\u0026rdquo;). E.g. of a machine - Collossus during World war 1 Steganography - practice of hiding information from observers, but not encoding it. (like writing a message using Invisible Ink!) A note in the reading material - A mentioned above, the algorithm for encryption is usually complex mathematical operations. Mostly it is large prime number factorization which is currently computationally difficult. But if quantum computing become a reality, then brute force attacks to break the keys would be easier.   Symmetric Cryptography  Symmetric Cryptography - Use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages. For e.g. ROT-13 is a Caesar cipher that uses a key of 13, which means a text is encrypted by rotating each character in the alphabet by 13 letters. Stream cipher - takes a stream of input and encrypts the stream one character or one digit at a time, outputting one encrypted character or digit at a time. So, there\u0026rsquo;s a one- to-one relationship between data in and encrypted data out. block cipher - takes data in, places that into a bucket or block of data that\u0026rsquo;s a fixed size, then encodes that entire block as one unit. Initialization vector (IV) - Random data that\u0026rsquo;s integrated into the encryption key and the resulting combined key is then used to encrypt the data. This is to avoid key reuse. IV is sent in plaintext along with the encrypted message. e.g - 802.11 frame of a WEP encrypted wireless packet.   Symmetric Encryption Algorithms  DES (Data Encryption Standard) - designed by IBM in the 70s with inputs from NSA. Was adopted as an official FIPS, Federal Information Processing Standard for the US. DES is a symmetric block cipher that uses 64-bit key sizes and operates on blocks 64-bits in size. Since 8-bits are used for parity checking, in reality, the key length is 56 bits. This means there are 2^56 or 72 quadrillion possible keys to guess from. In the 70s, it seemed like a huge task to determine the key using brute force but in 1998 the EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation, decrypted a DES-encrypted message in only 56 hours! In 2001, NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology, adopted AES, Advanced Encryption Standard. AES is the first and only public cipher that\u0026rsquo;s approved for use with top secret information by NSA. AES is similar to DES but it uses 128-bit blocks, twice the size of DES blocks, and supports key lengths of 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit. Key things to note while adopting an algorithm -\u0026gt; Should be implementable in software or hardware, should be easy to implement, should be fast enough. Some platforms implement cryptographic algorithms in hardware to accelerate the processes and remove some of the burden from the CPU. RC4, or Rivest Cipher 4, is a symmetric stream cipher that gained widespread adoption because of its simplicity and speed. RC4 is not used anymore. Though it supports key sizes from 40-bits to 2,048-bits, the cipher itself has inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities that have been exploited many times. RC4 was used in many protocols - WEP for wireless encryption, WPA, was used in SSL and TLS till 2015. The preferred secure configuration is TLS 1.2 with AES GCM, a specific mode of operation for the AES block cipher that essentially turns it into a stream cipher. GCM, or Galois/Counter Mode, works by taking randomized seed value, incrementing this and encrypting the value, creating sequentially numbered blocks of ciphertexts.\nSymmetric encryption is very convenient. But the key issue is with the fact that same key is used and it needs to be shared.    Public Key or Asymmetric Encryption\n Asymmetric Cryptography  Asymmetric encryption - different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt. Process - generate a private key, then using this private key, generate a public key. It should be almost impossible (computationally very difficult) to figure out corresponding private key given a public key. Person A uses Person B\u0026rsquo;s public key to encrypt the message which the Person B decrypts using his private key. Digital signature - If Person B also wants to validate that the message came from Person A, then Person A could compose the message and combine it with his/her private key to generate a digital signature. Person B could use Person A\u0026rsquo;s public key to validate the signature. Asymmetric cryptosystem grants us - confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation. Confidentiality is granted through the encryption-decryption mechanism Authenticity is granted by the digital signature mechanism Non-repudiation is granted by digital signature \u0026amp; encryption/decryption mechanism. The person who is sending the message cannot deny that it was sent from them. Hybrid - Asymmetric is used to share keys and symmetric is used for actual data encryption/decryption. This also safety as well as speed. A MAC (Message Authentication Code) is a bit of information that allows authentication of a received message, ensuring that the message came from the alleged sender. Similar to digital signature. Popular - HMAC (Keyed-Hash MAC). HMAC uses a cryptographic hash function along with a secret key to generate a MAC.   Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms  RSA - Rivest Shamir Adleman. Released to public domain by RSA Security in the year 2000. DSA - Digital Signature Algorithm - used for signing and verifying data DH - Diffie-Hellman - key exchange algorithm ECC - Elliptic curve cryptography is a public key encryption system that uses the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields to generate secure keys. The benefit of elliptic curve based encryption systems is that they are able to achieve security similar to traditional public key systems with smaller key sizes. So, for example, a 256 bit elliptic curve key, would be comparable to a 3,072 bit RSA key. ECDH and ECDSA - elliptic curve variants of DH and DSA    Hashing\n Hashing  Hashing (hash function) - a type of function or operation that takes in an arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of a fixed size, called a hash or a digest. output is unique to the input, such that two different inputs should never yield the same output. Cryptographic hash functions are used for various applications like authentication, message integrity, fingerprinting, data corruption detection and digital signatures. Cryptographic hash function should be one-directional, deterministic, quick to compute and be efficient, not possible to retrieve plain text, small change in input should result in a different output and there should be no correlation b/w input change and output, not have hash collisions.   Hashing Algorithms  MD5 is a popular and widely used hash function designed in the early 1990s as a cryptographic hashing function. It operates on a 512 bit blocks and generates 128 bit hash digests. Due to the vulnerabilities in the hash function (hash collision issue), it was recommended to stop using MD5 for cryptographic applications by 2010. SHA-1 is part of the secure hash algorithm suite of functions, designed by the NSA and published in 1995. It operates a 512 bit blocks and generates 160 bit hash digest. SHA-1 is another widely used cryptographic hashing functions, used in popular protocols like TLS/SSL, PGP SSH, and IPsec. SHA-1 is also used in version control systems like Git, which uses hashes to identify revisions and ensure data integrity by detecting corruption or tampering. Many organizations have recommended replacing SHA-1 with SHA-2 or SHA-3 due to vulnerabilities in SHA-1 A MIC (message integrity check) - a hash digest of the message, a checksum to ensure integrity. It is different from MAC and the main goal is protecting against accidental corruption or loss, but not protecting against tampering.   Hashing Algorithms (continued)  Think of passwords for user login. The password is usually hashed and stored so that a bad action will not be able to get the plain text. Sometimes it is hashed multiple times making the retrieval even harder for malicious actors. Rainbow table - a pre-computed table of all possible password values and their corresponding hashes. SALT - A password salt is additional randomized data that\u0026rsquo;s added into the hashing function to generate the hash that\u0026rsquo;s unique to the password and salt combination.    Cryptography Applications\n Public Key Infrastructure  PKI is a system that defines the creation, storage and distribution of digital certificates. A digital certificate is a file that proves that an entity owns a certain public key. A certificate contains information about the public key, the entity it belongs to and a digital signature from another party that has verified this information. CA (Certificate Authority) - The entity that\u0026rsquo;s responsible for storing, issuing, and signing certificates RA (Registration Authority) - Responsible for verifying the identities of any entities requesting certificates to be signed and stored with the CA. Usually CA performs both. SSL or TLS server certificate. This is a certificate that a web server presents to a client as part of the initial secure setup of an SSL, TLS connection. Self Sign Certificate - The certificate has been signed by the same entity that issued the certificate. SSL or TLS client certificate - certificates that are bound to clients and are used to authenticate the client to the server, allowing access control to a SSL, TLS service. code signing certificates - used for signing executable programs Root Certificate Authority. These root certificates are self signed because they are the start of the chain of trust. If the root CA signs a certificate and sets a field in the certificate called CA to true, this marks a certificate as an intermediary or subordinate CA. What this means is that the entity that this certificate was issued to can now sign other certificates. And so, on building a chain. Each major OS vendor ships a large number of trusted root CA certificates with their OS Fields in the X.509 standard -  Version, what version of the X.509 standard certificate adheres to. Serial number, a unique identifier for their certificate assigned by the CA which allows the CA to manage and identify individual certificates. Certificate Signature Algorithm, this field indicates what public key algorithm is used for the public key and what hashing algorithm is used to sign the certificate. Issuer Name, this field contains information about the authority that signed the certificate. Validity, this contains two subfields, Not Before and Not After, which define the dates when the certificate is valid for. Subject, this field contains identifying information about the entity the certificate was issued to. Subject Public Key Info, these two subfields define the algorithm of the public key along with the public key itself. Certificate Signature Value - the digital signature data Certificate fingerprints which aren\u0026rsquo;t actually fields in the certificate itself, but are computed by clients when validating or inspecting certificates. These are just hash digests of the whole certificate.   A Web of Trust - Where individuals instead of certificate authorities sign other individuals\u0026rsquo; public keys. Before an individual signs a key, they should first verify the person\u0026rsquo;s identity through an agreed upon mechanism.  Key Signing Parties - Group of participants perform verification and signing. At the end of the party everyone\u0026rsquo;s public key should have been signed by every other participant establishing a web of trust.     Cryptography in Action  HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Also called HTTP over SSL or TLS since it\u0026rsquo;s essentially encapsulating the HTTP traffic over an encrypted, secured channel utilizing SSL or TLS. SSL was deprecated in 2015, and TLS 1.2 is the current recommended revision. TLS is a generic protocol to permit secure communications and authentication over a network. TLS is also used to secure other communications aside from web browsing, like VoIP calls such as Skype or\nHangouts, email, instant messaging, and even Wi-Fi network security. TLS grants 3 things -  One, a secure communication line, which means data being transmitted is protected from potential eavesdroppers. Two, the ability to authenticate both parties communicating, though typically, only the server is authenticated by the client. And three, the integrity of communications, meaning there are checks to ensure that messages aren\u0026rsquo;t lost or altered in transit.   Steps  ClientHello - Client includes information about the client, like the version of the TLS that the client supports, a list of cipher suites that it supports, and maybe some additional TLS options. ServerHello - Server selects the highest protocol version in common with the client, and chooses a cipher suite from the list to use. It also transmits its digital certificate and a final ServerHelloDone message. Client Validation - The client will then validate the certificate that the server sent over to ensure that it\u0026rsquo;s trusted and it\u0026rsquo;s for the appropriate host name. Assuming the certificate checks out, the client then sends a ClientKeyExchange message. This is when the client chooses a key exchange mechanism to securely establish a shared secret with the server. It then sends ChangeCipherSpec message indicating that it\u0026rsquo;s switching to secure communications now. Followed by encrypted Finished message. Server response - The server replies with a ChangeCipherSpec and an encrypted Finished message once the shared secret is received.   SSH (Secure Shell) uses public key cryptography to authenticate the remote machine that the client is connecting to, and has provisions to allow user authentication via client certificates, if desired. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) - An encryption application that allows authentication of data along with privacy from third parties. Very secure. Has been compared to military grade encryption. Designed to use keys no smaller than 128 bit.   Securing Network Traffic  A VPN is a mechanism that allows you to remotely connect a host or network to an internal private network, passing the data over a public channel, like the Internet. A sort of encrypted tunnel. IPsec, or Internet Protocol Security, is a VPN protocol that was designed in conjunction with IPv6.  It works by encrypting an IP packet and encapsulating the encrypted packet inside an IPsec packet. This encrypted packet then gets routed to the VPN endpoint where the packet is de-encapsulated and decrypted then sent to the final destination. IPsec supports two modes of operations, transport mode and tunnel mode. When transport mode is used, only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted, leaving the IP headers untouched. In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet, header, payload, and all, is encrypted and encapsulated inside a new IP packet with new headers.   L2TP, or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, is a simple tunneling protocol that allows encapsulation of different protocols. The tunnel is provided by L2TP, secure channel is provided by Ipsec. L2TP IPsec (combination of L2TP and IPSec) was officially standardized in ietf RFC 3193 OpenVPN uses the OpenSSL library to handle key exchange and encryption of data, along with control channels.   Cryptographic Hardware  Trusted Platform Module or TPM - is a hardware device that\u0026rsquo;s typically integrated into the hardware of a computer, that\u0026rsquo;s a dedicated crypto processor. TPM offers secure generation of keys, random number generation, remote attestation, and data binding and sealing. Secure element. Similar to a TPM, it\u0026rsquo;s a tamper resistant chip often embedded in the microprocessor or integrated into the mainboard of a mobile device. Full Disk Encryption or FDE, is the practice of encrypting the entire drive in the system. E.g - Bitlocker from Microsoft, Filevault 2 from Apple, open source software dm-crypt.    Week 3 - AAA Security (Not Roadside Assistance) Key Concepts\n Identify and describe the most common authentication services. Understand and be able to choose the most appropriate method of authentication or authorization. Be able to grant the appropriate level of access for the users of an organization.  Authentication\n Authentication Best Practices  Identification is the idea of describing an entity uniquely. Authentication - to go about proving you are who you claim to be (AuthN) Authorization - pertains to the resources and identity has access to (AuthZ) A good password policy system would enforce length requirements, character complexity, and check for the presence of dictionary words, which would undermine the strength of password.   Multifactor Authentication  Multifactor authentication is a system where users are authenticated by presenting multiple pieces of information (factors). 3 types of factors - Something you know, something you have, and something you are. Something you know - password, pin, etc. something you have - physical token, card, etc. something you are - retina scan, fingerprint Physical tokens - RSA securId token - It\u0026rsquo;s a small, battery-powered device with an LCD display, that shows a One-Time-Password that\u0026rsquo;s rotated periodically. The seed value is used in conjunction with the current time to generate a One-Time-Password. Another common method is delivering OTP via sms to mobile phones. Issue - SMS isn\u0026rsquo;t encrypted, nor is it private. And it\u0026rsquo;s possible for SMS to be intercepted by a well-funded attacker. Biometric - Biometric characteristics can be super difficult to change in the event that they are compromised unlike passwords. So usually hash of fingerprint is stored instead of the actual data. U2F or Universal Second Factor - U2F incorporates a challenge-response mechanism, along with public key cryptography to implement a more secure and more convenient second-factor authentication solution   Certificates  In order to issue client certificates, an organization must set up and maintain CA infrastructure to issue and sign certificates.   LDAP  LDAP, or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, is an open industry-standard protocol for accessing and maintaining directory services Bind - how clients authenticate to the server. StartTLS, which permits a client to communicate using LDAP v3 over TLS. Unbind - closes connection.   RADIUS  RADIUS or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service, is a protocol that provides AAA services for users on a network. When a client wants to access a resource that\u0026rsquo;s protected, the client will present authentication credentials to a NAS or Network Access Server which will relay the credentials to the RADIUS server. Once the RADIUS server has evaluated the user authentication request, it replies with one of three messages access reject, access challenge or access accept.   Kerberos  Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses tickets to allow entities to prove their identity over potentially insecure channels to provide mutual authentication. Kerberos supports AES encryption, and implements checksums to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The authentication tickets let users authenticate to services without requiring username and password authentication for every service individually The first message is the encrypted client to server ticket received from the Ticket Granting Service. The second is a new authenticator with the client ID and time stamp encrypted using the client-server session key. The SS decrypts the first message using its secret key which provides it with the client-server session key. The key is then used to decrypt the second message, and it compares the client ID in the authenticator to the one included in the client to server ticket. If these IDs match, then the SS sends a message containing the time stamp from the client supplied authenticator encrypted using the client-server session key. The client, then decrypts this message, and checks that the time stamp is correct authenticating the server. If this all succeeds, then the server grants access to the requested service on the client.   TACACS+  TACACS+ (Terminal Access controller Access-Control System Plus) - Cisco developed AAA protocol that was released as an open standard in 1993. TACACS+ is primarily used for device administration, authentication, authorization, and accounting, as opposed to RADIUS, which is mostly used for network access AAA   Single Sign-On  SSO (Single Sign-On) is accomplished by authenticating to a central authentication server, like an LDAP server. This then provides a cookie, or token that can be used to get access to applications configured to use SSO. Kerberos is actually a good example of an SSO authentication service. The user would authenticate against the Kerberos service once, which would then grant them a ticket granting ticket. This can then be presented to the ticket granting service in place of traditional credentials. So, the user can enter credentials once and gain access to a variety of services. openID - centralized authentication system, is an open standard that allows participating sites known as Relying Parties to allow authentication of users utilizing a third party authentication service.    Authorization\n Authorization and Access Control Methods  Authorization pertains to describing what the user account has access to or doesn\u0026rsquo;t have access to. Kerberos - After user is authenticated and receives a TGT, it can be used to request access to a specific service by sending a request to Ticket-granting service (TGS). The TGS will decide whether or not the user in question is permitted to access the service being requested.   Access Control  OAuth is an open standard that allows users to grant third-party websites and applications access to their information without sharing account credentials. User needs to confirm if they grant access or not. Once confirmed, the identity provider will supply the third party with a token that gives them access to the user\u0026rsquo;s information. The provider issues an access token which would have a scope to do specific things. OAuth is specifically an authorization system and OpenID is an authentication system OpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 designed to improve upon OpenID and build better integration with OAuth authorizations   Access Control List  An access control list or ACL, is a way of defining permissions or authorizations for objects. A file system would have an ACL, which is a table or database with a list of entries specifying access rights for individuals or groups for various objects on the file system like folders, files or programs. These individual access permissions per object are called Access Control Entries Network ACLs are used for restricting and controlling access to hosted services running on hosts within your network.    Accounting\n Tracking Usage and Access  Accounting - keeping records of what resources and services your users access or what they did when they were using your systems. Auditing - involves reviewing these records to ensure that nothing is out of the ordinary TACACS+ server would be more concerned with keeping track of user authentication, what systems they authenticated to, and what commands they ran during their session RADIUS will track details like session duration, client location and bandwidth, or other resources used during the session.    Week 4 - Securing Your Networks Key Concepts\n Implement security measures on a network environment. Understand the risks of wireless networks and how to mitigate them. Understand how to monitor network traffic and read packet captures.  Secure Network Architecture\n Network Hardening Best Practices  Network hardening is the process of securing a network by reducing its potential vulnerabilities through configuration changes, and taking specific steps. General security principle - Disable unnecessary extra services or restrict access to them. Implicit deny - A network security concept where anything not explicitly permitted or allowed should be denied. Whitelist instead of blacklist. Monitoring \u0026amp; analyzing network traffic is important. Establish a baseline of what your typical network traffic looks like. Splunk is an example of a good tool to use to analyze logs. Correlation analysis is the process of taking log data from different systems, and matching events across the systems Flood guards provide protection against DoS or denial of service attacks. Network segmentation/separation, using VLANs to create virtual networks for different device classes or types, provides some security benefits.   Network Hardware Hardening  Rogue DHCP server attack - Attacker manages to deploy a rogue DHCP server on your network, which hands out DHCP leases - setting up gateway address and gaining access to traffic to/from the network. DHCP snooping - A switch that has DHCP snooping will monitor DHCP traffic being sent across it, will also track IP assignments and map them to hosts connected to switch ports. Also protects against IP spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks. ARP man-in-the-middle attack - An attacker could forge an ARP response, advertising its MAC address as the physical address matching a victim\u0026rsquo;s IP address. When this happens, all of the clients on the local network segment would cache this ARP entry. Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) - Another feature on enterprise switches that prevents ARP MIM attack. It requires the use of DHCP snooping to establish a trusted binding of IP addresses to switch ports. DAI will detect these forged gratuitous ARP packets and drop them. IP source guard or IPSG - Can be enabled on enterprise switches along with DHCP snooping, to prevent IP spoofing attack. 802.1X - IEEE standard for encapsulating EAP or Extensible Authentication Protocol traffic over the 802 networks. This is also called EAP over LAN or EAPOL, it was originally designed for Ethernet but support was added for other network types like Wi-Fi and fiber networks EAP-TLS - 3 parties involved.  Supplicant - Client device/software on the client that handles the authentication. E.g. wpa_supplicant in linux. Authenticator - Enterprise switch/Access point - A mediator that forwards request to authentication server Authentication Server - Usually a RADIUS server where the actual credential verification and authentication occurs.     Network Software Hardening  N/W Software hardening includes things like firewalls, proxies, VPNs, etc. Firewall - n/w based firewall or host-based firewall. Host-based in a must for portable devices like laptops. Usually both solutions are deployed. VPNs provide secure remote access and link two networks securely. Proxies can be really useful to protect client devices and their traffic. They also provide secure remote access without using a VPN. A proxy server can be configured to block content that might be malicious, dangerous, or just against company policy. A reverse proxy can be configured to allow secure remote access to web based services without requiring a VPN.    Wireless Security\n WEP Encryption and Why You Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Use It  WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy - part of the original 802.11 standard introduced back in 1997. Was intended to provide privacy on par with the wired network, which means the information passed over\nthe network should be protected from third parties eavesdropping by having physical proximity to the access point or client station. They key idea was to provide encryption so that even if someone eavesdrops, they wouldn’t be able to understand. Encryption key for each packet was computed by taking the user-supplied shared key and then joining a 24-bit initialization vector (IV). The shared key was entered as either 10 hexadecimal characters for 40-bit WEP, or 26 hex characters for 104-bit WEP. The main issue - WEP transmits both the plain text and the ciphertext in a way that exposes both of these messages to potential eavesdroppers. When plaintext and ciphertext are sent together, attackers can work out the key used for encryption. No one should be using WEP anymore it doesn’t provide the expected confidentiality or security.   Let\u0026rsquo;s Get Rid of WEP! WPA/WPA2  WPA or Wi-Fi Protected Access - A short-term replacement for WEP that would be compatible with older WEP-enabled hardware with a simple firmware update. TKIP or the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol. Introduced to overcome shortcomings of WEP security. Uses RC4 cipher. Generates unique encryption keys per packet. It also utilizes 256 bit long keys. Introduced 3 new features -  1- A more secure key derivation method was used to securely incorporate the IV into the per packet encryption key. 2- A sequence counter was implemented to prevent replay attacks by rejecting out of order packets. 3- A 64-bit MIC or Message Integrity Check was introduced to prevent forging, tampering, or corruption of packets.   Wifi passphrase is not used to encrypt traffic. The passphrase is fed into the PBKDF2 or Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2, along with the Wi-Fi networks SSID as a salt. This is then run through the HMAC-SHA1 function 4096 times to generate a unique encryption key. WPA2 improves WPA security even more by implementing CCMP or Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol. WPA2 is the best security for wireless networks currently available. It\u0026rsquo;s based on the AES cipher. Has Four-Way Handshake, since it\u0026rsquo;s made up of four exchanges of data between the client and AP. WPS - a convenience feature designed to make it easier for clients to join a WPA-PSK protected network. WPS simplifies sharing passphrases by allowing for secure exchange of the SSID and pre-shared key. This is done after authenticating or exchanging data using one of the four supported methods - PIN entry authentication, NFC or USB for out of banned exchange of the network details, or push-button authentication.   Wireless Hardening  Though 802.1X with EAP-TLS is the most secure option, it may not be viable for small companies. It requires the use of a RADIUSserver and an additional authentication back-end at a minimum. If EAP-TLS is implemented, then all the public key infrastructure components will also be necessary. You have to securely deploy PKI on the back-end for certificate management, a system must be in place to sign the client\u0026rsquo;s certificates, you have to distribute them to each client that would be authenticating to the network. If 802.1X is too complicated for a company, the next best alternative would be WPA2 with AES/CCMP mode    Network Monitoring\n Sniffing the Network  Packet Sniffing or Packet Capture, is a process of intercepting network packets in their entirety for analysis. Promiscuous mode - By default network interfaces accept and process packets that are for specific addresses. This can be overridden by configuring a special mode - Promiscuous mode which indicates \u0026ldquo;Give me all the packets.\u0026rdquo; Instead of only accepting and handling packets destined for its address, it will now accept and process any packet that it sees. This is much more useful for network analysis or monitoring purposes. Port Mirroring, allows the switch to take all packets from a specified port, port range, or the entire VLAN and mirror the packets to a specified switch port. Another option is to use Hubs. Hubs are a quick and dirty way of getting packets mirrored to your capture interface. Drawbacks - reduced throughput and the potential for introducing collisions. Monitor mode, allows us to scan across channels to see all wireless traffic being sent by APs and clients. To capture wireless traffic, all you need is an interface placed into monitor mode. Just like enabling promiscuous mode, this can be done with a simple command.   Wireshark and tcpdump  Tcpdump is a super popular, lightweight command-line based utility that you can use to capture and analyze packets. Tcpdump uses the open source libpcap library. Also supports writing packet captures to a file for later analysis, sharing, or replaying traffic. It converts key information from layers three and up into human readable formats. Output of a sample tcpdump -  1- Timestamp that represents when the packet on this line was processed by the kernel. 2- Layer-3 protocol. E.g. IPv4 3- Connection quad - source address, source port, destination address, and destination port. 4- TCP flags, TCP sequence number if there are any. 5- Ack number,TCP window size, then TCP options, if there are any. 6- Payload size in bytes.   Wireshark - another capture and analysis tool that has more features than tcpdump. It is a graphical utility that also uses the libpcap library for capture and interpretation of packets. It is more extensible when it comes to protocol and application analysis.  Can decode encrypted payloads if the encryption key is known. Can identify and extract data payloads from file transfers through protocols like SMB or HTTP     Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems  IDS/IPS systems look for matching behavior or characteristics that would indicate malicious traffic. IDS detects, IPS goes one level forward and prevents. Can either be host based or network based. NIDS systems resemble firewalls in a lot of ways. But a firewall is designed to prevent intrusions by blocking potentially malicious traffic coming from outside, and enforce ACLs between networks. NIDS systems are meant to detect and alert on potential malicious activity coming from within the network. Some popular NID or NIP systems are Snort, Suricata, and Bro NIDS    Week 5 - Defense in Depth Key Concepts\n Implement the appropriate methods for system hardening. Implement the appropriate methods for application hardening. Determine the appropriate policies to use for operating system security.  System Hardening\n Intro to Defense in Depth  Defense in depth is the concept of having multiple overlapping systems of defense to protect IT systems. This ensures some amount of redundancy for defensive measures.   Disabling Unnecessary Components  An attack vector is a method or mechanism by which an attacker or malware gains access to a network or system. Some attack vectors are email attachments, network protocols or services, network interfaces, and user input. An Attack Surface is the sum of all the different attack vectors in a given system. Think of this as the combination of all possible ways an attacker could interact with our system, regardless of known vulnerabilities. The less complex something is, the less likely there will be undetected flaws. Another way to keep things simple is to reduce your software deployments. Instead of having five different software solutions to accomplish five separate tasks, replace them with one unified solution, if you can.   Host-Based Firewall  Host-based firewalls are important to creating multiple layers of security. They protect individual hosts from being compromised when they\u0026rsquo;re used in untrusted and potentially malicious environments. They also protect individual hosts from potentially compromised peers inside a trusted network. Bastion hosts - exposed to the internet so you should pay special attention to hardening and locking them down to reduce the chances of compromise. A sort of gateway or access portal into more sensitive services like core authentication servers or domain controllers.   Logging and Auditing  Logging is very crucial. A firewall would log traffic that matches rules with details like source and destination addresses, and ports being used Security information and event management systems or SIEMS - centralized logging server Some examples of logging servers and SIEMS solutions are the open source rsylog, Splunk Enterprise Security, IBM Security Qradar, and RSA Security analytics.   Antimalware Protection  Antivirus software is signature based. This means that it has a database of signatures that identify known malware like the unique file hash of a malicious binary or the file associated with an infection. Or it could be that network traffic characteristics that malware uses to communicate with a command and control server. There are two issues with antivirus software though. The first is that they depend on antivirus signatures distributed by the antivirus software vendor. The second is that they depend on the antivirus vendor discovering new malware and writing new signatures for newly discovered threats.   Disk Encryption  Full-disk encryption, or FDE, is an important factor in a defense in-depth security model. It provides protection from some physical forms of attack There are first-party full-disk encryption solutions from Microsoft and Apple called Bit Locker and FileVault 2 respectively. There are also a bunch of third party and open source solutions. On Linux, the dm-crypt package is super popular. There are also solutions from PGP, TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt, and lots of others.    Application Hardening\n Software Patch Management  A lot of attacks depend on exploiting bugs in software. This triggers obscure and unintended behavior which can lead to a compromise of the system running the vulnerable software. Can be fixed through software patches and updates which correct the bugs Solutions like Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s SCCM or Puppet Labs puppet in fact and tools allow administrators to get an overview of what software is installed across their fleet of many systems   Application Policies  Application software can represent a pretty large attack surface. So it is important to have some kind of application policies in place. Policies define boundaries of what applications are permitted or not, they also help educate folks on how to use software more securely    Week 6 - Creating a Company Culture for Security Key Concepts\n Determine appropriate measures to use to meet the 3 goals of security. Develop a security plan for a small-medium size organization. Develop a disaster recovery plan.  Risk in the Workplace\n Security Goals  Before you start to design a security architecture, you need to define exactly what you like it to accomplish, which differs from company to company. If the company handles credit card payments, then you have to follow the PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard depending. 6 broad objectives of PCI DSS (An area that I\u0026rsquo;m super familiar with!)  Build and maintain a secure network and systems  Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data Not use vendor supply default for system passwords/other parameters   Protect cardholder data  Protect stored cardholder data - encrypt data at rest, have data retention policies to make sure that sensitive payment information isn\u0026rsquo;t stored beyond the time it\u0026rsquo;s required Encrypt the transmission of cardholder data across open public networks   Maintain a vulnerability management program  Protect all systems against malware and regularly update antivirus software or programs Develop and maintain secure systems and applications   Implement strong access control measures  Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know Identify and authenticate access to system components Restrict physical access to cardholder data   Regularly monitor and test networks  Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data Regularly test security systems and processes   Maintain an information security policy  Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel (security team + users)       Measuring and Assessing Risk  Security is about determining risks and understanding the likelihood of attacks; and designing defenses around these risks to minimize the impact of an attack Threat modeling - Identify likely threats to our systems, then we assign them priorities that correspond to severity and probability   Privacy Policy  Users\n User Habits  One needs to set up users for success so that they don\u0026rsquo;t develop habits that might prove harmful. For e.g. If long and complex passwords are enforced as a rule, users might end up writing them on a post-it to remember and that defeats the purpose. If sharing big files is a common behavior, there needs to be a solution for that within the company so that users don’t end up using a 3rd party. Password reuse is another common user behavior and one needs to encourage users to choose unique passwords for different systems.   Third-Party Security  When you contract services from a third party, you\u0026rsquo;re trusting them to protect your data and any credentials involved. Conduct a vendor risk review or security assessment. If possible, ask the third party security assessment report. Google recently made their vendor security assessment questionnaires available for free.   Security Training  It\u0026rsquo;s impossible to have good security practices at your company if employees and users haven\u0026rsquo;t received good trainings and resources.    Incident Handling\n Incident Reporting and Analysis  The very first step of handling an incident is to detect it in the first place. It could be through IDS system or some other alerting. Or someone bringing to your notice. The next step is to analyze it and determine the effects and scope of damage. The next step is containment. You need to contain the breach to prevent further damage   Incident Response and Recovery  Once a threat has been detected and contained, it has to be removed or remediated. For malware infection, this means removing the malware from affected systems. In many other cases, removal may not be possible, the affected system might have to be restored to a known good configuration. It is crucial to avoid complications or to not add to the problem. Sometimes shutdown works but many times, it could cause more damage.   Mobile Security and Privacy  One of the most basic protections you can enable on a smartphone or tablet is a screen lock. Enable storage encryption on the device if it is not default. Watch what permission is given to each app on the phone.

Everything seems to be falling apart. Shipments are always late, backlog is growing, factory is bleeding money though every single person is working hard all the time. The VP comes to the factory and asks about an order that is seven-weeks overdue. He goes into the factory floor and asks folks to stop everything and work on the order that he wants to be done. He yells at the machinist and he quits. The VP tells the manager that the order has to go out today no matter the cost. Also that the factory is running so badly that it will be shut down in 3 months. The manager goes on the floor and finds out that the machinist who quit earlier, is crucial to get the work done fast! To add to all this, his wife is completely upset with him since he is mostly at office and does not give enough time to the family. Tonight he was supposed to take his wife out and it turns out to be an allnighter to deliver an order that VP has asked for. Phew!\nIf anyone thinks that this is a far fetched scenario, I assure you that it is not. It is a day-to-day reality at most of the tech companies, especially the ones on the cutting edge, not to mention Startups. As someone who worked at online companies for the last 15 years, close to a decade at ebay and six years at PayPal, this situation is all too familiar to me. Of course, it depends on the team and role but an online company is 24/7 and unanticipated issues can happen anytime. With SRE on your back and a lot of people asking questions, you could hear the collective heartbeat of the executive team and also\nthe sound of money going down the drain, when there is a production P0 at hand. Impacting the livelihood of merchants is another thing that would spring you to action.\nBut the story is not a sombre one. Alex, the plant manager is able to get out of the trouble. He makes a remarkable turnaround and posts profits every month and delivers orders ahead of time. He also wins back the love of his wife and gets time to spend with his kids.\nAll because he gets a chance to present his problem to his professor in the past and the professor, a wise man, asks a series of great questions. The questions get Alex thinking and he finds solutions by working with his team. The key inputs are the questions raised by the \u0026lsquo;Yoda\u0026rsquo; professor, Jonah.\nWhen one is close to the \u0026lsquo;factory\u0026rsquo;, one tends to dismiss theoretical scientists as moutain-top hermits who are not close to code and don\u0026rsquo;t know the realities. But the book proves that for critical thinking, one doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be working at the lathe, one could as well be outside and observe the workings to analyze what is wrong. This is what Jonah does.\nThe biggest takeaway from the book was that one needs to be clear about what the Goal is. The goal of a company is to make money. Increase throughput, reduce inventory and reduce the operation expenses. Look at the whole operation and find out bottlenecks, reduce bottlenecks to improve throughput. The key thing is to sell quality products which could translate in software terms to \u0026lsquo;ship code\u0026rsquo;.\nPlanning makes all the difference. The team is able to deliver a sudden order of 1000 parts without overworking or spending time in the weekends because they do things in a methodical manner.\nOverall, it is a great book and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad that someone recommended this to me. For new managers, it might help them be better managers, for existing managers who are finding it tough to juggle all the balls in the air, it would offer hope - to think, to look for new solutions, and be optimistic. The best thing is, it is a business book that is written as a story, a thriller, where you\u0026rsquo;re turning the next page to find out what happened!\nThe Goal on Amazon - The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement\n","description":"","id":19,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement by Eliyahu M.

We were best friends in school and I had lost touch with him during engineering. One day there was an email and he said he was in Chennai. We agreed to meet. It was either a Saturday or a Sunday. I used to teach Math for CAT students during the weekends. I had finished a class and met RR at Landmark (book shop) in a mall. It probably was Spencer\u0026rsquo;s but not fully sure. He gifted me this book and it was a great surprise. He used to give greeting cards in the past with some inspiring and soulful words written beautifully. Expecting him to have written something, I opened the book to find a quote among other wishes.\n\u0026ldquo;Obstacles are things you see when you take your eyes off the goal.\u0026rdquo; ~ Henry Ford\nNow that I think of it, Dostoyevsky was an author who I wanted to read but hadn\u0026rsquo;t read. My first introduction to Dostoyevsky happened probably during high school/PU days. Through a book named Oru Sangeerthanam Pole (Like a Psalm) by Perumbadavam. I think I read the book from Viveknagar library. The author called Dostoyevsky as Hridayathinu mel dhaivathinte kayyoppulla aal (A man who has God\u0026rsquo;s signature on his heart).\nI used to visit Viveknagar library often. It was a small government library which was close to the bus stand. It used to open in the morning, close in the afternoon and open in the evening around 5. Many times, I used to wait for the libarian to come. There were few other people also waiting, usually to read newspaper or magazines. Since it was a govt library, there were books in all languages - many in Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, etc. I had read most of the English books that were available. Moreover our school had a bigger library with lot more choices. There was a small section of Malayalam books - probably around 20-30 books. I\u0026rsquo;d read a few of them in the library. Kanam and Parappurath are two authors I remember. I had heard of Dostoyevsky for the first time from one of the books I read during this time.\nOru Sangeerthanam Pole is about Dostoyevsky\u0026rsquo;s relationship with Anna, his stenographer. It describes him as a person anyone would hate. He was a drunkard, gambler, lonely and depressed. He has a deadline to write a novel but had not started even a single page. I was thinking that someone like him may not make it anywhere in India. The society, in general is very intolerant of people who drink.\nThe connection between Russia and Kerala itself is something to think about. How did Communism make its way to Kerala? How is there a Communist party which is Leninist. Saw a movie couple of years back called Comrade In America (CIA) where the protagonist has a chat with Che Guvera, Marx and Lenin during a difficult time. Anyway, the Russia connection is something to read about for a later time.\nI feel like I need to read Oru Sangeerthanam Pole and Crime and Punishment again. Last year I read a book named 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson. Peterson refers to Dostoyevsky multiple times in his book. Of course, he talks more about Solzhenitsyn\u0026rsquo;s Gulag Archipelago but he was a big fan of Dostoyevsky and urges us to read his books.\nPhoto of the quote\n","description":"","id":21,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Like a Psalm - Remembering Dostoyevsky","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-07-like-a-psalm/"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.\u0026quot;\n~ Emerson\n Had a dream about me being in Chennai and being asked about a book that I was reading. I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember who it was, but it was someone happy to see me with a book. That set me thinking.\nIt is great to be in this phase of life where I\u0026rsquo;m getting time to read and also, write a bit. I hope it lasts. Usually, when things are running smoothly, something happens that throws everything upside down and before long, years would have passed by. Anyway, it feels good to sit back and reminisce.\nChennai Days I was in Chennai for less than two years in my life, but from a reading standpoint, it was a tremendous period. Was lucky to be in the same team with 4 people I now refer to as \u0026ldquo;the philosopher quartet\u0026rdquo; - JC, MS, AH, and VS. They were well-read and used to discuss books often. VS was a real poet who penned poems in Tamil. Was introduced to Kant, Nietzsche, J Krishnamoorthi, Bertrand Russel, and many authors during this period just by listening to them chat with each other. I believe that it was a stroke of luck that I was even placed in that team as my first job. Specific books that I recall right now are Robert Persig\u0026rsquo;s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Hemingway\u0026rsquo;s Old Man and the Sea recommended by MS, Arthur C Clark \u0026amp; Isaac Asimov novels by AH and Who moved my Cheese and a few other business books by JC. AH gave me Arthur C. Clark\u0026rsquo;s Rama II as a gift when I left Chennai.\nOther groups of friends were folks outside my team - few people who were in my class during the 3 month orientation where we were given a crash course of CS topics, my roommates, and friends of these people. I developed great admiration for people from TKM and CUSAT (engg colleges in Kerala) due to the interaction with these folks. PS was in my class and was a big Harry Potter fan. She had forwarded a pdf/text of the first book, and I had liked the book a lot. AN was my junior and was from Bangalore. As Bangaloreans were \u0026lsquo;foreigners\u0026rsquo; in Chennai, I used to connect with b\u0026rsquo;lore folks just to chat. He was a big fan of The Lord of The Rings. When we used to meet in the hallways of Elnet/Tidel, he would talk at length about the story and it was pretty entertaining. I\u0026rsquo;d credit PS and AN for my interest in fantasy novels.\nAnother great influence on my reading during that time was DT. She was PS\u0026rsquo;s friend and also was in my roommate RV\u0026rsquo;s team, I think. She was a great fan of English classics. I think I read most of Thomas Hardy\u0026rsquo;s novels during this period: The Return of the Native, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Far from the Madding Crowd, Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Under the Greenwood Tree. Also remember reading George Eliot - The Mill on the Floss \u0026amp; Silas Marner. I think I read Adam Bede after I came to the US. Her favorite books were Louisa May Alcott\u0026rsquo;s Little Women and Three Men in a boat by Jerome K Jerome. She introduced me to Somerset Maugham and AJ Cronin. Maugham\u0026rsquo;s Of Human Bondage and Cronin\u0026rsquo;s The Keys of the Kingdom were great reads. I read Keys of the Kingdom at a time when I was contemplating becoming a priest. My goal was to work for a few years, get some personal things taken care of, and get into seminary. I did research a few places but wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to get into. Also was waiting for a \u0026lsquo;sign\u0026rsquo; that never came! Erich Segal\u0026rsquo;s Doctors was another of DTs recommendations. Dan Brown\u0026rsquo;s The Da Vinci Code and Leon Uris were my roommate RV\u0026rsquo;s recommendations. VV was another close friend of mine and he was a big fan of Thoreau. He used to speak at length about Walden.\nWell, at the outset, it seems like I read only the books from people\u0026rsquo;s recommendations. That is true for the first books of many authors. But usually ended up reading more from the same authors and also did pay it forward by recommending the same with new folks that I met along the way.\nNow that I think of it, I probably could go back to my earliest memories to see what I read when. Most of the books that I\u0026rsquo;ve read have some person or incident attached to it. It is the question of remembering.\nPrimary School One of the first novels I remember reading is The Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. I got this book as a prize for getting the first rank in 5th std. I remember reading the whole book but not understanding it much. I probably read a few times without understanding, I think. I actually understood the story only after I read an abridged version. Another book that I remember reading during that time is Oliver Twist. My mother probably had to study some of Dickens\u0026rsquo; stories in school. She had a high regard for Dickens and her advise was that I stick to reading only biographies or stories by Dickens, and so wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite happy that I was reading a lot of fiction in high school.\nI do remember reading a lot of Tinkle, Amar Chitra Katha during this time. Probably got them from Krishna or Joe or other friends in the neighborhood. Read Balarama and Balamangalam, mostly with Biju. My uncle had a lot of books in Kerala, and when we visited during summer holidays, I used to spend a lot of time reading. Remember reading Ithihyamala (Garland of legends/myths), Greek Purana Kathasagaram (Greek Ancient Stories), and 1001 Arabian Nights. Got really interested in mythology - Indian as well as Greek during this time. Almost all of my mythology reading, in the initial days, were in Malayalam. Can\u0026rsquo;t believe that I read the stories of Zeus, Ulysses, Achilles, etc. first time in Malayalam.\nAnother group of my readings during primary \u0026amp; high school days were novels from Malayala Manorama weekly. Used to read it stealthily most of the time, though. Josy Vagamattom, Joisy, Ettumanoor Sivakumar, Kottayam Pushpanath were my favorite authors. At least the ones that I remember now after 20 odd years. It used to be serialized, in which only a part of the story would be published every week and most of them always ended on a cliff-hanger at the end. One was left waiting for next Wednesday to come! Josy Vagamattom wrote thrillers which had many fights - I remember Dravidan and a hero named Noble. Not sure if Noble was the hero in Dravidan or it was someone else. Joisy wrote poignant family dramas - I remember Ila pozhiyum shishiram in which a man comes back home from Gulf war after 5 years in captivity and finds that his wife had married his best friend. Ettumanoor Sivakumar was a writer of horror stories that had manthravadam (magic), yakshi (lady vampire), powerful munis and what not! Kottayam Pushpanath wrote detective stories that had a lot of twist and turns.\nHigh School High school was a different world than what I was exposed to till that point. Most kids were reading Hardy Boys, Secret Seven, Asterix, and a few other books and comics that I\u0026rsquo;d never heard of. In terms of reading volume, I probably read the maximum during that time. Definitely more than 250 books. Just the Hardy Boys books were probably over 50, may be 100. Read most books of Agatha Christie, Jeffrey Archer, Sidney Sheldon, Robert Ludlum, Harold Robbins, Alistair MacLean, Jack Higgins, Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason) and so on. I think I was mostly reading Hardy boys in the 8th std. and suddenly jumped to reading Wilbur Smith, Harold Robbins, Jack Higgins, etc. in the 9th. Sometimes I read a book a day and rushed through them so fast that I barely remembered anything other than the main plot points. We were also going through a tough time personally and the books were probably a good escape too. All the reading meant that I didn\u0026rsquo;t study as much as I did during primary school. From someone who used to be upset with anything less than 100/100 in primary school and used to check with my teachers when I got less marks, even half a percent less, I became ok with just getting 90% in high school. But it was also a good transition from memorizing every single word in a text book to understanding high level ideas from books. Jeffrey Archer\u0026rsquo;s Kane and Abel, Sydney Sheldon\u0026rsquo;s Rage of Angels, Alistair MacLean\u0026rsquo;s Guns of Navarone, Robert Ludlum\u0026rsquo;s Bourne series, were some of the best page turners that I\u0026rsquo;ve read, then and now. RR was a looming influence and like a guru to me throughout high school. A lot of the books that I read were books that he had read though he was far ahead in terms of vocabulary and comprehending difficult texts. Robert Ludlum and Jeffrey Archer were probably his favorites and mine too. The idea of starting with one of an author and reading through all of his/her books came during this time, I think.\nEngineering When I think of Engineering days, one book that stands out is Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I can\u0026rsquo;t recollect how I got the book. It was most probably from Viveknagar library. The curious thing is that the cover and the first couple of pages were not there. The torn book started with \u0026lsquo;Part 1 - Non-Contradiction\u0026rsquo; and I thought the name of the book was \u0026lsquo;Non-Contradiction\u0026rsquo;! As I was studying during the day and taking tuitions for neighborhood kids in the evening and doing homework in the night. So there was not much time to read, but somehow did manage to read.\nI did read many English Classics during the time. Became a member of British Library with RA\u0026rsquo;s help and we used to visit the library many times. Re-read a few Agatha Christie books, a few Shakespeare books (not the plays but abridged versions which were written as stories). Discovered Antony Trollope while randomly surfing through books. I read a few of his books, but don\u0026rsquo;t remember any at the moment. I\u0026rsquo;d read A Tale of Two Cities in the past but read that again and found it to be the best book I\u0026rsquo;d ever read.\nAlso used to visit the Central library in Cubbon Park during those days. It was very close to UVCE and was the biggest library I had seen in my life. It probably is the largest library in the State even now. I was awestruck with the size every time I visited it. We had a very good library in the College but this was something else. Used to bunk some classes and sit in the library. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t (probably even now) very good at being an audience. Every time I\u0026rsquo;m in a hall or a room listening to someone talking on a stage, I would doze of in a few minutes. Happened during most of the classes except for those where we had to do something. So, I was studying everything on my own, anyway. Remember reading books on Kerala history from the library. Didn\u0026rsquo;t know that Malayalam was a young language and evolved as a result of combination of Tamil and Sanskrit. Also read more about our Church history, Christianity in Kerala, etc. Got a better understanding of Orthodoxy and the beginning of Christianity in Kerala in 52 AD when St. Thomas came. I think the average Orthodox Christian in Kerala knows history quite well due to our faction fight with the Syrian Patriarch. The \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; fight has resulted in more awareness, otherwise, numbers could have gone down in every generation, with more of the diaspora moving on to new philosophies or identities.\nA Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking was a book that SN had read and I read it based on his recommendation. We used to have a lot of chat around space time and our place in the world itself. He was a follower of Ramanujacharya\u0026rsquo;s Dwaita philosophy. There are definitely many more books that I don\u0026rsquo;t recollect right now.\nWorking Days - India When CTS recruited us from Campus during 5th semester, there was a hope that the Bangalore office would become big enough. But 9-11 struck and we had to go to Chennai. Couple of years of work in Chennai and then a year or so in Bangalore were great in terms of reading. I already mentioned about Chennai days above. When I rewrite this piece, I\u0026rsquo;d probably write it in a chronological order. In B\u0026rsquo;lore, I read a few business and leadership books recommended by AN who was from IIM-A and was super wise. I was lucky that he was sitting next to me since he was not even in our team. AN and GG used to solve the crossword puzzle on the Hindu every day morning. I remember not being able to solve even one in the initial days and then slowly getting a hang of it and really loving it.\nWorking Days - US A lot of my time in the US has been this cloud of time where I did nothing other than work. Get up in the morning and immediately check if there were some issues or emails from APAC, work late in the night to deliver projects that had very tough deadlines, etc. In reality, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t like that every day but it seems like that. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been nostalgic about my time in India and it has always felt like there was no time.\nBut when I look back at the last decade, I have read many books. Most of my Software Engineering related reading happened in the last 15 years. Reminds me to create a section for Software / Computer Science related books in the Reading List\nI remember reading a lot of poetry in the first couple of years. Was still in touch with friends from Chennai and Bangalore and we used to exchange poems even during Chennai days. Was even writing poems during that time. Emily Dickinson and Elizabeth Browning were my favorite poets I think. Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s sonnets were a great read. So were other poets like William Blake, Rudyard Kipling, HW Longfellow, John Donne, Tennyson, Rumi.\nLongfellow\u0026rsquo;s The Arrow and The Song, Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s Sonnet 18 (Shall I compare thee to a summer\u0026rsquo;s day), Sonnet 116 (Let me not to the marriage of true minds), John Donne\u0026rsquo;s No Man is an Island, Robert Frost\u0026rsquo;s Stopping by the woods, The Road not taken, and Mending Wall (Good fences make good neighbors), Kipling\u0026rsquo;s If, Elizabeth Browning\u0026rsquo;s How do I Love Thee, W.E Henley\u0026rsquo;s Invictus, William Blake\u0026rsquo;s The Poison Tree, Wordsworth\u0026rsquo;s I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud, Konstantinos Kavafis\u0026rsquo;s Ithaca are poems that I\u0026rsquo;d recommend to anyone.\nIn 2007, AK, my wife, and I wrote a book of poems and called it Sycamore Tree. It might have had around 20-25 poems. Not published though. AK has gone ahead and written over 100 poems by now.\nAK is a more prolific reader than I am, and I\u0026rsquo;ve read many books after she has read them. Susan Cain\u0026rsquo;s Quiet comes to mind. She loves classics too. She has probably read Jane Eyre five-six times. I read Of Love and Other Demons by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Dear Life by Alice Munro, and a few other books from her list.\nOne of my neighbors suggested reading Jonathan Stroud and I loved the three books in The Bartimaeus Trilogy - The Amulet of Samarkand, The Golem\u0026rsquo;s Eye and Ptolemy\u0026rsquo;s Gate. Read Lockwood \u0026amp; Co.: The Screaming Staircase while on a trip to Denver a few years back. It was a great experience. Took me back to the early days of reading Hardy Boys!\nA colleague had recommended Neal Stephenson\u0026rsquo;s Snow Crash. Was astounded by that. Stephenson had pretty much predicted a lot of things way back in the 90s. Need to read more of Stephenson.\nLast two years were good in terms of being exposed to reading and books. MT runs an \u0026lsquo;Authors Series\u0026rsquo; in the campus where Authors of books come and talk about their books. Just attending them and getting a gist of the books were great time spent. I have all those books in my bookshelf waiting to be read.\nNote - I will probably come back update this since more memories may come back in the future.\n","description":"","id":22,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"My Reading Journey","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/"},{"content":"Intro Wanted to create an API spec for brainstorming an API that we\u0026rsquo;re developing. Swagger is probably the most popular API design tool. I had used Apiary (https://apiary.io/) in the past (2013-14). It had features like defining the API spec using yaml and it getting rendered beautifully as API documentation. Nothing like a great API documentation that shows different methods, parameters, objects, input/output status codes and even a server/sandbox to try it out. It makes the life easier for consumers of the API. Currently a lot of companies use tools like Swagger, and the API documentation is quite good. The struggle to understand an API and get help to consume it is a thing of the past. API design is probably one of the most impactful aspects of software development since the right design goes a long way to lay the foundation of a solid system that works great for the service provider as well as clients.\nGreat API documentation examples The model API documentation to follow are probably the following -\n Plaid - https://plaid.com/docs/ Stripe - https://stripe.com/docs/api Twitter - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index Github - https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/  Back to Swagger, here is a quick explanation of Swagger from their website -\nWhat Is Swagger? From https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/what-is-swagger/\n Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger. Why is it so great? Well, by reading your API’s structure, we can automatically build beautiful and interactive API documentation. We can also automatically generate client libraries for your API in many languages and explore other possibilities like automated testing. Swagger does this by asking your API to return a YAML or JSON that contains a detailed description of your entire API. This file is essentially a resource listing of your API which adheres to OpenAPI Specification.\n  The specification asks you to include information like:\n  What are all the operations that your API supports? What are your API’s parameters and what does it return? Does your API need some authorization? And even fun things like terms, contact information and license to use the API.  Installing Swagger editor locally There are two options to use the Swagger editor (https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/). You can download the editor or use the cloud version, which is the \u0026lsquo;Swagger Hub\u0026rsquo;. Wanted to try the cloud version since there would be no setup needed for it. It asked for sign-up or creating the account using Github. Did that and then thought it may not be a good idea to use the web. Might be better to install it locally and run. So went back to the editor page and clicked on \u0026lsquo;download Swagger Editor\u0026rsquo;. That took me to the swagger github repository (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor). Was expecting a binary that I could use to install locally though.\nAnyway, did a git clone and followed the instructions to set it up locally.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  # Install npm packages (if needed) npm install # Build the app npm run build # Build an image docker build -t swagger-editor . # Run the container docker run -d -p 80:8080 swagger-editor   But this failed with the error\ndocker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?\nSo installed docker. Used the local installable \u0026lsquo;Docker Desptop for Mac\u0026rsquo;(https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). This had a getting-started example which was easy to follow and in a few steps was able to create a \u0026lsquo;getting-started\u0026rsquo; container. The dashboard had a pretty UI to display the container. One could start/stop the container using the UI.\nUsing the swagger-editor docker image Another option mentioned in the Swagger repo was to use a docker image that was already published in DockerHub. Should have used that instead of trying to build this locally.\ndocker pull swaggerapi/swagger-editor docker run -d -p 80:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-editor Navigating to http://localhost showed the beautiful Swagger UI with a pre-filled \u0026ldquo;Petstore API documentation\u0026rdquo;.\nExciting! Now starts the actual API documentation.\n","description":"","id":23,"section":"tech-notes","tags":null,"title":"API documentation using Swagger","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/tech-notes/2020-06-04-api-documentation/"},{"content":"Thankfully most of the demonstrations across the U.S. today were peaceful. There was one in San Ramon also where people marched from our local Safeway (Gale Ranch) to City Hall near Bishop Ranch.\nBut the wound is deep. The anguish and heartbreak will not go away. Anyone who has seen the videos cannot remain not being horrified and scared.\nGeorge Floyd has unwittingly become the catalyst for change that is imminent. He has become a symbol of a person who was set up for failure. Whatever he did or said could not have saved him. I was reminded of Tom Robinson from \u0026ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird\u0026rdquo;. Mayella comes on to him, but he gets accused of rape. Atticus proves that Tom could not have hit her on her right cheek since his left hand was injured. But the jury convicts Tom and sentences him for execution. The hopelessness of knowing that once you\u0026rsquo;re caught in the crosshairs of one or more prejudiced people, there is no escape. This once incident made people sit back and think about thousands of small instances where bigotry and prejudice won.\nIs there a solution? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t this happen everywhere in the world? In many ways, big and small, humans are hurting each other and it feels sad. Aren\u0026rsquo;t all the 7+ billion people in the world part of the same species who are similar 99.9% to each other?

So is the author hinting at \u0026ldquo;more supply than demand\u0026rdquo;?\nBut a New York Times article and many such suggest that there are millions of jobs being unfilled.\n A stunning statistic is reverberating in cybersecurity: An estimated 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs will be available but unfilled by 2021. [2]\n I think that as more people adopt to digital life, either due to COVID-19 or due to other reasons, cybersecurity becomes center stage. Take Zoom, for example. As more people started using the software, few security and privacy issues were found. \u0026lsquo;Zoombombing\u0026rsquo; became a new buzzword where people were sharing instances of strangers joining their calls. So, though the recent slump may weed out some startups, there are surely many more on the horizon. The times we live in, demands it.\nIn another article, a security researcher claimed 100K for exposing a vulnerability with apple sign-in [3]. Wow! But I was immediately thinking of the engineers on the other side. Zero-day vulnerabilities (A type of vulnerability that is not known to the software dev or vendor but to the attacker), are the worst. Companies pour money into bug bounty programs to find these. As someone who managed a sensitive application, I have been on the other side. It is like standing on a needle where every second is valuable, and it\u0026rsquo;s a race to resolve it before anyone else finds out. It is AHOD, you gather the most important folks, don\u0026rsquo;t talk about it to anyone during the issue resolution and once it\u0026rsquo;s done, you forget about it.\nThat reminds me to start writing notes about \u0026lsquo;Life After Google\u0026rsquo; [4]. Gilder does list a few items that he thinks should be the cornerstone of a new blockchain-based system. Here are the 7 principles of \u0026lsquo;The Blockstack movement\u0026rsquo;, as mentioned in the book.\n 1. Distributed cadastre: Assures security through logical centralization\n  2. Maximum scalability: Assures performance and scalability by separating the control plane from the data plane.\n  3. Single prototype: Establishes property rights by upholding the principle and precedence of singular documents, time-stamped, recorded, and algorithmically allocated.\n  4. Parallel complement: Its expansion confers benefits of privacy and property on its participants without directly threatening incumbents.\n  5. Low-entropy carrier: Provides a stable, predictable, and monolithic foundation for the high-entropy metaverse on the edge.\n  6. Free migration: It allows unobstructed passage from one blockchain or network to another without locking in users.\n  7. End-to-end, trust-to-trust: All nodes rest on roots of trust that are not heavily dependent on outside authorities.\n I don\u0026rsquo;t know enough to be able to talk much about these things yet, but would definitely be interested in knowing more about #3 - Single prototype.\n[1] Rundle, James. “Cybersecurity Startups Feel a Pinch on Funding and Sales.” The Wall Street Journal.

In 2017, my professor at SJSU asked me to write a paper on IoT Security and Machine Learning techniques used to protect IoT systems. That was really interesting. Learnt about IoT, Fog Computing, Privacy and Security issues with IoT systems during that time. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent a few hours on the weekends on this topic, did a Coursera course, some readings as part of SCW (Secure Code Warrior) and beat CTF competitions. I was even thinking of enrolling in the Cybersecurity Bootcamp at Berkeley. But there was never time. There was always a burning issue in the to-do list that was past due.\nWhat if there is a question about continuing in the same domain and possibly growing to a higher position or trying to learn something new? I could divide my 18+ years of experience after B.E. graduation as\n 8 years of Payments (6 yrs at PayPal, 2 years at ebay PGW/Billing, few months with a Gas Station CC Transaction Processing system) 8 years of e-commerce (at ebay) a couple of years in misc domains (Healthcare, Insurance).  If you had a finite number of working years, say 40, would you pack it with one domain or multiple? The answer probably is different for different people. Of course, a domain like Payments is a mansion with a lot of rooms. A lifetime is not enough to cover all the payment processing schemes and rails. But for a Computer Scientist, a domain is another problem space that needs the right software tools.\nSomeone in the past had asked me to do this Thought Experiment when confronted with the question of this or that - \u0026ldquo;If you had all the money that you wanted, what would you do?\u0026rdquo;. In this case, I would definitely say, time to learn something new. I think the idea of learning something new or doing the same thing in a new way, appeals to people at a fundamental level. In small or big ways, everyone is an inventor. Invention is at the heart of being human.\nThough knowledge wins hands down, most of the time, the biggest inertia for a job change is always the people. The people you work with have become your friends and like extended family, especially if you\u0026rsquo;ve pulled off a project or two that had extremely tough deadlines, debugged several hairy bugs together or brainstormed and argued about the design of new systems, etc. It is the people that make work enjoyable, they are the loved ones that have your back.

RV mentioned that I might need to learn Go if I need to tryout some HyperLedger frameworks in the future. Go has a cool playground to try things online and a tour which teaches you basics.\nRather than looking at them, I wanted to look at some actual code and infer how things work. Most of the people in the Software industry learn things that way anyway. You take up a new project or a join a new team and the first thing that you do is to setup the codebase and figure your way around. In the past (say a decade back), setting up someone\u0026rsquo;s codebase was the toughest thing. The first setup never worked and you had to actually get a help from one of the past developers to set some esoteric environment variable or have a specific folder structure or have specific versions of Java or some special dependencies. Maven simplified a lot of these dependency issues but still it was a struggle. But fast-forward to 2020, most repos have instructions on how to setup and they are pretty straight forward to setup even if there are no instructions.\nThough I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a lot of front-end applications over the years, my expertise has been backend services. So why not look at how to develop a simple REST API using golang? Was thinking of loading a small dataset like \u0026lsquo;Books data\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Iris data\u0026rsquo;.\nInstalling Go Installed Go from the golang website. https://golang.org/dl/.\nChecked if it was installed.\ngo version I got the response back as go version go1.14.3 darwin/amd64\nSample Codebase Searched github.com and got the following go repos for \u0026ldquo;bookdata\u0026rdquo;. Looks like people are using this to learn Go.\n       The first application seems to be pretty good. It even has documentation on the API paths that are supported.\nSetting up sample codebase git clone https://github.com/moficodes/bookdata-api.git I was assuming, and hoping that there should be no other setup that is needed.\nStarting the server cd bookdata-api go run . Testing the API The documentation has the following REST APIs.\nAll api endpoints are prefixed with /api/v1\nGet Books by Author \u0026quot;/books/authors/{author}\u0026quot; Optional query parameter for ratingAbove ratingBelow limit and skip Get Books by BookName \u0026quot;/books/book-name/{bookName}\u0026quot; Optional query parameter for ratingAbove ratingBelow limit and skip Get Book by ISBN \u0026quot;/book/isbn/{isbn}\u0026quot; Delete Book by ISBN \u0026quot;/book/isbn/{isbn}\u0026quot; Create New Book \u0026quot;/book\u0026quot; Looking at the dataset in ./assets/books.csv, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if Author\u0026rsquo;s names with spaces would work.\nThe first line in the dataset was this -\n1,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), J.K. Rowling-Mary GrandPré,4.56,0439785960,9780439785969,eng,652,1944099,26249 Decided to open up Postman and do a search using ISBN.\nGET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/book/isbn/0439785960 voila!\nI was super surprised that it even worked the first time. Exciting stuff. Thanks to moficodes for creating this app and sharing it on github.\nInspecting the codebase Many people think that reading through a codebase written in a language that you don\u0026rsquo;t yet know, would not be possible. Definitely not! Programming languages are not like human languages. It is usually easy to figure out the simple stuff since the same patterns repeat everywhere, especially if you have been coding or reading code for sometime. Of course, the difficult stuff is not easy. Reading through a complex codebase might take time even if you have a decade or two of coding experience.\nThe codebase here seems quite simple enough.\n  server.go -\u0026gt; Has a main function with all the API paths defined.\n  routes.go -\u0026gt; Has the functions called in server.go like \u0026lsquo;searchByAuthor\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;searchByISBN\u0026rsquo;, etc.\n  loader.go in \u0026lsquo;loader\u0026rsquo; folder -\u0026gt; Has the definition of BookData data structure and a function to load the data.\nI\u0026rsquo;d assume that this gets invoked during the server start.\n  memory.go -\u0026gt; Has initialize method which has code to load data from a file.\n  There is no correlation between the filename and the classname as in Java. A file contains a package statement, similar to Java, import statement which has packages to be imported. The syntax for import is different but you get what it is trying to do.

The steps are simple enough to write a script and have a cron job execute it.\nThe steps from the post on Setting up hugo site and publishing to github are below\ncd \u0026lt;site directory\u0026gt; hugo cd \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Regenerate Site\u0026quot; git push The process is pretty simple.

Put the plist file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, load and start the job.  Defining the Job First step in this is to create a script that you can run.\nI created gitpush.sh that could execute all the steps above. One thing that didn\u0026rsquo;t work was hugo command.

I bought the book back in 2013 but haven\u0026rsquo;t read it yet.\nI still remember the first time I saw a trailer for the movie Cloud Atlas and being amazed and speechless. It was probably one of the best trailers I\u0026rsquo;d seen and the concept of interwoven lives and people being connected across generations really appealed to me.

That made me think if I should explore moving from Jekyll to something newer. New frameworks keep coming up and it probably is a good idea to shift to keep up. So googled for static website generators to see comparisons to products similar to Jekyll. Found that there are many. Hugo caught my attention and I had wanted to migrate my site to Hugo since then. All that was needed was couple of hours or so but I think I probably spent more time exploring through Hugo Themes for many days and months. My initial thought was to have a theme similar to the one that I had with Jekyll, which was the Clean  theme. What I had liked the most about the theme was the font, especially the italics version. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t like banner images. Thinking of choosing the right image for an article itself seemed like a chore. I\u0026rsquo;d rather prefer just typing text. My first choice was to go with a theme called Even. It didn\u0026rsquo;t quite workout the way I intended it to. I wanted to have a left-nav and also a starting page which was not a list of blog entries. After a couple of tries, used a theme called Anatole. It was super simple to set up and modify.\nSetting up the Hugo Site The steps to set up are pretty simple like Jekyll. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s Quick Start page covers the basics very clearly. I\u0026rsquo;ll review what I did in addition to setting up the Hugo site.\n1. Install hugo \u0026amp; Create a new site The first step is to install hugo. It is pretty simple on the Mac if you already have brew installed. Installation steps for other OSs are in the hugo-install site.\nbrew install hugo You can use hugo version to check if the insallation was done.\nhugo new site rr_site It is that simple. This creates a new site with all the default code that is needed. You can start the server by hugo server -D but it would be an empty site. In this step it differs from Jekyll where you get a ready made site right away. In order to view something meaningful, you need to configure your site with a theme.\n2. Configure the site with a theme cd rr_site git init git submodule add https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole.git themes/anatole cp themes/anatole/exampleSite/config.toml . This steps assumes that you already know about git and you have it installed.\nChange the directory to the directory of your site. Initialize it as a git repository. Add the theme as a git submodule. After this, copy the config.toml from the examplesite in the theme to the main folder. The other option is to append the theme using echo 'theme = \u0026quot;anatole\u0026quot;' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config.toml to the default config.toml that was added when the site was created. But this option would be a bare config without much in it. In order to leverage the theme better, it is a good idea to copy the config.toml over and modify it.\n3. Add Content \u0026amp; Start the server All the content for the site are expected to be in content folder as markdown files. For the first try, you can either add content by using hugo command hugo new posts/my-first-post.md, or copy sample content from the example site within the theme folder ./themes/anatole/exampleSite/content.\nhugo server -D This starts the server and you\u0026rsquo;d be able to view it at http://localhost:1313.\nYou can modify the content and the site will automatically rebuild. You can manually rebuild by simply typing hugo command on the command prompt.\nMigrate content from Jekyll 1. Content I initially thought I\u0026rsquo;d just move all the files from _posts directory in Jekyll root folder to content folder in Hugo root folder. But that gave a lot of parsing errors. Got to know that Hugo support TOML format where metadata is enclosed with 2 lines of +++ and has key = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; structure and also YAML format where metadata is enclosed with 2 lines of \u0026mdash; and has key : value structure. So it should support Jekyll\u0026rsquo;s YAML structure automatically. One of the keys \u0026lsquo;category\u0026rsquo; was a String in my yaml file and in the new theme, it was an array. So changing that to array, fixed the issue and I was able to copy over all the content.\n2. Static files - images, css My Jekyll set up had specific folders named css, js, img, etc. under the root folder to store static data. In Hugo, it is all in static folder under the root folder .\nI copied over css from the theme folder to override. Also copied over some template HTMLs from theme to layouts folder.\n3. Deploying to Github pages Github pages natively support Jekyll but not Hugo. So if I just replaced my github.io content with all the files from Hugo, it would not work at all.\nI already had my static page on https://github.com/robinsonraju/robinsonraju.github.io. Github automatically builds Jekyll pages, and puts the static files into _site directory. So we need to do the same. i.e., do a build, generate static files and put them into _site directory in \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io repo. The first thing I did was to take a backup of the contents inside \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io repo and delete everything in it. After that, went through the process to generate static files with hugo.\nThe process is pretty simple.\n Add the github repo as a submodule of the project repo.  git submodule add https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io.git \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io Change config.toml and update the publish directory - publishDir = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io\u0026quot;  baseURL = \u0026quot;https://\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;Website Title\u0026quot; theme = \u0026quot;anatole\u0026quot; publishDir = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io\u0026quot; Do a build using the command hugo in the command line. This updates _site folder in the publish directory which is our submodule.  hugo Push the changes in the submodule to github.  cd \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;.github.io git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit of HTML generated from hugo.\u0026quot; git push -u origin master A few other files that I had to copy over from my backup to the github.io repo were CNAME, google site verification html and favicon.ico. Otherwise, it worked as is.\n4. Customizations (Optional) You might notice that the website (https://robinsonraju.info) is different from anatole theme. It has 3 columns, the left nav is not as wide, the font is different, etc.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I copied over css from the theme folder to override and changed a bunch of them.\nI wanted to have a TOC on the posts and followed instructions from https://www.bram.us/2020/01/10/smooth-scrolling-sticky-scrollspy-navigation/ to achieve that. Copied over single.html from themes layouts into the local layouts/_default folder and modified it.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. All the best on your Hugo site.\n","description":"","id":30,"section":"tech-notes","tags":null,"title":"Setting up Hugo Site and Migrating from Jekyll","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/tech-notes/2020-05-04-setting-up-hugo-site/"},{"content":"I was introduced to The Knowledge Project by AJ last year during one of our 1-1 walks around the campus. He sent me the link to Naval Ravikant\u0026rsquo;s podcast after the walk, and I listened to it in the bus on the way back home. It was one of the best podcasts that I had listened to and was totally taken aback. It was like listening to a philosopher. I subscribed to the podcast and to the newsletter. One of the newsletters earlier this month spoke about the release of Volume 2 of The Great Mental Models. And I was like, wow, I haven\u0026rsquo;t even read the first volume. In order to be not left behind, I bought the kindle version of the books right away and started reading it.\nIt is a good read. But I think, it is one of those books where the hardcover would be better. Better formatted, with right things in the right pages. The book has many \u0026lsquo;sidebar\u0026rsquo; anecdotes or snippets that are very interesting but break the flow of the current topic at hand. Also, sometimes a picture that a paragraph refers to, could be found a couple of pages later. A kindle book is great when the content is mostly just text and it flows continuously. Going by the pictures of the book pages on fs.blog, looks like the hardcover would be a good buy. Probably will wait for all the books in the series to come out.\nWhat is a Mental Model? As the book says, \u0026lsquo;A mental model is simply a representation of how something works.' It is a way of looking at things and approaching problems that are presented to us. The chief goal in life, i.e if you want a comfortable life, is to have as few blind spots as one can. Either you work in a narrow area of your expertise or learn fast or try different things, you\u0026rsquo;re always consciously or unconsciously trying to figure out how to make tomorrow better than today. I feel that everyone has a mental model of what is needed to effectively do something. They are all probably smaller variations of some universal mental models. Knowing more, would enable us to think better and make informed decisions.\nThe book presents nine mental models as \u0026lsquo;general thinking concepts\u0026rsquo;. They are things that you\u0026rsquo;ve probably already heard of of know, but it is presented in a simple manner, with great quotes and memorable anecdotes.\nThe following are the mental models -\n The Map is not the Territory Circle of competence (Supporting Idea - Falsifiability) First principles thinking Thought experiment (Supporting Idea - Necessity and Sufficiency) Second-order thinking Probabilistic thinking (Supporting Idea - Causation vs Correlation) Inversion Occam’s razor Hanlon’s razor  1. The Map is not the territory In \u0026lsquo;The Map is not the territory\u0026rsquo; the Authors outline that the \u0026lsquo;map\u0026rsquo; is a miniature version of the land and not the land itself. Knowing the map can help navigate the terrain but only going on the terrain gives full understanding of the terrain. Maps are very useful since they abstract away a lot of complexities and information bloat. When we read news or a book summary, we\u0026rsquo;re reading abstractions created by other people who have condensed the information to smaller chunks to represent the actual information. The key issue with using maps is many times, we mistake map for the reality.\nIf I think of religion, I think though most religions have doctrines that are universal, many have rules that were written in the context of some particular scenario which has probably no relevance now. Map is useful only if we\u0026rsquo;re able to use feedback loops to update the map based on the changed terrain.\nThe chapter gives example of Newtonian physics and how it couldn\u0026rsquo;t explain interstellar phenomena that Einstein\u0026rsquo;s Special theory of relativity explains well.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand if the sidebar on \u0026lsquo;Tragedy of Commons\u0026rsquo; was cautioning against every person looking out to profit for themselves or not. Probably it means that if we\u0026rsquo;re working on a shared resource, the map becomes useless if everyone does things that doesn\u0026rsquo;t align with \u0026lsquo;sharing\u0026rsquo; principle.\nIn order to use the map effectively, one must take 3 important considerations -\n a. Reality is the ultimate update - The actual terrain may be different, map might have missed something. b. Consider the cartographer - The map maker might not be objective. What you might be seeing is one representation. c. Maps can influence territories - It is dangerous to fit complexity into simplification or extrapolate wrongly.  The chapter concludes by a short snippet about Frederick Taylor\u0026rsquo;s Scientific Theory of Management of breaking down tasks into smaller pieces and specializing people which worked great on the factory floor but had to be changed with time in different office settings. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t but wonder if Agile methodology is same as this!\n2. Circle of competence When one knows little, there is a sense of feeling of high confidence. The unknown unknowns are a lot. The chapter talks about a novice vs a lifer. A lifer is someone who has been in the place or industry for a long time and knows a lot of things about the domain. It would always make sense to get inputs from a lifer. To have a lifer as a mentor would be a great asset. Having sherpas as guides to climb Mt. Everest is a good example. A lifer/competent person knows what he/she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know and is able to make quickly and relatively accurately.\nAlso, even if you are an expert now, you should not operate as though the circle of competence is static. You must keep the knowledge updated. There are 3 key practices to build/maintain the circle of competence.\n Willingness to learn Monitor track record in areas that you have/want to have competence Occasionally solicit external feedback  3 parts to successfully operate outside the circle of competence -\n Learn by basics while acknowledging that you\u0026rsquo;re a novice. Talk to experts Use a broad understanding of the basic mental models of the world to augment your understanding of the new field.  The chapter cites examples of Queen Elizabeth 1, Warren Buffet\u0026rsquo;s advice on not straying from the circle of competence.\nFalsifiability - If you can\u0026rsquo;t prove something wrong, you can\u0026rsquo;t really prove it right either. if you keep eliminating things that don\u0026rsquo;t work, you strengthen things that work (evolution example). Karl Popper, who propounded the theory of Falsifiability, also put forth another idea on our false notion of historicism. We use examples from the past to make definite conclusions about what is going to happen in the future. This is dangerous. Think of the worst events in history. We look at the worst in the past and prepare for that. But the future could be worse than the worst.\n3. First Principles Thinking This is a way of breaking down any complex system or ideas into simple fundamental things, or building blocks. Once you see everything in terms of first principles, you\u0026rsquo;d be able to see how disparate things are connected. It is like taking apart a computer or a machine and putting it together. Once you\u0026rsquo;re able to do that you\u0026rsquo;re not only able to debug issues faster but also build new systems from the building blocks.\nTwo techniques - Socratic questioning and the Five Whys.\nSocratic questioning - disciplined questioning process, stops one from relying on gut and limits strong emotional responses.\nFive Whys - Determine the root cause of something by repeatedly asking \u0026lsquo;Why\u0026rsquo;. Each why is based on the previous answer.\nFirst principles thinking gives amazing results and innovative breakthroughs. E.g - H.pylori (stomach bacteria) discovery by Marshall and Warren, Curved carrier chute by Temple Grandin,First principles of meat, etc.\n4. Thought Expriment Thought exeperiment is a technique wherein one uses imagination to think through things that are not in existence or are not available currently. Lot of philosophical ideas have been based on thought experiements.\nThe chapter examines 3 areas in which thought experiments are very useful -\n  Imagining physical impossibilities - e.g. Einsten\u0026rsquo;s theory of Relativity or the train and the platform example in Stephen Hawking\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;A Brief History of Time\u0026rsquo;.\n  Re-imagining history - This is one of my favorite things to think about thing. Love TV series like \u0026lsquo;The Man in the High Castle\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Outlander\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;12 Monkeys\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Battlestar Galactica\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;The Expanse\u0026rsquo;, etc. which dwell not only on alternate history but also possible futures.\n  Intuiting the non-intuitive - A thought experiment allows us to verify if our gut instincts are correct or not.\n  Necessity and Sufficiency -\n  The gap between what is necessary to succeed and what is sufficient is often luck, chance, or some other factor beyond your direct control.\n  The hard truth - There could be thousands of people who write well and are able to publish but everyone cannot be J.K Rowling. Talent and hardwork is necessary to become a published author but not sufficient to become J.K Rowling. The gap, is huge!\n5. Second-Order Thinking Almost everyone can think of immediate consequences of doing something. But about the ripple effects? Second-order thinking is the ability think farther than immediate consequences. A lot of disasters in the world could be attributed to lack of second-order thinking.\nExample - During the colonial rule, The British wanted to reduce the number of poisonous snakes in Delhi and announced a reward for people who brought in dead snakes. People did. By growing more snakes to make money, they inadvertently increased the number of snakes!\nUse of plastics, smoking, bad city planning, overgrazing - there are too many examples of lack of thought when we look around the world.\n  Stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results.\n~ Margaret Atwood\n  What a quote !\nThe key think is to think forward as much as possible with all the information at hand. \u0026ldquo;Haste makes waste!\u0026rdquo;\n6. Probabilistic Thinking Probablistic thinking is to try to estimate the likelihood of an outcome by using data at hand. The whole world probably runs on Probablity! A self-driving car, a complex search algorithm, a Machine Learning model, they\u0026rsquo;re all using probability to produce an outcome that is most likely. The same is probably true of our minds also. The feedback loop is pretty great for our brains though. The success of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) is greatly due to it being modeled after neurons. Probablistic thinking avoids analysis paralysis and also waiting for ever for all the perfect data to be made available.\nThree important aspects that you need to be aware\n Bayesian thinking / Conditional probability - When making uncertain decisions, it is always important to check prior conditions. Fat-tailed curves - Beware of fat-tailed curves. They distort risk estimations. A small error is measuring the risk of an extreme event can mean we\u0026rsquo;re way off - by orders of magnitude, not 100 fold but 10,000 fold. I think the corona virus epidemic and the lack of preparation is a good example. Assymetries - How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% early? Almost never? How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% late? All the time? Or when you aim to get 25% returns on an investment, are you more likely to get 10% (-15) or 40% (+15) ?  7. Inversion Inversion is a technique to think from the opposite end of the problem. Flip the problem, think backward, start from the end rather than beginning, etc.\nThe chapter gives example of Edward Bernays\u0026rsquo;s revolutionary campaign to get women to smoke cigarettes. He approached by problem by imagining how it would be if smoking was already an accepted norm.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re stuck with something, invert. Even if not stuck, it always helps to think from different angles.\n8. Occam’s razor The simplest solutions are most likely to be the right ones. Simple explanations are more likely than complex ones.\nDavid Hume was very cautious about believing in miracles.\nVera Rubin was able to explain behavior of galaxies using the simpler theory of \u0026lsquo;dark matter\u0026rsquo;\n9. Hanlon’s razor A lot of things that we attribute to malice might be more easily explained by stupidity or laziness. Brings me back to the earlier quote from Margaret Atwood - \u0026ldquo;Stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results.\u0026rdquo;\n","description":"","id":31,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"The Great Mental Models: Volume 1 by Shane Parrish \u0026 Rhiannon Beaubien","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2020-04-28-great-mental-models/"},{"content":"I read this book on the way to and during the Alaska Trip that we took during last winter (2019). Read on the flight from SF to Portland and from there to Anchorage. The bulk of the reading was done during the full-day train journey from Anchorage to Fairbanks on the 3rd day of the trip. That was a magical train journey - to go through untouched snow in a vast land seemingly out of nowhere.\nI had listened to \u0026lsquo;Sapiens\u0026rsquo; through Hoopla a couple of years back. Probably twice. During my practice runs for the half-marathon that I was running that year and also during the run itself. Audio books are much slower reads than actual reading and I sometimes tend to zone out. Hoping to read the book on print/kindle in the future. But whatever I had heard, it was thought provoking and a well written book. It alters your perspective of the world and you begin to see the entire human history in a different light.\nThe author mentions that Sapiens was about the past of humanity, Home Deus was about the future and this book is about the present. He takes 21 problems, or 21 pressing concerns that the world if facing right now and addresses each of them. It is like reading 21 essays on different topics, well-articulated essays.\nPart I: The Technological Challenge Chapter 1: Disillusionment Humans think in stories than facts. Harari had mentioned in Sapiens that the key reason for ascendency of Homo Sapiens was the story telling ability.\n The fascist story - History is a struggle of nations/races and one tries to subjugate another. Let\u0026rsquo;s give importance to our nation and our ideals. The communist story - History is a struggle of classes where the upper class always tried to subjugate the lower. Let\u0026rsquo;s envision a classless society. The liberal story - History is a struggle of liberty and tyranny. Let\u0026rsquo;s build a world of freedom and equality.  1938 - 3 global stories to choose from, 1968 - 2 stories to choose from (liberal, communist), 1998 - a single story (liberal democracy), 2018 - no story. Disillusionment !\nHarari says that 2008 financial crisis precipitated the disillusionment and gave rise to a lot of pro-national sentiments. With the rise of Trump and Brexit in 2016, people seem to have developed a liking for the old racist and nationalist views. Nostalgia - Britain thinking of old glory, Islamist thinking of how things were 1400 yrs back during Caliphate, Zionists dreaming of going back 2,500 years back, and so forth!\nLoved the paragraph about \u0026ldquo;Humans vote with their feet\u0026rdquo;. So true! There are millions of people who wish to immigrate to the US, Germany, Canada or Australia. How many wish to immigrate to China, India or Vietnam? People are willing to undergo extreme hardship to just cross the border and come to the US though there is so much bad press about how immigrants are treated badly, especially the ones from south of the border. How many Islamists from Syria or other countries want to migrate to Kuwait or Saudi vs Germany?\nHarari defines a liberal set menu which outlines what it means at National and International level for Economic, Political and Personal areas. He is optimistic that people will not abandon liberal ideas altogether because of lack of viable alternatives. The dish might contain some items from the menu if not all.\nChapter 2: Work The fear of losing job to a machine has been there since the beginning of Industrial Revolution. But, if you look at the stats, for every job lost to a machine, at least one new job was created. Every job lost to the machine raised the standard of living multi-fold. But future may be different. Work in 2050 might to totally different since AI seeks to not just replace the mechanical work that humans do but cognitive also.\nThere are some tasks that AI is much better than humans. For e.g. driving. Driverless cars could reduce fatality by 90%! degree. Two important non-human abilities that AI possesses are connectivity and updatability. If there are a billion doctors in the world who need to be updated about a new disease, it is almost impossible, but if there were AI-doctors who are networked, it is almost instantaneous.\nIn areas like elder care, music, art, etc., it might take longer for AI to do what humans do.\nIn many fields, there might be more AI cooperation than competition. Also new jobs to debug, service AI will be created. But the key thing about the new jobs that will get created will be that they will require expertise. So retraining might be difficult.\nIn 2017 Google\u0026rsquo;s AlphaZero defeated Stockfish 8 program in a game of chess. The milestone was critical since AlphaZero learnt chess from scratch in 4 hours! AI is competing with other AI and not with humans anymore!\nThe author does say that rise of AI may not lead to exploitation of humans like it happened during the Industrial Revolution. It might get to a point where everything becomes efficient and people are provided with what they need - food, clothing \u0026amp; shelter. If one gets these things for free, will people go into irrelevance? Wow, one is reminded of \u0026lsquo;The Matrix\u0026rsquo; here. AI could actually put all humans to sleep and keep them in a dream state so that they don\u0026rsquo;t destroy the earth!\nThe author talks about UBI (Universal Basic Income) or Universal Basic Services where social services are subsidized. It could become the utopian vision of communism!\nHe gives example of ultra-orthodox Jews who are poor and unemployed and spend all their time in studying scriptures. They are supported by the government and they are reported to have higher life satisfaction than other groups who have money and are employed!\nThe chapter ends with a positive, powerful note - \u0026ldquo;The quest for meaning and community might eclipse the quest for a job. If we manage to combine a universal economic safety net with strong communities and meaningful pursuits, losing our jobs to algorithms might actually turn out to be a blessing.\u0026rdquo;\nChapter 3: Liberty During the Brexit vote, Ricard Dawkins had said that normal people should not have been asked to vote since most of them are not equipped to know the economic and political consequences of the decision. Elections are about what we feel and not what may be good for us. What people feel are mostly defined by their news feed or search results.\nComputer algorithm might be better equipped to counsel humans than human feelings.\nb×c×d = ahh Biological knowledge multiplied by Computing power multiplied by Data equals Ability to Hack Humans.\nAlgorithm could help you choose a better movie that you might like than you could, decide what to do based on mood, what to buy, which career to choose, etc. Human feelings are shaped by survival and reproduction a million years ago but it is not the case with AI/Algorithms.\nThe author says that knowledge of Philosophy will be in great demand since the algorithms need it to make basic decisions to create more complex ones.\nDigital dictatorship is more dangerous than any dictatorship that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the past. Stalin didn\u0026rsquo;t possibly know or have control over normal citizens. But AI could know about every single citizen. Big Data algorithms might extinguish liberty and also might simultaneously create the most unequal societies that ever existed.\nChapter 4: Equality The rise of liberalism and increase in globalization in the 1900s promised a more egalitarian society than all the centuries in the past put together. People in India and Egypt could enjoy the same opportunities and privileges as Finland and Canada!\nBut in the 2000s, the trend is changing. Wealth seems to be getting concentrated with the 1%. The richest 100 people own more than the poorest 4 billion people!\nWith the rise of AI and breakthroughs in biotechnology, the divide could get larger and impossible to reduce. Rich people in the past could buy more possessions or live in grandeur. The average rich person was not more intelligent than an average poor person. But now, they could soon have the ability to extend life, have more brain capacity, be more beautiful. The rich might become a set of superhumans who are like gods. This would result in the separation of humankind into a small class of superhumans and a massive underclass of ordinary Homo sapiens. Similar to Greek mythology!\nAs the superhumans evolve to a different species, they might choose to wall themselves off widening the inequality.\nIn the 21st century, data will eclipse land and machinery as the most important asset. The race to control more data is already on with all the big corporations vying for more control. At the moment, ordinary people are more than willing to give away their personal data. In a battle between privacy and health, health is likely to win. But that is fraught with so many dangers even leading to people losing their liberty. But there is no way to ensure private ownership of data at the moment. A technology innovation in that area is very necessary.\nPart II: The Political Challenge Chapter 5: Community In response to the growing nationalist sentiments after the 2016 elections, in 2017, Mark Zuckerberg published an audacious manifesto on the need to build a global community and that Facebook\u0026rsquo;s mission was to take this on. Breakdown of human communities was lamentable and Facebook could help people join meaningful communities online. Harari says that \u0026ldquo;finding meaningful communities and also strengthening our social fabric to bring the world closer together\u0026rdquo;, is more ambitious than even self-driving car. The goal is timely and noble.\nBut as more and more people live online, they are losing touch of their body, how it feels. People could listen to birds, know if a snake was in the grass by listening to the rustling, but now those skills are going away since people mostly are on their cellphones. People disconnected from their bodies are likely to feel alienated and disoriented. The time and energy you spend in communities online to connect with people across the world will be at the expense of your body, your family and your next door neighbors.\nChapter 6: Civilization Harari says that there is only one civilization in the world now. \u0026ldquo;The West\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;The Muslim World\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The East\u0026rdquo;, etc. may seem different but they are all operating under the same guidelines of modern civilization. Humans in the past were divided into isolated civilizations but not anymore.\nHe gives example of Olympics, it was probably inconceivable to conduct Olympic games at an international level 1000 years back but now it is possible.\nAnother example is medicine. In the past, people in different places were treated differently accordingly to the local belief systems or superstitions. But now, it is mostly identical. People use the same proven scientific approaches and believe in cells and bacteria.\nChapter 7: Nationalism Nationalism was and is needed for people to support large systems. Harari gives the example of tribes along the Nile river. A tribe or a small group could have easily perished in a famine if multiple tribes hadn\u0026rsquo;t come together as a nation to help build dam along the Aswan or other infrastructure to feed a large number of people.\nNationalism is actually not in the DNA of a Human. People might prefer to feed their immediate family rather than pay taxes to feed millions of unknown but still they do it. They believe in the propaganda and flag-waving and the feeling of shared history.\nThe problem starts when benign patriotism morphs into chauvinistic ultranationalism. Instead of believing that your nation is unique, if you believe that your nation is supreme and you will be blindly loyal to do whatever it takes to exert its superiority, your thinking is muddled and you\u0026rsquo;ve declared war. Reminded of Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s quote - \u0026ldquo;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\u0026rdquo;\nEconomic Challenge - Harari points out that extreme isolationism is completely divorced from economic realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national economies will collapse.\nNuclear Challenge - As more nations have nuclear power, without a robust system of international cooperation, there is no way to protect the world from nuclear destruction.\nEcological Challenge - Without international cooperation of multiple countries, the disastrous effects of global warming cannot be prevented.\nTechnological Challenge - With the rise of biotechnology, if there is no globally accepted ethical guidelines, it could be open season for Dr. Frankenstein.\nThe take away - \u0026ldquo;In order to take good care of your compatriots, you must cooperate with foreigners. So good nationalists should now be globalists.\u0026rdquo;\nChapter 8: Religion Even in the 21st century, truly secular people are a minority. Billions of people still ardently profess belief in Christianity, Hinduism or Islam. But are they really helping solve the problems of today? In many places, religion is part of the problem of humanity and not the solution, it seeks to divide people and not unite, which is very unfortunate since, of all the ideologies that Homo Sapiens have had over the last millions of years, religion is probably the best unifying force.\n3 types of problems in the 21st century\n  Technical problems - Agriculture/Medicine - How should farmers deal with severe droughts caused by global warming? If someone is very sick, should he/she be taken to a hospital or a religious place? Religious authority has dwindled in medicine and farming because people don\u0026rsquo;t associate religion with those anymore.\n  Policy problems - Economics - For questions like raising taxes, signing tariff agreements, grant authority to AI to make decisions about people\u0026rsquo;s lives, etc., people/govts turn to Economists and other modern financial theory. Does religion have much to contribute to the great policy debates of our time?\n  Identity problems - Even in the 21st century, religion gets to define who is \u0026lsquo;us\u0026rsquo; vs \u0026lsquo;them\u0026rsquo;. Many religions use it to divide people. The right approach probably is to adapt religion to new realities to unite people. Harari gives example of Japanese people having reinvented Shintoism.\n  Chapter 9: Immigration As he said earlier, \u0026ldquo;Humans vote with their feet\u0026rdquo;. World is more connected than ever and immigration is a reality. Harari views immigration as a deal with 3 basic conditions or terms -\n The host country allows the immigrants in. In return, the immigrants must embrace at least the core norms and values of the host country, even if this means giving up their traditional norms. \u0026ldquo;When in Rome, be Roman\u0026rdquo; If immigrants assimilate, over time, they become \u0026lsquo;us\u0026rsquo; than \u0026lsquo;them\u0026rsquo;.  There are always people in both camps. pro-immigration as well as anti-immigration. It is mostly a socio-economic issue. Many countries turn a blind eye to illegal immigration since they want to benefit from cheap labor of young foreigners. But they refuse to legalize the status, thus creating a society of upper class citizens who exploit powerless foreigners.\nImmigration also depends on the cultural make up of a country. Some countries are more tolerant and have mechanisms in place to assimilate them. For e.g. German culture in the twenty-first century is more welcoming of immigrants than Saudi culture. So a Syrian refugee might actually prefer to flee to Germany and not to Saudi.\nHarari illustrates the cultural differences using an example of fictional Coldians and Warmlanders.\n2 points to remember -\n It would be wrong for any government to force large scale immigration on a local population if they are unwilling. Though people might oppose immigration, they should realize that they have an obligation towards foreigners.  Part III: Despair and Hope Chapter 10: Terrorism Since 9/11, terrorism has killed around 25,000 people. In contrast, traffic accidents killed 1.25 million people, diabetes killed 3.5 million people and air pollution 7 million people. Terrorists kill few people but instill fear on billions and rattle big governments.\nHarari says that terrorists are like a fly that wants to destroy a china shop. But the fly is weak and has no power to even move a single cup. What does it do? It goes into a bulls ear and starts buzzing. The bull destroys the china shop!\nChapter 11: War In the past, war was the way of the world, the way to get more land and more manpower. But in the present, war is expensive, and countries that have not gone to war have prospered better.\nHuman stupidity is one of the most important forces in history, yet we often tend to discount it. One potential remedy for human stupidity is a dose of humility. National, religious, and cultural tensions are made worse by the grandiose feeling that my nation, my religion, and my culture are the most important in the world. People need to realize their true place in the world.\nChapter 12: Humility The truth is, everyone claims superiority. People are brainwashed from a young age to believe that their group, their religion is the center of the world. The key thing to remember is that the world is large and humans have created hundreds or religions. When we see things in the right perspective, you automatically become humble.\nChapter 13: God Harari says that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to necessarily believe in God to be moral. If you believe in not causing suffering to another human being or reducing the suffering of others, that would suffice.\nWould a human really care about another person\u0026rsquo;s misery? Most probably yes, people are social animals and their happiness depends to a large extent on the relations with others. So the belief in not causing suffering to another human is at the core of our existence and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need belief or fear of God to be so.\nReligious belief can create compassion and kindness in people but it can also stoke anger against people who do not follow their belief system.\nChapter 14: Secularism Secularism is a positive and active worldview. It is not opposed to religion. In fact, the core of most religion are secularist principles. Secularism views morality and wisdom as the natural legacy of all humans, not something handed down from God to a specific set of humans at a point in time.\nThe Secular Ideals -\n Commitment to truth Compassion Commitment to equality Cherish Responsibility  \u0026ldquo;Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.\u0026rdquo;\nPart IV: Truth Chapter 15: Ignorance Individual humans are pretty ignorant of their world. We rely mostly on the expertise of others whether we acknowledge it or not.\nMost of people\u0026rsquo;s views are shaped by communal groupthink rather than individual rationality, and they hold on to these views due to group loyalty. Stating facts to convince someone might actually backfire. True especially for superstitions people.\nHarari talks about how power acts like a blackhole that warps the spacetime around it. Leaders are trapped in it. They have the best knowledge at their disposal but might not be able to leverage it since people might say the right things other than flattery due to the lack of time.\nChapter 16: Justice According to Harari, there is injustice all around the world and most people live on being ignorant of the part that they are playing. What if the phone that I bought was created by child laborers? What if the company that I invested in and gives me 5% returns is involved in dumping toxic waste that kills sealife? What if the sugar that I\u0026rsquo;m having for tea results in slave trade across the world?\nThe world is so complex and interdependent that only the ignorant can judge and blame other. One could be abetting a crime just by sitting at home.\nChapter 17: Post-Truth We\u0026rsquo;re now living in a tragic world of fake news. There is no real way of separating truth from fake news. Propaganda and disinformation is nothing new. It existed in the past - Japanese army created the fake country of Manchukuo to legitimize its conquests, China has long denied that Tibet ever existed as an independent country, British settlement in Australia was justified by the legal doctrine of terra nullius (\u0026ldquo;no one\u0026rsquo;s land\u0026rdquo;), etc.\n\u0026ldquo;When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month, that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years, that’s a religion\u0026rdquo; !!\nHarari mentions that it is our responsibility to invest time and effort in uncovering our biases and in verifying our sources of information. Also, if you want reliable information, pay good money for it.\n\u0026ldquo;If you get your news for free, you might well be the product.\u0026rdquo;\nChapter 18: Science Fiction Harari says that in the 21st century, perhaps the most important genre is science fiction. It gets people excited (or fearful) about the future possibilities and also teaches about fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence more than what people try to read to find out. From that perspective, it is a great responsibility also. Sci-fi authors and movies can distort people\u0026rsquo;s views and give them bad ideas.\nHarari cites examples from Orwell\u0026rsquo;s 1984 and Huxley\u0026rsquo;s Brave New World.\nPart V: Resilience Chapter 19: Education It is more difficult than ever to predict the future. So we don\u0026rsquo;t know how things will be in 2050 and cannot really know what we should teach kids to prepare themselves for 2050. The schooling system has foundations in a past world when information was scarce and just knowing to read and write and getting the basics of geography, history and biology was a great improvement. But in today\u0026rsquo;s world, there is an information overload. So cramming information into kids is probably not the best use of time.\nWhat about teaching technologies that are important today - say coding in C++ or to talk Chinese? But after investing a lot of time in this, we might discover in 2050 that machines/AI can do this better than humans! What should the schools be teaching ? Experts agree on \u0026ldquo;the four Cs\u0026rdquo; — Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity.\nThe ability to constantly learn and reinvent yourself would be the key.\nChapter 20: Meaning Do we have a fixed \u0026lsquo;true\u0026rsquo; identity that determines our duties in life? Is our purpose in life to find this identity and fulfill it? Simba the lion was born to eat antelopes and Arjuna the warrior was born to fight battles and if they don\u0026rsquo;t they are shunning the natural course of events in a Circle of Life. Are they? Harari goes through a few more worldviews and concludes that all stories are incomplete.\nIn order to give meaning to life, a story needs to satisfy 2 conditions -\n It must give the individual a role to play. It must extend beyond the individuals horizons (as religious stories extends to eternity).  You cannot leave anything meaningfully tangible behind. So you might be better off just helping someone else.\nHuman quest for meaning all too often ends with a succession of sacrifices - self or others.\n3 basic realities of the universe by The Buddha -\n Everything is constantly changing Nothing has any enduring essence Nothing is completely satisfying  Chapter 21: Meditation Was surprised to see Harari mention about Vipassana meditation course. I\u0026rsquo;d heard about it from AM who has been my colleague since 2011.\nHarari talks about his first experience with meditation and says that he learned more about himself and about humans in general by observing his sensations for those ten days than he had learnt in his whole life up to that point.\nHe meditates for 2 hours every day! Remarkable.\nHe concludes by saying that we have a choice to make an effort and investigate who we really are.\n","description":"","id":32,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2020-01-18-21_lessons/"},{"content":"I read this book on the way back from our Alaska Trip during during last winter (2019). The trip itself was magical since it was like going to a different land that I\u0026rsquo;ve only seen in movies or read in books. Read the book in Fairbanks airport, in the flight from Fairbanks to Anchorage, Anchorage airport, in the flight from Anchorage to Portland, Portland airport and in the flight from Portland to SFO. The whole journey took a day since we started around 9-ish in the morning. The book was engaging and awesome. The twist in the end totally took me by surprise. Throughout the book, you feel like Hans Rosling is directly talking to you and then ..\nIt is a positive book. It tells us that the world is in a much better state than we think it is in. In that way it is very similar to Steven Pinker\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Better Angels of Our Nature\u0026rdquo;. Better Angels was the second book that Mark Zuckerberg had read in his 2015 book reading challenge. There are a lot of interesting insights in the book that would enable us to see life and the world in a different light. Instead of dividing the world and developed and developing, he divides it as Level 1, L2, L3 and level 4. One begins to see that many developing countries are much better off now.\n The gap instinct The negativity instinct The straight line instinct The fear instinct The size instinct The generalization instinct The destiny instinct The single perspective instinct The blame instinct The urgency instinct Factfulness in practice Factfulness rules of thumb.

And there are others that start with a bang. \u0026lsquo;Of love and other demons\u0026rsquo; is definitely in the latter category.\nThe books opens with a letter from Marquez on how he came upon the story. On a routine round to cover a story for his newspaper, the author is sent to find out about the emptying/transportation of crypts of Santa Clara Convent, which is in a dilapidated state. He comes across an astonishing sight when after one of the crypts is open, they see copper colored hair on a skeleton head. It was as if the hair grew after death out of the skeleton. The author is reminded of a story that his grandmother had told him about a young girl with long hair, who got bitten by a dog, became mad and was later venerated as a saint since she performed miracles.\nFrom the get go, when \u0026ldquo;an ash gray dog with a white blaze\u0026rdquo;, charges into a market and bites the protagonist, a young girl who is the daughter of a local nobleman, the novel transports the reader to a different place in a different era, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t let go. Till the last page, we\u0026rsquo;re intrigued by what is going to happen and are rooting for Sierva Maria to come out of the whole ordeal victorious.\nI\u0026rsquo;d always wanted to read Marquez. I\u0026rsquo;d heard about this famous book \u0026lsquo;One Hundred Years of Solitude\u0026rsquo; in high school or college, as a quiz question or may be it was a crossword puzzle on The Hindu. It was at the back of my mind. I read the prologue of this book our local library and was totally hooked. It was a worth read. AK also read the book. She also bought \u0026lsquo;One Hundred Years\u0026rsquo;. Haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten to reading that yet though.\nIn short, the novel is about a young girl getting bitten (very small bite) by a dog. She is actually not affected but due to the rumours and superstitions, she is forced to undergo exorcism by many people. Finally is brought to a convent. The young priest there falls in love with the girl. Though he recommends that she is not mad, the authorities don\u0026rsquo;t listen. It ends tragically for all the \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; people in the book.\nWhat is good and not good is often a gray area. If you follow society\u0026rsquo;s norms and act in the way it expects, then you\u0026rsquo;re branded as good. The religious fanaticism that existed in the 17th century South America exists even today, almost everywhere in the world.\nThe novel explores many themes, and one of them is the fight between good and evil. One could say that the \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; is the truth and everything that is natural in the world. The \u0026lsquo;evil\u0026rsquo; is dogma and superstition that plagued the society during that time period. A strong belief in demons and reliance on hearsay, made the people around Sierva Maria see her differently than what she really was. She was just a 12 year old adolescent who was coming out of childhood into adulthood. She was also a victim of neglect by her parents. Her Yoruban beliefs, songs, dances, painting her face black, etc. were part of her growing up and it was natural for her. But it was tangential to her European parents or the Church.\nIn a way, the novel conveys that going against the confines of the present norms can sometimes work, or sometimes go awry. When a new idea upends an old one, it is many times because of myriads of factors that led to that time. Though people always venerate heroes who led the revolution without realizing that the people were the instruments and the revolution would have happened regardless of that particular person.\nAlso, I think the novel depicts that the conflict between good and evil is a human condition. Though we could judge the people based on our moral compass and group them as good vs evil, every person is fighting the battle against evil. What he or she thinks is evil could be based on his/her level of intelligence or what they\u0026rsquo;ve been told. It is not just the external evil but also the internal one. The internal conflict sometimes manifests externally by being too good to people or too cruel. So a human life\u0026rsquo;s journey is about fighting their own battle with their hidden evil and also fighting the external forces of evil from their standpoint.\nThe novel also alludes to the fact that people may not fully be in control of their destiny. One can only attempt to be true to oneself and hope that it aligns with the surroundings.\nOf Love and Other Demons\n","description":"","id":34,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"Of Love and Other Demons by Gabriel Garcia Marquez","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2019-10-15-of-love-and-other-demons/"},{"content":"Jordan Peterson is one of those people who does not mince words.

Every rule is a context where he explains his philosophy and the reasoning behind them.

With enchanting short real-life stories and fascinating anecdotes, he takes you right into the book, to a different world where you are a student who is observing and studying the behavior of the people in different parts of the world, effortlessly moving to and fro through different periods of time.\nINTRODUCTION - The Statue That Didn’t Look Right  Fast and Frugal The Internal Computer A Different and Better World  This chapter tells the story of a kouros that was purchased by Paul Getty museum. The museum authorities had certified it as legitimate after over 2 years of research. But during the opening, some art historians and other experts \u0026lsquo;felt\u0026rsquo; that it was fake by just looking at it.\n In the first two seconds of looking — in a single glance — they were able to understand more about the essence of the statue than the team at the Getty was able to understand after fourteen months.\nBlink is a book about those first two seconds.\n The chapter lays a foundation for what the book is about and is a very engaging introduction to keep you from putting the book down.\nONE - The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way  The Love Lab Marriage and Morse Code The Importance of Contempt The Secrets of the Bedroom Listening to Doctors The Power of the Glance  The chapter starts with the story of a couple in their twenties - Bill \u0026amp; Susan - who go to the University of Washington to visit the laboratory of a psychologist named John Gottman. They talk about their dog and Gottman videotapes the conversation for 15 minutes. Gottman and team then assign a SPAFF code to every second of the couple\u0026rsquo;s interaction. [SPAFF code assigns a number to every emotion - Disgust is 1, contempt is 2, anger is 7, defensiveness is 10 .. and so on]. Gottman has proven that he got 95% success of predicting whether a marriage will endure or not by using 1 hour of video and 90% success by 15 minutes.\n To make an accurate prediction about something as serious as the future of a marriage indeed, to make a prediction of any sort — it seems that we would have to gather a lot of information and in as many different contexts as possible.\nBut John Gottman has proven that we don’t have to do that at all.\n He goes further to say that of all the emotions in the SPAFF code, he can find out much about a couple by just focusing on what he calls the \u0026ldquo;Four Horsemen\u0026rdquo;: defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Of these 4, contempt is the most important of them all. Criticism is good in a relationship but contempt is very bad.\n ..presence of contempt in a marriage can even predict such things as how many colds a husband or a wife gets; in other words, having someone you love express contempt toward you is so stressful that it begins to affect the functioning of your immune system.\n Then he talks about doctors who get sued vs who don\u0026rsquo;t and about the research that was done by studying hundreds of recorded conversations between doctors and patients. It is not the doctors with less degrees or qualifications who get sued but mostly the ones that don\u0026rsquo;t talk much to patients.\nHe also talks about how some people are able to make judgments with just a glance. Brian Grazer knew that Tom Hanks was a star material at the very first meeting !\nTWO - The Locked Door: The Secret Life of Snap Decisions  Primed for Action The Storytelling Problem  The chapter starts with the story of Vic Braden, a top tennis coach who could predict when a player would make a double fault. Double faults are rare but he could almost always predict them. But he was unable to explain how he was able to do it. Gladwell goes on to say that snap judgements happen so fast that our conscious mind cannot grasp all the infomration that was used in that instant to arrive at the judgement. When we try to break the process down to explain, we fail to express clearly the thought process that went behind.\nHe then talks about a priming experiment where when a group of students were \u0026lsquo;primed\u0026rsquo; by telling them a set of words like \u0026ldquo;rude\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;bold\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;disturb\u0026rdquo; ..etc, their behavior was different from another set of students who were primed with different set of pleasant words. Wow! What we listen to matters so much.\nThen he talks about the \u0026lsquo;Speed dating\u0026rsquo; experiment done by Iyengar and Fisman from Columbia. When someone said they liked another, the researchers would ask them to explain the reason they cannot. In fact, what the participants said they liked differed from what they actually liked. For e.g, someone said they like people who are intelligent and sincere but they end up choosing someone who is attractive and funny but not particularly sincere or smart at all !\nHe goes on to say that it happens because people are not able to open the locked door - to access the subconscious that made the snap judgement.\nTHREE - The Warren Harding Error: Why We Fall For Tall, Dark, and Handsome Men  The Dark Side of Thin Slicing Blink in Black and White Taking Care of the Customer Spotting the Sucker Think About Dr. King  This chapter was a bit of a \u0026lsquo;reality check\u0026rsquo;. Until this point, we are in complete awe of the power of snap judgements, thin slicing ..etc and everything comes crashing down in this chapter. It is like someone saying - \u0026ldquo;listen to your intuition\u0026rdquo; and the moment you are prepared to do that, someone says \u0026ldquo;intuition is bad because we are swayed by our prejudices and what we have been exposed to\u0026rdquo;. The author then gives a series of word associations with European vs African American and Men vs Women. The exercise was interesting.\nHe then talks about and extra ordinarily successful salesman named\nFOUR - Paul Van Riper’s Big Victory: Creating Structure for Spontaneity FIVE - Kenna’s Dilemma: The Right— and Wrong—Way to Ask People What They Want SIX - Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading CONCLUSION - Listening with Your Eyes: The Lessons of Blink Afterword ","description":"","id":39,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"Blink - The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcom Gladwell","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2016-12-15-blink/"},{"content":"The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Result by Gary Keller with Jay Papapsan\n \u0026ldquo;If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.\u0026rdquo; ~ Russian Proverb\n This is the first book that I\u0026rsquo;m reading from \u0026ldquo;Prime Reading\u0026rdquo; catalog. I discovered Prime reading accidentally, that too when searching for deals during thanksgiving !! It is a great offering from Amazon. I\u0026rsquo;m amazed. I always felt that kindle/prime lending wasn\u0026rsquo;t that great. You never got the book that you wanted, there were restrictions around one per month..etc. I thought I will stop my prime membership next year since I\u0026rsquo;m not using prime much and haven\u0026rsquo;t had a lot of time to view movies or TV series off late. But due to \u0026ldquo;Prime Reading\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;ll continue with prime for a long time, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a great collection yet, but I think it will come. Looking forward to a day where I can borrow books from my local library through kindle. I can borrow e-books and read from \u0026lsquo;Overdrive\u0026rsquo; app on my phone but still nothing matches the experience of reading from a kindle.\nMy impression of reading this book was that it was very inspiring. It is an easy, fast read, one feels like the author is an inspiring preacher who talks to you from a podium and you\u0026rsquo;re listening to him with rapt attention. You would love the idea of focusing on one thing, timeblocking (4 hours !) and other practical steps to make life more streamlined. After reading the book, you walk away with a feeling that you\u0026rsquo;ve gained an insight and will transform your life to follow what was said. Of course, after a few days, you go back to being the old self, being reactive to everything around and multi-tasking and not have time for anything. I think reading the notes again will re-inforce the learning and will slowly change the way you do things.\nHighlights from my Kindle \u0026ldquo;Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it.

Finally, out of desperation, I went as small as I could possibly go and asked: \u0026ldquo;What’s the ONE Thing you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?\u0026rdquo; And the most awesome thing happened.

It does make sense. When you line up the right things, with one flick, you can start a chain reaction of great things.\nSuccess builds on success. When you see someone who has a lot of knowledge, they learned it over time. When you see someone who has done a lot, they accomplished it over time. The key is \u0026lsquo;over time\u0026rsquo;.\nChapter 3 : Success Leaves Clues  \u0026ldquo;It is those who concentrate on but one thing at a time who advance in this world.\u0026rdquo; ~ Og Mandino\n Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.\nWhen the author says \u0026ldquo;The ONE Thing shows up time and again in the lives of the successful because it’s a fundamental truth.\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the \u0026lsquo;Matthew Effect\u0026rsquo; from \u0026ldquo;Outliers\u0026rdquo; - \u0026lsquo;To one who has, more will be given ..'\u0026rdquo;\nPART 1 : The Lies - They Mislead and Derail Us The Six Lies Between You and Success:\n Everything Matters Equally Multitasking A Disciplined Life Willpower Is Always on Will-Call A Balanced Life Big is Bad  Chapter 4.\tEverything Matters Equally  \u0026ldquo;Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.\u0026rdquo; —Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n When everything feels important, everything seems equal. We become busy-bodies, fully active but not moving towards success. Busyness rarely takes care of business !!\nIn his seminal book Quality Control Handbook, Juran adopted Pareto principle of 20/80 to highlight “vital few and trivial many\u0026rdquo;. 20% of things that we do has 80% of impact.\nTransform to-do list to \u0026lsquo;success list\u0026rsquo;. Take 20% of the to-do list to make the success list. Take the 20% of that, iteratively you can reach the \u0026lsquo;one\u0026rsquo; most important thing.\nChapter 5.\tMultitasking  \u0026ldquo;To do two things at once is to do neither.\u0026rdquo; —Publilius Syrus\n Multitasking is a lie. There is a cost to task-switching that most people don\u0026rsquo;t realize they are paying. Distraction undermines results and you can end up doing nothing well. Also it takes a toll on mind and body.\nChapter 6.\tA Disciplined Life  \u0026ldquo;It’s one of the most prevalent myths of our culture: self-discipline.\u0026rdquo; —Leo Babauta\n Success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right. \u0026lsquo;Selected discipline\u0026rsquo; by channeling the energy to important things is very crucial. It takes an average of 66 days to form a habit. Build one habit at a time and give each habit enough time so that it becomes a routine.\nChapter 7.\tWillpower Is Always on Will-Call  \u0026ldquo;Odysseus understood how weak willpower actually is when he asked his crew to bind him to the mast while sailing by the seductive Sirens.\u0026rdquo; —Patricia Cohen\n Willpower is alway on-call is a lie. Like the charge of a battery, it goes down with usage. So it is super important to prioritize the right thing to do when willpower is higher.\nWillpower is important. For e.g., the Marshamallow experiment done by Walter Michel at Stanford in the 60s and 70s where kids were given a marshamallow and were told that they could have that now or if they wait for 15 minutes, they could eat two. Kids who exercised willpower and delayed their gratification were found (on average) to be more successful later in life.\nWillpower gets reduced on usage. Another study done at Stanford by Prof Baba Shiv - where he divided undergrad students into 2 groups and asked them to memorize some numbers. The first group had to memorize 2-digit numbers and the second 7-digit numbers. They had to then walk across a hallway, to another room and tell the numbers to someone. On the way, they were offered 2 foods - chocolate cake or fruit salad. Students who were asked to memorize 7-digit numbers were twice as likely to choose chocolate (unhealthy treat) since they had reduced willpower.\nWillpower gets reduced if you don\u0026rsquo;t eat. Research shows that people who do not eat make roughly twice as many errors than those who do.\nWhen willpower is low, we tend to fallback on default settings or on autopilot. This leads to errors in judgement.\nMany things tax our willpower - Implementing new behaviors, Filtering distractions, Resisting temptation, Suppressing emotion, Restraining aggression, Suppressing impulses, Taking tests, Trying to impress others, Coping with fear, Doing something you don’t enjoy, etc.\nMost important thing to remember is that when it comes to willpower, timing is crucial.\nChapter 8.\tA Balanced Life  \u0026ldquo;The truth is, balance is bunk. It is an unattainable pipe dream\u0026hellip; . The quest for balance between work and life, as we’ve come to think of it, isn’t just a losing proposition; it’s a hurtful, destructive one.\u0026rdquo; —Keith H. Hammonds\n Balanced life is a lie, a myth. The term itself was coined only in the 1980s.\nMagic happens at the extremes. To achieve extraordinary results one must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. That may be work or life. And then counterbalance later to offset it.\nThink about life as two balancing buckets - work life and personal life, each with its own counterbalancing goals and approaches.\nChapter 9.\tBig Is Bad  \u0026ldquo;We are kept from our goal, not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal.\u0026rdquo; —Robert Brault\n Big is bad is a lie. You should not be afraid of big success and end up sabotaging your own efforts to achieve it. There are a lot of examples of people who went all in and lost everything. And those are used to create fear. So we tend to play it safe.\nNo one knows the ultimate limit of what we can achieve. So it is better to think big, dream big.\nThink big - Act big - Succeed big.\nPART 2 : The Truth – The Simple Path to Productivity  \u0026ldquo;Be careful how you interpret the world; it is like that.\u0026rdquo; — Erich Heller\n Chapter 10.\tThe Focusing Question  \u0026ldquo;There is an art to clearing away the clutter and focusing on what matters most. It is simple and it is transferable. It just requires the courage to take a different approach.\u0026rdquo; — George Anders\n Great questions are path to great answers.\n\u0026ldquo;Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.\u0026rdquo; - Voltaire\n\u0026ldquo;A prudent question is one-half of wisdom.\u0026rdquo; - Sir Francis Bacon\n\u0026ldquo;The power to question is the basis of all human progress.\u0026rdquo; - Indira Gandhi\nFocusing Question -\n \u0026ldquo;WHAT’S the one thing I can do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary.\u0026quot;\n Chapter 11.\tThe Success Habit  \u0026ldquo;Success is simple. Do what’s right, the right way, at the right time.\u0026rdquo; —Arnold H. Glasow\n The Focusing Question is the foundational habit to use to achieve great results.\nImportant areas of life\n Spiritual Life Physical Health Personal Life Key Relationships Job Business Financial Life  Leverage reminders and recruit support to keep your success habit working as powerfully as possible.\nChapter 12.\tThe Path to Great Answers  \u0026ldquo;People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.\u0026rdquo; —F. M. Alexander\n Four options for framing a Great Question.\nQ4. Small \u0026amp; Specific\nQ3. Small \u0026amp; Broad\nQ2. Big \u0026amp; Broad\nQ1. Big \u0026amp; Specific\nWhen you ask a Great Question, you’re in essence pursuing a great goal.\nThinking big and specific is key to a great question. Think Possibilities and benchmark and trend for the best answer.\nPART 3 : Extraordinary Results - Unlocking the Possibilities Within You  \u0026ldquo;Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.\u0026rdquo; — Will Rogers\n Chapter 13.\tLive with Purpose  \u0026ldquo;Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.\u0026rdquo; —George Bernard Shaw\n Gary goes over Scrooge\u0026rsquo;s story to illustrate that \u0026ldquo;our purpose sets our priority and our priority determines the productivity our actions produce\u0026rdquo;.\nYou cannot seek happiness. It happens in the journey. Discover your big \u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rdquo; and do things that bring purpose to your everyday actions.\nChapter 14.\tLive by Priority  \u0026ldquo;Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now.\u0026rdquo; —Alan Lakein\n Purpose is very important and has the power to shape our lives only in direct proportion to the power of the priority we connect it to. Purpose without priority is powerless.\nFuture purpose should connect to current priority.\nChapter 15.\tLive for Productivity  \u0026ldquo;Productivity isn’t about being a workhorse, keeping busy or burning the midnight oil\u0026hellip; . It’s more about priorities, planning, and fiercely protecting your time.\u0026rdquo; —Margarita Tartakovsky\n Extraordinary results come when you get the most out of what you do.\nTime blocking is key for achieving great productivity.\nTime block 3 things in the following order -\n Time block your timeoff. Time block your ONE Thing. Time block your planningtime.  To experience extraordinary results, be a \u0026lsquo;maker\u0026rsquo; in the morning and a \u0026lsquo;manager\u0026rsquo; in the afternoon.\n4 proven ways to battle distractions -\n Build a bunker Store provisions Sweep for mines Enlist support  Chapter 16.\tThe Three Commitments  \u0026ldquo;Nobody who ever gave his best regretted it.\u0026rdquo; —George Halas\n Mastery can happen only if you commit to be the best. Take ownership of your outcomes.\nThe 3 commitments to your one thing:\n Follow the Path of Mastery Move from \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; (Entrepreneurial) to \u0026ldquo;P\u0026rdquo; (Purposeful). Live the Accountability Cycle  Chapter 17.\tThe Four Thieves  \u0026ldquo;Focus is a matter of deciding what things you’re not going to do.\u0026rdquo; —John Carmack\n The 4 thieves of Productivity\n Inability to say \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; Fear of Chaos Poor Health Habits Environment Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Support Your Goals  I\u0026rsquo;ve personally had issues with 1 and 2. The key thing to remember is \u0026ldquo;When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to.\u0026quot; Also, make peace with loose ends and clutter!\nChapter 18.\tThe Journey  \u0026ldquo;To get through the hardest journey we need take only one step at a time, but we must keep on stepping.\u0026rdquo; —Chinese Proverb\n A life worth living might be measured in many ways, but the one way that stands above all others is living a life of no regrets. One step at a time, focusing on the ONE big thing.\nPutting The ONE Thing to Work  \u0026ldquo;In delay there lies no plenty.\u0026rdquo; -William Shakespeare\n The key thing to make it work is to develop the habit of asking the \u0026lsquo;Focusing Question\u0026rsquo; and keep it up.\n","description":"","id":40,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"The One Thing by Gary Keller","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2016-11-26-the-one-thing/"},{"content":"For someone who has been doing Java programming and reading through lot of OO codebase for over a decade, functional programming is truly a paradigm shift. It is not like learning a different language or different version of Java from Java 2 (1.2) to Java 8. The first time I was exposed to functional programming is probably around 2012 when I had to do a project for an ML course using R language. It was refreshing to do things differently for sure. Thanks to RV, I learnt the basics of Clojure last year. I\u0026rsquo;m at a stage where I can read Clojure code and understand and may be write very simple programs but not beyond that. Anyway, the paradigm shift that Ford talks about can be summarized in the example that he gives in the first chapter of the book.\n Let’s say for a moment that you are a lumberjack. You have the best axe in the forest, which makes you the most productive lumberjack in the camp. Then one day someone shows up and extols the virtues of a new tree-cutting paradigm, the chainsaw. The sales guy is persuasive, so you buy a chainsaw, but you don’t know how it works. Demonstrating your expertise with the previous tree-cutting paradigm, you swing it vigorously at a tree—without cranking it. You quickly conclude that this newfangled chainsaw is a fad, and you return to your axe. Then, someone appears and shows you how to crank the chainsaw.\n The best thing about the book is that he gives a lot of code examples. So one needs to just think of how to solve these examples and get the gist of what is being talked about.\nChapter 1 : Why  \u0026ldquo;OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code under‐ standable by minimizing moving parts.\u0026rdquo; ~ Michael Feathers\n This chapter provides a broad overview and shows some examples of the mental shift that the author is teaching us.\n Example 1-1. Word frequencies in Java Example 1-2. Word frequencies in Java 8 Example 1-3. indexOfAny() from Apache Commons StringUtils  The IndexofAny() method accepts a String and an array and returns the index of the first occurrence in the String of any of the characters in the array   Example 1-4. indexOfAny() example cases Example 1-5.

Returning a lazy list of matches  Excercise to self\n Write a program in Java 8 or Clojure which takes in a String of words separated by space (\u0026ldquo;a quick brown fox\u0026rdquo;) and returns a map of word frequencies. Write a program in Java 8 or Clojure that mimics \u0026lsquo;indexOfAny() from Apache Commons StringUtils\u0026rsquo;. This method accepts a String and an array and returns the index of the first occurrence in the String of any of the characters in the array.  Chapter 2 : Shift  \u0026ldquo;Once garbage collection became mainstream, it simultaneously eliminated entire categories of hard-to-debug problems and allowed the runtime to manage a process that is complex and error-prone for developers. Functional programming aims to do the same thing for the algorithms you write, allowing you to work at a higher level of abstraction while freeing the runtime to perform sophisticated optimizations.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\n  Example 2-1. Typical company process (in Java)  Let’s say that you are given a list of names, some of which consist of a single character, and you are asked to return a comma-delimited string with the single letter names removed, with each name capitalized.   Example 2-2. Pseudocode for the “company process” Example 2-3. Processing functionally in Scala Example 2-4. Java 8 version of the Company Process Example 2-5. Processing in Groovy Example 2-6. Processing in Clojure  \u0026ldquo;One of Clojure’s selling points is that it removes concurrency as a developer concern just as Java removed garbage collection.\u0026quot;   Example 2-7. Improved readability for Clojure via the thread-last macro Example 2-8. Scala processing in parallel Example 2-9. Java 8 parallel processing Example 2-10. Number classifier in Java  Perfect : Sum of factors = number Abundant : Sum of factors \u0026gt; number Deficient : Sum of factors \u0026lt; number Consider aliquotSum where sum of factors doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain the number itself.

The author shows code in Scala, Groovy and Clojure.\nExcercise to self\n Write a progam in Java 8 or Clojure that, given a list of names, some of which consist of a single character, returns a comma-delimited string with the single letter names removed, with each name capitalized. Write a program in Java 8 or Clojure that implements Number Classification. i.e, given a number, the program outputs if the number is perfect, abundant or deficient. Write a program in Clojure that takes in a range of numbers and returns numbers that are divisible by 3.  Chapter 3 : Cede  \u0026ldquo;Confession: I never want to work in a non-garbage-collected language again. I paid my dues in languages like C++ for too many years, and I don’t want to surrender the conveniences of modern languages. That’s the story of how software development progresses.\u0026rdquo;\n It\u0026rsquo;s so great to see this comment in the book! I spent close to a year in 2007 and over a year in 2015-2016 to re-engineer C++ applications into Java. Though the projects were for different companies (ebay and paypal), co-incidentally, both applications were related to payments!\nIn this chapter, the author shows five ways developers in functional languages can cede control to the language or runtime, freeing themselves to work on more relevant problems.\n Iteration to Higher-Order Functions Closures Currying and Partial Application  Currying describes the conversion of a multiargument function into a chain of single-argument functions. Partial application describes the conversion of a multiargument function into one that accepts fewer arguments, with values for the elided arguments supplied in advance.   Recursion Streams and Work Reordering   Example 3-1. Simple closure binding in Groovy Example 3-2. Executing the closure block Example 3-3. Another closure binding Example 3-4.

Recursive filtering in Scala Example 3-24. Java 8 version of the company process  A note on Erlang\u0026rsquo;s tail-call optimization.\n \u0026ldquo;Given Erlang’s impressive fault-tolerance capabilities, there are likely tail-recursive loops in production that have run for years (!) uninterrupted.\u0026rdquo;\n[emphasis and exclamation added by self. ]\n Excercise to self\n Write a closure (function that returns a function) in Clojure. Write a function in Clojure that uses partial function. (partial is a function which takes a function f and a fewer-than-required number of arguments and returns a partially applied function that’s invokable when you supply the remaining arguments)  Chapter 4 : Smarter, Not Harder  \u0026ldquo;Even if you don’t care about functional languages such as Scala or Clojure, functional programming will enter your life through the langauge(s) you now use as they evolve.\u0026rdquo;\n In this chapter Ford discusses two features common in functional languages: memoization (function level caching) and laziness (Lazy evaluation — deferral of expression evaluation for as long as possible).\n Example 4-1. Caching sum Example 4-2. Testing nonoptimized speed Example 4-3. Caching everything Example 4-4. Memoizing sum Example 4-5. Memoizing everything Example 4-6. Inline memoization in Groovy Example 4-7.

I searched a bit for an eclipse plugin to be able to create a MR project through eclipse that would have the template for Mapper and Reducer and I would just write the implementation. Found some plugins (e.g HDT) and some screencasts but didn\u0026rsquo;t take me far. Remembered that there was an eclipse icon in the Cloudera VM. Started the VM, clicked on the icon and viola ! there was a sample project with Stubs for Mapper, Reducer and Driver. Exactly what I needed!\nPut in the code for Mapper, Reducer and Driver in the Stub classes and ran the Driver. It worked like a charm. Here is the code for it.\nMapper The map method takes key, value and context as inputs. The key represents the name of a document and the value is the contents of the document. For e.g, a record in a file. The map method below uses StringTokenizer to split the record into words, loops through the words and writes a 2-tuple (word, 1) into the context. Each mapper does this and what we get in the end is a list of key-value pairs.\nimport java.io.IOException; import java.util.StringTokenizer; import org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable; import org.apache.hadoop.io.LongWritable; import org.apache.hadoop.io.Text; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Mapper; public class StubMapper extends Mapper\u0026lt;LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable\u0026gt; { private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1); private Text word = new Text(); @Override public void map(LongWritable key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException { String line = value.toString(); StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(line); while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) { word.set(tokenizer.nextToken()); context.write(word, one); } } }  Reducer A reducer takes an input of a key and list of values associated with the key, adds the counts and writes the output to the context.\nFor e.g, input of (world, 1), (world, 1) gives output as (world, 2).\nimport java.io.IOException; import org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable; import org.apache.hadoop.io.Text; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Reducer; public class StubReducer extends Reducer\u0026lt;Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable\u0026gt; { @Override public void reduce(Text key, Iterable\u0026lt;IntWritable\u0026gt; values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException { int sum = 0; for (IntWritable val : values) { sum += val.get(); } context.write(key, new IntWritable(sum)); } }  Driver import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path; import org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable; import org.apache.hadoop.io.Text; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Job; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.TextInputFormat; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputFormat; import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.TextOutputFormat; public class StubDriver { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { /* * Validate that two arguments were passed from the command line. */ if (args.length != 2) { System.out.printf(\u0026quot;Usage: StubDriver \u0026lt;input dir\u0026gt; \u0026lt;output dir\u0026gt;\\n\u0026quot;); System.exit(-1); } /* * Instantiate a Job object for your job's configuration. */ Job job = new Job(); /* * Specify the jar file that contains your driver, mapper, and reducer. * Hadoop will transfer this jar file to nodes in your cluster running * mapper and reducer tasks. */ // job.setJarByClass(StubDriver.class); job.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class); job.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class); job.setMapperClass(StubMapper.class); job.setReducerClass(StubReducer.class); job.setInputFormatClass(TextInputFormat.class); job.setOutputFormatClass(TextOutputFormat.class); FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(args[0])); FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(args[1])); /* * Specify an easily-decipherable name for the job.

International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications, 443-450.\n Couple of weeks back we\u0026rsquo;d reviewed TTTD algorithm and an improvement of TTTD. While TTTD can chunk data according to data content and is more efficient than BSW, it has poor stability and the distribution of chunk sizes is too diverging.\nThis paper documents research done on distribution of chunk sizes and proposes Two Directions Sliding Window (TDSW) Algorithm for solving the distribution issue. The paper also talks about experiments with TDSW algorithm which show that there is a reduction of 30% in unbiased variance\nand 50% in running time.\nHeader Image - \u0026ldquo;Axis of stability\u0026rdquo; by TJ Gehling via Flickr\n","description":"","id":50,"section":"tech-notes","tags":null,"title":"Distributional Stability of Chunk Sizes in Data Chunking","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/tech-notes/2015-02-22-distributional-stability-of-chunk-sizes-in-data-chunking/"},{"content":"Paper reviewed:\n Schleimer, S., Wilkerson, D.

ACM SE ’10 Proceedings of the 48th Annual Southeast Regional Conference.\n Last week I spent some time understanding hash-based data deduplication systems. It felt great to revisit Rabin-Karp Algorithm for string matching. This algorithm was my focus in CS 255 and I had implemented it using Monte Carlo and Las Vegas approaches (A Monte Carlo algorithm has a guaranteed completion time but fails to output a correct answer with a small probability, A Las Vegas algorithm has guaranteed correctness but fails to complete with a small probability).\nBefore trying to dedupe data, it needs to be chunked. There are many algorithms to do that. The Basic Sliding Window (BSW) algorithm is one of the earliest and widely used. The Two Thresholds Two Divisors (TTTD) algorithm is an improvement over this.\nThis paper proposes an improvement over the TTTD algorithm.\nI still need to find a better system to embed a presentation in a static page.

In the 21st century, power is easy to get, harder to use - and easy to lose.\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026lsquo;The End of Power\u0026rsquo; was the first book chosen. The theme of the book is that power is not what it used to be. People in power are not as powerful as in the past and not as much as we sometimes think them to be. Power has weakened because barriers to power have reduced by the \u0026ldquo;More\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Mobility\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Mentality\u0026rdquo; revolution. The book makes one think about the world around us. In a way, the world has become more democratic and ordinary people have access/chance to rise to the top but when one looks at the world from the top, it is more chaotic and difficult to manage. One might choose to not get into management/leadership positions because of this.\nChapter 1\t: The Decay of Power  \u0026ldquo;Power is the ability to direct or prevent the current or future actions of other groups and individuals.\u0026rdquo;\n This chapter gives the example of James Black Jr., a 12 yr old from a working class family in Brooklyn, NY who becomes a Chess Grandmaster at the age of 12. It is a global trend. More players are learning the game and achieving mastery sooner than their predecesors, many of them on their own!. The reason is because the easier access to knowledge - of millions of games by other Grandmasters or computer simulation of moves, made by digital revolution and the internet. The author goes on to say that the similar trend is seen in all the other aspects of life. The chapter also gives us an overview of what the book\u0026rsquo;s is going to talk about.\nChapter 2\t: Making Sense of Power: How It Works and How to Keep It  \u0026ldquo;Identify the barriers to power and whether they are coming up or going down, and you can solve a large part of the puzzle of power.\u0026rdquo;\n The main theme of this chapter is extend the definition of power in the first chapter. Power is expressed through four different means - The Muscle, The Code, The Pitch, The Reward.\nMacMillan\u0026rsquo;s Taxonomy of Power\n    Outcome seen as improvement Outcome seen as nonimprovement     Change incentives Inducement via reward: Increase the salary, lower a price Coercion via muscle: Law enforcement, repression, violence   Change preferences Persuasion via pitch: Advertising, campaigning Obligation via code: Religious or traditional duty, moral suasion    Chapter 3\t: How Power Got Big: An Assumption\u0026rsquo;s Unquestioned Rise  \u0026ldquo;Weber’s central message was that without a reliable, well-functioning organization, or, to use his term, without a bureaucracy, power could not be effectively wielded.\u0026rdquo;\n The main theme of this chapter is to about how companies throughout the world became huge, especially after the World War II. Huge companies could be managed only via hierarchies and bureaucracy. The author talks in depth about Max Weber, German sociologist who analyzed Western economies and wrote about bureaucracy and how it would lead to power being managed by big corporations.\nChapter 4\t: How Power Lost Its Edge: The More, Mobility, and Mentality Revolutions  \u0026ldquo;The decoupling of power from size, and thus the decoupling of the capacity to use power effectively from the control of a large Weberian bureaucracy, is changing the world.\u0026rdquo;\n  The More revolution - Overwhelming the means of control The Mobility revolution - The end of captive audiences The Mentality revolution - Taking nothing for granted anymore  Power and the three revolutions:\nChapter 5\t: Why Are Landslides, Majorities, and Mandates Endangered Species? The Decay of Power in National Politics  \u0026ldquo;Accordingly, the noble art of governing now depends more heavily on a much dirtier, hands-on skill: forming and maintaining a coalition.\u0026rdquo;\n The main theme of this chapter is the before and after contrast of the governments across the world - number of sovereign nations has quadrupled since 1945, democracies have increased, autocracies have gone down, there are more hung parliaments now, very few landslide victories, etc.\nChapter 6\t: Pentagons Versus Pirates: The Decaying Power of Large Armies Chapter 7\t: Whose World Will It Be? Vetoes, Resistance, and Leaks-or Why Geopolitics Is Turning Upside Down Chapter 8\t: Business as Unusual: Corporate Dominance Under Siege Chapter 9\t: Hyper-Competition for Your Soul, Heart, and Brain Chapter 10 : The Decay of Power: Is the Glass Half-Full or Half-Empty?

After a several sequences of twists and turns or crests and troughs of requirement/direction changes, the team is finally at the juncture where it has produced a product that the client wanted. The client has been involved in the process from the beginning, so nothing should be a surprise. Project delivery is also an opportunity to showcase the product to a broader audience than the immediate client that the team has been working on. Now comes the question of presenting the product to an audience that is not aware of the product yet. Worse, the audience may be very diverse in their technical or domain knowledge. How do we go about creating a presentation that appeals to all.\nA common rule of thumb for presentations is to go with the least common denominator in the audience who is significant enough. If the person with the least technical knowledge understands your framework, it is a win. There is always more hardwork in creating a simple presentation than a complex one. One usually starts by creating a presentation with all details in it and then stripping it slowly of the complexities layer by layer, in the end leaving only the most vital information that could be understood by all. After all, we’re investing time and energy, the audience is expecting to get something and if we disappoint, the ramifications could be disastrous. The audience may never come back even if the next product is stellar.\n_Figure 1: Image. Retrieved November 20, 2014.

The key is to find out what interested the audience in the beginning – is it curiosity, is it a joke that you told in the beginning ? Each audience is unique, so you would have to determine what works for a specific audience at that time. Whatever works, use that technique often so that you can bring the audience to a higher attention span than they normally would be in.\nAlso, always remember to keep the presentation simple and easy to remember.\nIf you’re successful, the audience will be engaged, they would have a good opinion about the product and also good knowledge about the product to make the right choices.\nReferences:   Reimold, P., \u0026amp; Reimold, C.

Remind yourself, \u0026ldquo;There is always enough time for the important things.\u0026rdquo; If it is important, you should be able to make time to do it. Continually look at ways of freeing up your time. Examine your old habits and search for ways to change or eliminate them. Try to use waiting time. Review notes or do practice problems. Keep paper or a calendar with you to jot down the things you have to do or notes to yourself. Examine and revise your lifetime goals on a monthly basis and be sure to include progress towards those goals on a daily basis. Put up reminders in your home or office about your goals. Always keep those long term goals in mind. Plan your day each morning or the night before and set priorities for yourself. Maintain and develop a list of specific things to be done each day, set your priorities and the get the most important ones done as soon in the day as you can. Evaluate your progress at the end of the day briefly. Look ahead in your month and try and anticipate what is going to happen so you can better schedule your time. Try rewarding yourself when you get things done as you had planned, especially the important ones. Do first things first.

The lingering question in the mind is “What if what we are presenting is different from what the Client is expecting?”. This happens in spite of the best documentation, design, execution and testing. Even projects that go into meticulous details of documenting every single requirement might in the end come to delivering something that the client is not expecting. Many times the client’s mindset changes, environment changes, technologies change.\nThe picture below depicts a very common joke in programming circles –\n_Figure 1 : Image Retrieved, Nov 14, 2014. From: [http://www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/2648](http://www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/2648)_ Multiple methodologies have been developed to counter this – more in software development than other domains since software is abstract and clients may not be able to envision it before it is created, the risk of not meeting the expectation is higher. Many times, clients might want a new functionality when they see the product for the first time !\nIt is precisely for this reason that Agile methodologies have become very popular in the last decade or so. Scrum and other frameworks have ensured that there is maximum transparency between the client and other stakeholders and the product under development. Frequent releases are done and client would be able to see the product and it evolves thereby having a chance to mould it in the right direction before having to say something after it is tool late.\nThe other aspect of handing off a project to a client is the sense of loss. As a person who has developed solutions for clients, I can personally vouch for this feeling. Here is a project that the team has worked on for months together and finally when it is handed over and knowledge transition is done, there is a feeling as though something precious is gone from hand to another owner who may not take care of it as you have done ! But effective documentation and good knowledge transition processes would ensure that the system does not get broken under the supervision of new team.\nA good reference for how to hand over a project could be an article written by Ben Ferris where he outlines different steps in the process –\n Picture the end product Make the Date Clear Documentation and Training Get the Sign Off Let It Go  Those 5 points are self-explanatory.

The current trend is that more companies are trying to recruit new grads. There was a time when companies would want only professionals. More the experience, more the degrees and certificates you had, more sought after you were. But that trend is changing. In an ever changing world, what is required is not someone who has deep expertise in a specific area but someone who can acquire skills fast.\nTop 5 skills according to me would be\n Ability to work in a team Ability to make decisions and prioritize work Ability to communicate well Technical competence in the domain that the company works in Domain knowledge and passion to work  Yes, technical competence is #4. I’d say that an intelligent person with strong fundamentals can pick up technology pretty fast. Also the technology landscape keeps changing and what is relevant today may not be so tomorrow. So a list of ‘hot technical skills’ today in 2014 may not be relevant to someone who might read this in the future.\nFrom my experience, the top technical skills are the following. They are not specific languages per se but areas that an average engineer should be aware of. So a Front end engineer who knows basics of deploying in the cloud, programming for mobile and take care of security would be greatly in demand.\nFrom my experience, the top technical skills are the following.

So a Front end engineer who knows basics of deploying in the cloud, programming for mobile and take care of security would be greatly in demand.\n  Front end web development – Long gone is the time when the meat of programming was done in the backend and front end was just a layer to show the data using HTML, JSP ..etc. Recent years have seen an explosion of front-end technologies and frameworks – HTML5, bootstrap.js ..etc have enabled smart engineers to create amazing web applications.\n  Mobile development – iOS or Android – E-commerce on mobile has been growing steadily and has outpaced web in many categories. With the advent of IPad and wearables, apps on devices make more money than corresponding websites. So this is a highly sought after skill.\n  Data Scientist / Analyst – Another area that is growing very fast is Machine learning and data mining. Companies are accumulating petabytes of user and item data and need to have intelligent systems to mine relevant information to recommend useful items to customers. So if there are engineers who know R language or Classification and clustering techniques, they are in high demand.\n  Cloud Computing – In today’s age, an average engineer is expected to know how to provision an Amazon EC2 instance and deploy code to it. Automating the process of provisioning and depoyment, creating an internal cloud, growing or reducing machine pool size on demand ..etc are key skill that are sought after.\n  Security – Computer security is another key area that is growing rapidly. Security in the cloud and mobile devices is a niche area at the moment. Every company now seeks engineers who know basics of security and also engineering who are experts in the area.\n  References:  Top IT Skills For 2014. (n.d.).

It was also impossible to think that we would have tools to reach over 100 million people within minutes. The power and the challenges are amazing.\nSocial media marketing industry report done by Social Media Examiner in 2013 came out with the following findings:\n Marketers place a very high value on social media: A significant 86% of marketers indicate that social media is important for their business, up from 83% in 2012. Tactics and engagement are top areas marketers want to master: At least 88% of marketers want to know the most effective social tactics and the best ways to engage their audience with social media. YouTube holds the top spot for future plans: A significant 69% of marketers plan on increasing their use of YouTube, making it the top area marketers will invest in for 2013. Marketers want to learn most about blogging: While 58% of marketers are blogging, 62% want to learn more about it and 66% plan on increasing blogging activities in 2013. Facebook and LinkedIn are two most important social networks for marketers. When forced to only select one platform, 49% of marketers selected Facebook, followed by LinkedIn at 16%. Most marketers aren’t sure their Facebook marketing is effective: Only 37% of marketers (slightly more than one in three) think that their Facebook efforts are effective. Increased exposure is the top benefit of social media marketing: significant 89% of marketers stated that increased exposure was the number- one benefit of social media marketing.  Figure 1: Image.

From: http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-industry-report-2013\nThere are clearly a lot of benefits of doing marketing through social media.\n So it makes practical sense to create a brand through social media that aligns with the way you want yourself to be perceived by others.\n There has never been a more important time to create and promote your self as your brand. You must take ownership of your profile and make it compelling, concise, and attractive. In fact, if you are serious about your career, you need to be keeping online profiles in LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. updated.\nThe diagram below shows the most commonly used social media platforms:\nFigure 2: Image. Retrieved October 30, 2014. From: http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-industry-report-2013\nSo, what can be done to improve your brand ?\nThis can be done in several stages:\n Identify the social media that you would focus on. Use the diagram above for help to decide. Once you have narrowed down the sites that you want to have your brand reflected, you need to modify your profile to make it more compelling. You can follow the steps outlined in the earlier blog post on LinkedIn. Thought it was only for LinkedIn, the same techniques can be applied to the other social media as well. Once you have a rock-solid profile, the next step is to master the connection process. You must strive to expand your network as much as possible. You should remember that connections are like a garden vine. If left unattended, it could destroy the garden! You should send updates to your profile as often as possible, which will in turn reach out to your networks’ home pages. The next step is to expand your network. Use your personal brand to create a circle of influence around the topics of your expertise.  If you keep practicing it, you will notice that your brand will improve, more people start taking notice and lot more opportunities come your way. One silver bullet solution may not work for everyone. Each needs to try out different methods, find the path that works best and keep iterating on improving the brand recognition and keeping a close eye on the benefits.\nReferences:   [1] Stelzner, M.

Employers and recruiters actively look at LinkedIn profiles either to find potential candidates that suit the role that they are looking for or to find out more about the person that they are interviewing. So it is very pertinent to look a little in-depth at what the site provides and how effectively it could be used.\nWhat does LinkedIn provide? LinkedIn’s remarkable value is making our second and third degree networks visible, as well as the connecting paths, thereby revealing the networks of people we know. Thus it helps in finding the right people using our connections. Here is a short summary of what LinkedIn provides:\n Provides an ability to find and identify the right people through 2nd and 3rd degree networks and connecting paths. Gives a platform to discover information that can help in a conversation, meeting or network event by reading the other person’s LinkedIn Profile beforehand. Helps in maintaining relationships with your network via personal messages, sharing ideas in Discussions and helping people out in Answers. Helps in getting Recommendations which are visible to anyone, but in particular to the people who are important in your job or for your goals. Provides a platform to receive introductions and referrals to the people who matter to you via the introduction tool or a regular email. Helps in discovering the relationships between people by looking at mutual connections. Raises your visibility, reputation, personal brand, and company brand via your LinkedIn Profile, your contributions in Answers and Discussions and on the web via search engines. Helps in “word of mouth publicity” by receiving Recommendations, or from people recommending you in Discussions or mentioning you as the expert in Answers. The platform sends notifications via Network Updates when someone changes jobs. This might be a good reminder to reconnect with them. Helps in picking up trends in the marketplace via Discussions. Assists in finding professional organizations to join, both online and offline, via Groups, and via people’s Profiles.  LinkedIn profile: Your LinkedIn profile is the page that people go to when they want to find out information about you. It means that many times, it is the first professional impression you make on someone. You need to make your profile relevant and highlight specific portions so that it increases your visibility, supports your personal branding and reputation.A good Profile increases your visibility on LinkedIn and also on the web. Google and other search engines index the information from your Public Profile on LinkedIn. Since LinkedIn has a high Page Ranking in Google the Profiles will also appear high in search results. If someone is not looking for you, but looking for a person with skills that you are expert at; a great LinkedIn profile will channel them to you.\nHow to market yourself by creating a great LinkedIn profile There are 5 portions of your profile that you need to focus on to create an attractive LinkedIn profile:\n Your “Teaser”: Picture, Name, Professional Headline, Location and Industry. Short Overview: Current \u0026amp; Past experience, Education, Recommendations, Connections, Websites, Twitter, and Public Profile. The Core: Summary and Specialties. The Specifics: Experience, Education, and Sections. The Details: Additional Information, Personal Information, and Contact Settings.  1. Teaser: Make sure that you provide a professional picture. Since there is not much space for photo, just focus on have a good photo of your face with the upper torso. Make sure that you provide a name that people can recognize you with. Do not give nicknames. Give a professional headline that tells something about your area of expertise. By default it is the current job title, but it is better to change it. Provide a location that indicates where you are working out of. Also provide the industry where you have your expertise.\n2. Short Overview: It is important to use “Current \u0026amp; Past Experience” section to help being found by former colleagues or by people searching for skills and roles that you have performed. Education is an important section where you could get found by people searching for alumni from specific schools or to connect with your former class or school mates. Recommendation is another powerful feature that you could use. Make it a habit to ask for recommendations, and provide recommendations for other people. Make it a point to have connections who know you or can recommend your skills. If you cannot have one of your connections give you introduction to another, it is not of much use. There is also a section that asks you about your websites and you can list up to 3 websites. Instead of the standard “Company website” or “Personal website”, choose “Other”and then write some compelling text. If you have a Twitter account, list it so that people can follow you. At this moment this feature exists on LinkedIn also. But if you are actively posting on Twitter, it makes sense to post Twitter link. Lastly, you must take care to see that you have a public profile URL that is not the standard undecipherable alpha-numeric string but a URL with your name it in. This is good for SEO.\n3. The Core: “Summary” is the place where you convey a lot of information about you in a very small area. It should not be too long or too short. The recommendation from Jon Vermeiren’s book “How to really use LinkedIn” is to use three blocks of text: information about the organization, some professional information about yourself, and some personal information. “Specialties” is the place to share the skills and knowledge you have accumulated in all your past jobs. This is the place to explain your expertise. You can put your certifications, knowledge of tools and programming languages, jargons, acronyms that are relevant to your industry here.\n4. The Specifics: The “Summary and Specialties” section has limited room. The Specifics section is where you describe in as much detail, your experience and education – including courses, projects, certifications, patents, organizations, etc.\n5. The Details: In this section you provide additional information related to your interests, groups that you belong to, honors and awards, personal information to reach you, etc.\nThe above steps need to be followed through on a periodic basis to ensure that the information does not get stale. Keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date is the best strategy to market yourself and present your best to the world.\nHow to expand your network: In their book “How to really use LinkedIn”, Vermeiren \u0026amp; Verdonck give 4 phases to building a foundation of your LinkedIn network.\n Phase 1: Upload your email contacts and connect with the ones already on LinkedIn. Phase 2: Find current and former colleagues and classmates and connect with them. Phase 3: Discover people you may know and connect with the ones you actually know. Phase 4: Promote your LinkedIn Profile with a LinkedIn Email Signature and LinkedIn Profile Badge for your website and blog.  Once you have done these, you have a solid foundation on which you can build your network. It is said that there are just 6 degrees of separation between everyone in the world and since LinkedIn gives you 3 degrees of connections, you can leverage it to reach any contact that you have in mind. The next logical step is to join Groups that are relevant to your area or work or expertise. Groups are a place to help others and be helped by them, to apply the Golden Triangle of Networking and to raise your Know, Like, and Trust factor. Once you participate in some groups and gain trust and establish your brand as someone who can answer questions on specific topics, you can start groups or become Group manager.\nThere are a lot of other strategies to network and improve your sphere of influence. As you use LinkedIn more, you would be able to effectively find more of your ‘target audience’ by doing specific searches, setting up alerts, browsing the connections of people in your network, browsing through LinkedIn recommendations of who to connect to, which groups to join, etc.\nReferences:   [1] Vermeiren, J., \u0026amp; Verdonck, B.

The topic of this blog is “Agile task lists, what does “done” mean in Agile?”.\nTeams change their methodology to agile with the lofty goal of getting great results but often fail. A primary reason for failure is the ambiguity around the definition of “done”. When what needs to be done in a User story is not clearly defined, what gets done does not fully meet end user requirements or even if it meets, might create technical debt. During the sprint planning, when the team discusses about the user story, everyone needs to make sure that the tasks required to complete the User Story is fully understood. If not, the scope would be inaccurate.\nOne way of listing down a task for the User Story is to go over a “done thinking grid“. A sample one is below:\nColumn 1: Make sure that the User Stories for a sprint are clear and understood by the team. Also make sure that the acceptance criteria are validated by the product owner. Make sure that the tasks for the Stories have been identified. Estimation will not be accurate if the tasks were not clearly understood by the team. Communicate build and package changes to the build master if you have one. Make sure that there is enough time for the product owner to sign off the User Stories after the User Acceptance Test. Also ensure that the features not done during the sprint are added back to the product backlog.\nColumn 2: Make sure that development, staging and production environment is ready with all tools and artifacts needed to complete the tasks at hand. Continuous integration, automation, test data, etc., need to be in place. Also, the Design needs to be complete. Lack of design may mean that the steps in the tasks have not been thought through. This situation is risky since it could result in scope creep or not being able to deliver on time. **Unit tests, documentation and pre-release builds need to be ready.\nColumn 3: Make sure that all the coding for features in the task list are done. “Code complete” implies that coding is done, unit testing is done, code re-factoring is done, bug fixes are done and the code is checked in.\nColumn 4: Make sure that automated code reviews, for e.g review by a tool like P.M.D for Java coding conventions are done. Every code that is written needs to be peer reviewed and approved. Check if code coverage metrics have been maintained. If the new code didn’t add tests, coverage might decrease. Check if the project metrics like burn-down chart are updated.\nColumn 5: Ensure that the product is fully tested before being released to production. Check if functional testing is completed. All kinds of automated and manual testing as per test cases need to be completed. Also make sure that Regression testing, Load and Performance testing and User Acceptance testing are done. After this mark the tasks as closed.\nSummary: Having one definition or checklist of “definition of done” is not practical since every project and organization is unique. Most teams go wrong with the “definition of done” in the initial stages of Agile. If the team is committed to learning from each sprint by earnestly doing Sprint retrospective, then gradually, they would get it right. Getting to a state of the ideal “definition of done” is key to delivering ship-able products that satisfy customer expectations.\nReferences:   [1] Gupta, M. (2008, September 3).

The topic of this blog is “Agile Sprint Retrospective”.\nOverview: Agile Sprint Retrospective is a meeting that happens after a Sprint to evaluate how the last one went. The Team, the Scrum Master and the Product Owner attends this meeting in Scrum. The objective of the meeting is to reflect on the current process and determine what steps could be taken to make corrections and adapt to future sprints.\nFigure 1 Sprint Meetings – Sprint Retrospective highlighted\nThe meeting starts with all the team members answering 2 questions –\nWhat went well during the last Sprint? What could be improved in the next Sprint?  In Scrum, the Scrum Master writes down the answers in summary form. Then everyone prioritizes in which order it wants to talk about improvements. Actionable items could be added to the next Sprint during the Sprint Grooming session as “Non-functional Requirements”.\nAdvantages of this meeting are as follows:\n It often exposes Organizational impediments Everyone gets clarity on what could be improved. Actionable steps can be taken towards better execution.  There are many impediments to having a good retrospective. Few of them are as follows:\n Lack of a proper environment where the members could speak their minds would mean that people could avoid bringing up uncomfortable issues. It is advisable for managers (who do performance evaluation) to be not present in the meeting. Lack of co-operation from everyone might make the retrospective life-less and stale with no constructive inputs to improve in the next iterations. Geographic distribution is another impediment. If everyone in the meeting is not face to face, the communication might cease to be fully transparent.  Scrum Masters employ a variety of techniques to get honest and transparent feedback from the team. Below are a few:\n Go around the table and ask 2 questions mentioned above. Silent writing: In this, the team is asked to write down feedback about the current process and submit. Satisfaction Histograms: Here the team given a survey of questions and asked to rate each on a satisfaction scale of 1 to 5.  In summary, the retrospective is a very good mechanism to keep the team agile and improve continuously. Scrum Master aims to get answers and compiles them into an actionable list. These are either put into the next sprint’s backlog or into the product backlog to be tackled later.\nReferences   [1] Schwaber, K. (2004). Appendix A. In Agile project management with Scrum.

The focus this week is on 2 things – The agile team and the artifacts that they work on, namely “backlogs”.\nAgile Team Agile team is a self contained team that can by itself complete a user story in the backlog. Let’s take the example of “Scrum” which is a popular Agile framework. In scrum, there could be dependencies with external teams. But it is up to the Scrum Master to resolve these dependencies. Otherwise, the team would flag such User Stories as having ‘impediments’ and move on to the next one.\nTypically a Scrum team consists of the following roles\n Scrum Master – Person who is in charge of the sprints Product Owner – Person who represents the stakeholders Team – Consists of different people who collectively have skills to complete tasks in the backlog.  Below is a short summary of responsibilities for each role.\nScrum Master:  Manages 1 sprint at a time Facilitates Sprint Planning, Review \u0026amp; Retrospective Finds and works to remove roadblocks Helps to motivate the team and keep them excited Protects team from outside distractions Facilitates communication between roles for every aspect of the project Responsible for keeping release/project information consolidated, organized and up to date Drives the cross-functional team at all levels Responsible for throughput Drives the execution of sprint items  Product Owner:  Responsible for market, business case, and competitive analysis Responsible for long and short term product vision Responsible for ROI and Net Profit Prioritizes features for releases based upon expected ROI Writes Acceptance Criteria Writes user stories Makes tradeoff decisions between scope and schedule  Team:  Responsible for implementation of the backlog items as per the acceptance criteria The team could contain people with specialized skills  Architect to define the design and ensure that best practices are followed. Developers to develop and unit test the features Quality engineers to test the features and ensure that they have been done as per the acceptance criteria User Experience Designers to take care of the human interaction perspective ..etc.    Backlog The product backlog in Scrum is a list of features that are desired for a product at that point in time. Features are short descriptions of the functionality that is needed and these are prioritized. They could contain new features, bugs, technical debt..etc. Typically a team picks few features from the top of the list during ‘Sprint Grooming’ sessions. During ‘Sprint Planning’, the product owner shows up with the prioritized list and the team take these, estimates and locks the features that could be accomplished in a sprint (called ‘Sprint backlog’).\nReferences   [1] – Sanders, A.

Like a bridge construction needed elaborate planning, design and construction, a software product went through a “waterfall” model of requirement definition, design, development, testing and release, with each phase occurring one after another.\nBut the cookie cutter approach failed for big software products which ended up creating products and systems that user didn’t have in mind or didn’t want anymore or became obsolete because the technology had changed. This is where Agile methodology comes into light.\nWhat is Agile?  Agile software development is a group of software development methods in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It is a conceptual framework that focuses on frequently delivering small increments of working software.\n Short History A small group of people got together in 2001 to discuss their feelings that the traditional approach to managing software development projects was failing far too often, and there had to be a better way.\nThey came up with the agile manifesto[1], which describes 4 important values that are as relevant today as they were then. It says,\nAgile Manifesto We value:\n Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan  Though incremental practices have been in existence since late 1950’s[2], the ‘Agile Manifesto’ ushered in a new era of focus on lightweight-iterative development. The Agile Manifesto is based on twelve principles[3] :\nAgile Principles  Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software Welcome changing requirements, even late in development Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months) Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location) Working software is the principal measure of progress Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential Self-organizing teams Regular adaptation to changing circumstances  Agile development provides opportunities to assess the direction of the project and to evaluate the end product at very early stages. This is achieved through regular cadences of work, known as Sprints or iterations, at the end of which teams must present a potentially shippable product increment. At the beginning of every sprint, the team does a “Sprint Planning” session where it pulls requirements from the top of a “backlog”, estimates the effort and determines if they can be accomplished during the sprint or not. The requirements are in the form of “User Stories” which is a high level definition of a feature being built for an end user. We’ll talk about User Stories in detail in the next section.\nUser Stories A user story is a short, simple statement of a requirement from the perspective of the end user of a system.\nIt typically follows this structure :\n As a “type of user”, I want “some goal” so that “some reason”.\n A user story is a very high-level definition of a requirement, containing just enough information so that the developers can produce a reasonable estimate of the effort to implement it. User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes, stored in a shoe box, and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate planning and discussion. As such, they strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them. In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written.\nTypically, if an index card is used, a user story might contain the following – User story summary (in the format mentioned above), priority and estimate on one side of the card and acceptance criteria on the other side.\nAll the user stories of a release are sorted in the order of priority in the “Release backlog”. Stories from the top of the pile are taken and a “Sprint backlog” is created for every sprint during the “Sprint Planning” meeting. At the end of every sprint, the team presents a potentially shippable product increment which is demoed during the “Sprint Review” at the end of the sprint. Details about the workflow of an Agile Sprint and related meetings would be the subject of another blog post.\nEpics Epics are large user stories, typically ones which are too big to implement in a single iteration and therefore they need to be dis-aggregated into smaller user stories at some point. Epics are typically lower priority user stories because once the epic works its way towards the top of the work item stack.\nUser Stories in the backlog\nConclusion We looked at how agile methodologies took shape, what agile is, a high level overview of the development life-cycle using agile and also looked in depth into one of key artifacts of agile – “User Stories” .\nReferences :  [1] Beck, Kent; et al.

Compression - prototypes are used when data objects are similar and loss is acceptable. Efficiently finding nearest neighbors - use prototypes to reduce number of pairwise distance computations.    8.1 Overview\n 8.1.1 What is Cluster Analysis  Defined above. Groups data objects based only on information found in the data that describes the objects and their relationships. Notion of a cluster is ambiguous Classification is \u0026ldquo;Supervised Classification\u0026rdquo; and Cluster analysis is \u0026ldquo;Unsupervised Classification\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Segmentation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Partitioning\u0026rdquo; are also sometimes synonymous with Clustering   What is not Cluster Analysis  Supervised Classification Simple segmentation Results of a query Graph partitioning   8.1.2 Different types of Clusterings  Hierarchical vs Partitional  Hierarchical (nested) - leaves are singletons Partitional (unnested) - non overlapping subsets   Exclusive vs Overlapping vs Fuzzy  Exclusive - assign each object to a single cluster Overlapping - objects can simultaneously belong to more than one cluster Fuzzy - every object belongs to every cluster with a membership weight between 0(absolutely doesn\u0026rsquo;t belong) and 1(abs belongs)  caveat : it doesn\u0026rsquo;t address true multi-class situations since the weights need to add up to 1.     Complete vs Partial  Complete - assigns every object to a cluster Partial - doesn\u0026rsquo;t assign every object to a cluster   Heterogeneous vs Homogeneous   8.1.3 Different types of Clusters  Well Separated - any point in a cluster is closer (more similar) to every other point in the cluster than to any point not in the cluster. Can have any shape. Prototype based (center based) - an object in a cluster is closer (more similar) to the “center” of a cluster, than to the center of any other cluster.  for data with continuous attributes, center is often the centroid. when centroid is not meaningful (data with categorical attributes), centre is often the medoid. tends to be globular.   Graph based - group of objects that are connected to one another but have no connection to objects outside the group. (Connected Components)  Contiguity-based - 2 objects are connected only if they are within a specified distance of each other. Useful when clusters are irregular or intertwined. Clique - another example of graph based cluster.   Density based - a cluster is a dense region of objects that is surrounded by a region of low density. Used when clusters are irregular or intertwined and when noise and outliers are present. Shared property (conceptual clustering) - Finds clusters that share some common property or represent a particular concept. Objective function - Finds clusters that minimize or maximize an objective function.   Characteristics of Input data  Type of proximity/density measure Sparseness Attribute Type Type of data Dimensionality Noise and Outliers Type of Distribution   Clustering Algorithms  K-means - prototype based, partitional clustering technique - finds k clusters represented by their centroids. Hierarchical Clustering - leaves are singletons, top down or bottom up. DBSCAN - density based, partial that produces a partitional clustering. number of clusters is automatically determined by the algorithm.      8.2 K-means\n Partitional clustering technique in which each cluster is associated with a centroid and each point is assigned to a cluster with the closest centroid. Number of clusters K, must be given as input. 8.2.1 The basic K-means algorithm  Initial centroids are often chosen randomly. The centroid is generally the mean of the points in the cluster Closeness is measured by Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, correlation ..etc. Most of the convergence happens the first few iterations Complexity is O(I * K * m * n) Assigning points to the closest centroid - Manhattan(L1) distance can be used for Euclidean data, Jaccard measure for document data Centroids and Objective function - e.g for objective function : minimize the squared distance of each point to its closest centroid. Data in Euclidean space - Objective function used is SSE(Sum of Squared Error) also known as \u0026lsquo;scatter\u0026rsquo;.  where dist is the standard Euclidean (L2) distance b/w objects. Centroid that minimizes the SSE of a cluster is the mean Given 2 different sets of clusters, we prefer one with lower SSE.   Document data  represented as a DTM(document term matrix) objective is to maximize similarity of the objects in the cluster to cluster centroid. The analogous quantity to SSE is \u0026lsquo;total cohesion\u0026rsquo;   The General case  There are many choices for the proximity function, centroid and objective function that can be used in basic k-means algorithm and that are guaranteed to converge. Bregman divergence includes squared Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance and cosine similarity.   Choosing initial centroids  Eg. 1 - Poor initial centroids : Randomly selected initial centroids may provide sub-optimal clustering with a higher SSE. Eg. 2 - Limits of random initialization If there are K \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; clusters, chance of selecting one centroid from each is very small.   Solutions to Initial centroids problem  Perform multiple runs  One way to minimize the effect or a poor random initial choice of centroids is to perform multiple runs. But this also need not give optimal clustering. If a centroid falls between a pair of clusters, it will be stuck there by making one cluster out of 2.   Use hierarchical clustering on a sample  One effective approach to counter the limitations of random poor initial centroids is to take a sample of points and cluster them using hierarchical clustering technique and use those centroids as initial centroids. But this is practical only if sample is relatively small and k is small compared to sample size.   Iterative approach  Select first point at random (or take centroid of all points) for each successive initial centroid, select a point that is farthest from the previously selected centroids. the downside is that this could select outliers.   Select more than K centroids Post processing Bisecting K-means   Time and Space complexity  Storage required : O((m + K)n) , m = number of points, n = number of attributes Time required : O(I * K * m * n) , I = number of iterations     8.2.2 K-means: Additional issues  Handling empty clusters  Basic K-means algo can yield empty clusters. Choose a replacement otherwise SSE will be large Approach 1 : Choose a replacement point that is farthest from any current centroid Approach 2 : Choose a replacement point from the centroid that has highest SSE. This would split the cluster and reduce overall SSE.   Outliers  If there are outliers, centroids may not be as representative as they ought to be and SSE would be higher as well. One approach is to discover outliers and eliminate them beforehand. But there could be situations where outliers are important (compression, financial data) Another approach is to identify outliers during pre-processing. Identify points with high contributions to SSE. Also we could eliminate small clusters   Reducing the SSE with post processing  One way to reduce SSE is to increase number of clusters (larger K). 2 strategies that decrease SSE by increasing K are -  Split a cluster - Choose a cluster with largest SSE or largest standard deviation for an attribute. Introduce a new centroid - One approach is to choose a point farthest from any cluster center. Another is to choose a point at random.   2 strategies that decrease K and try to minimize the SSE increase are -  Disperse a cluster - removing a centroid and assigning the points to other clusters. Disperse a cluster that doesn\u0026rsquo;t contribute much to the total SSE. Merge 2 clusters - Clusters with closest centroids are usually chosen. Strategy is same as that used in hierarchical clustering. Commonly used approach is to alternate cluster splitting and merging phases.     Updating centroids incrementally  In the basic K-means algorithm, centroids are updated after all points are assigned to a centroid. An alternative is to update the centroids after each assignment (incremental approach). Each assignment updates 0 or 2 centroids. Pros  Guarantees that empty clusters are not produced. Relative weights may be adjusted. Better accuracy and faster convergence are possible if weights are used.   Cons:  It is more expensive Introduces an order dependency (clusters produced depends on the order in which points are processed) . Although this can be overcome by randomizing the order.       8.2.3 Bisecting K-means  A straightforward extension of the basic K-means algorithm that is based on a simple idea: to obtain K clusters, split the set of all points into two clusters, select one of these clusters to split, and so on, until K clusters have been produced. There are different ways to choose which cluster to split, say using size or SSE. Usually the the clusters are refined by using the resulting centroids as initial centroids for basic k-means algorithm. This is useful since during bisecting k-means we\u0026rsquo;re using k-means algorithm \u0026lsquo;locally\u0026rsquo; Bisecting K-means is less susceptible to initialization problems. Also we can use bisecting k-means for hierarchical clustering.   8.2.4 K-means and different types of clusters  K-means has difficulty in detecting natural clusters when clusters have non-spherical shapes or widely different sizes or densities. This could be overcome if the user is willing to increase K and have more clusters. So a cluster might have many sub clusters.   8.2.5 Strengths and weaknesses  Strengths : Used for wide variety of data types, Very efficient Weaknesses : Cannot handle non-globular clusters, not good with data that has outliers.   8.2.6 K-means as an optimization problem  Gradient descent - involves picking an initial solution and then repeating the fol- lowing two steps: compute the change to the solution that best optimizes the objective function and then update the solution. Derivation of K-means as an algorithm to minimize the SSE (sum of squared errors): Proof that the best centroid for minimizing the SSE of a cluster is the mean of the points in the cluster. Derivation of K-means for SAE (sum of absolute errors) : Ck is the median of the cluster.      8.3 Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering\n 2 approaches of hierarchical clustering -  Agglomerative - Start with the points as individual clusters and, at each step, merge the closest pair of clusters. Divisive - Start with one, all-inclusive cluster and, at each step, split a cluster until only singleton clusters of individual points remain.   Often displayed graphically using a tree-like diagram called dendogram, which displays sub-cluster relationships and also the order in which the clusters were merged. Don\u0026rsquo;t have to assume any particular number of clusters. May correspond to meaningful taxonomies. 8.3.1 Basic Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm  Key operation is the computation of proximity Defining proximity b/w clusters  Cluster proximity is typically defined with a particular type of cluster in mind. For example, many agglomerative hierarchical clustering techniques, such as MIN, MAX, and Group Average, come from a graph-based view of clusters.   Time and Space complexity  Proximity matrix requires the storage of 1/m^2 proximities. The space needed to keep track of the clusters is proportional to the number of clusters. Hence, the total space complexity is O(m^2). There are m steps and at each step the size, m^2, proximity matrix must be updated and searched. So time complexity is O(m^3). It can be reduced to O(m^2 log m) by keeping the data in a sorted list or heap     8.3.2 Specific Techniques of similarity measures  MIN (single link)  Similarity of two clusters is based on the two most similar (closest) points in the different clusters. Determined by one pair of points, i.e., by one link in the proximity graph. Strength : Can handle non-eliptical shapes. Weakness : Sensitive to noise and outliers.   MAX (complete link)  Similarity of two clusters is based on the two least similar (most distant) points in the different clusters. Determined by all pairs of points in the two clusters. Strength : Less susceptible to noise and outliers Weakness : Tends to break large clusters, Biased towards globular clusters   Group Average  Proximity of two clusters is the average of pairwise proximity between points in the two clusters. Compromise between Single and Complete Link Strength : Less susceptible to noise and outliers Weakness : Biased towards globular clusters   Ward\u0026rsquo;s method  Similarity of two clusters is based on the increase in squared error when two clusters are merged. Similar to group average if distance between points is distance squared. Hierarchical analogue of K-means – Can be used to initialize K-means. Strength : Less susceptible to noise and outliers Weakness : Biased towards globular clusters   Distance between centroids : Similarity of two clusters is based on the distance between the centroids in the different clusters.   8.3.3 The Lance-Williams formula for Cluster Proximity  A general formula for expressing hierarchical clustering proximity Any of the cluster proximities that we have discussed above can be viewed as a choice of different parameters in the Lance-Williams formula   8.3.4 Key Issues in Hierarchical clustering  Lack of a global objective function : It is greedy technique in which optimization is done locally at that specific moment. Ability to handle different cluster sizes : In order to take care of the relative sizes of the clusters that are merged, we could take weights into account.  UPGMA - Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages. WPGMA - Weighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages.   Merging decisions are final: Once the decision is made, it cannot be undone at a later time.   8.3.5 Strengths and Weaknesses : Already discussed above.    8.4 DBSCAN\n Density-based clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. DBSCAN is a simple and effective density-based clustering algorithm. 8.4.1 Traditional Density: Center-based approach  In the center-based approach, density is estimated for a particular point in the data set by counting the number of points within a specified radius, Eps, of that point. This includes the point itself. Classification of Points According to Center-Based Density  Core point: A point is a core point if it has more than a specified number of points (MinPts) within Eps. Border point: A border point has fewer than MinPts within Eps, but is in the neighborhood of a core point. Noise point: A noise point is any point that is neither a core point nor a border point.     8.4.2 The DBSCAN algorithm  Time and Space complexity  The basic time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm is O(m × time to find points in the Eps-neighborhood), where m is the number of points. In the worst case, this complexity is O(m^2). If a different data structure is used, it could be as low as O(m logm). The space requirement is O(m).   Selection of DBSCAN Parameters  The big question for DBSCAN is \u0026ldquo;how to determine the parameters Eps and MinPts ?\u0026rdquo; The basic approach is to look at the behavior of the distance from a point to its kth nearest neighbor(k-dist). Usually points within cluster will have small k-dist and noise points will have large k-dist. So if we compute the k-dist for all the data points for some k, sort them in increasing order, and then plot the sorted values, we expect to see a sharp change at the value of k-dist that corresponds to a suitable value of Eps.   Clusters of Varying Density  DBSCAN can have trouble with density if the density of clusters varies widely. If the Eps threshold is low and if the densities vary, the denser clusters will be picked up and the dilute ones might be categorized as noise.     8.4.3 Strengths and Weaknesses  Strengths  Resistant to Noise Can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes   Weaknesses  Doesn\u0026rsquo;t work well for clusters with varying densities Doesn\u0026rsquo;t work well for High-dimensional data        8.5 Cluster Evaluation\n For supervised classification we have a variety of measures to evaluate how good our model is – Accuracy, precision, recall For cluster analysis, the analogous question is \u0026ldquo;how to evaluate \u0026lsquo;the goodness\u0026rsquo; of the resulting clusters?\u0026rdquo; The difficulty - Many times clustering is done as part of exploratory data analysis. So validation may not be needed. Also, different clustering algorithms might need different evaluation techniques - SSE might be suited for K-means but not for DBSCAN. 8.5.1 Overview  Aspects of Cluster Validation  Determining the clustering tendency of a set of data, (distinguishing whether non-random structure actually exists in the data). Determining the correct number of clusters. Evaluating how well the results of a cluster analysis fit the data without reference to external information. Comparing the results of a cluster analysis to externally known results, such as externally provided class labels. Comparing two sets of clusters to determine which is better.   Items 1, 2, and 3 do not make use of any external information - they are unsupervised techniques - while item 4 requires external information. Item 5 can be performed in either a supervised or an unsupervised manner. The evaluation measures (indices), that are applied to judge various aspects of cluster validity are traditionally classified into the following three types -  Unsupervised (Internal indices) -  Measures the goodness of a clustering structure without referring to external information. e.g SSE Further divided into 2 classes - measures of cluster cohesion, cluster separation   Supervised (External indices)  Measures the extent to which the clustering structure discovered by a clustering algorithm matches some external structure. e.g Entropy (measures how well cluster labels match externally supplied class labels)   Relative  Compares different clusterings or clusters e.g Two K-means clusterings can be compared using either the SSE or entropy.       8.5.2 Unsupervised Cluster Evaluation Using Cohesion and Separation  Cluster validity for a set of K clusters is a weighted sum of the validity of individual clusters. The validity function can be cohesion, separation or some combination of these. The weights will vary depending on the validity measure. For cohesion, higher values are better, for separation, lower values are better. Graph-Based View of Cohesion and Separation  Cohesion of a cluster = sum of the weights of the links in the proximity graph that connect points within the cluster. Separation between two clusters = sum of the weights of the links from points in one cluster to points in the other cluster. The proximity function can be a similarity, a dissimilarity, or a simple function of these quantities   Prototype-Based View of Cohesion and Separation  Cohesion of a cluster = sum of the proximities with respect to the prototype (centroid or medoid) of the cluster. Separation between two clusters = proximity of the two cluster prototypes. There are two measures for separation because, the separation of cluster prototypes from an overall prototype is sometimes directly related to the separation of cluster prototypes from one another   Overall Measures of Cohesion and Separation  The previous measures (cohesion \u0026amp; separation) can be combined into an overall measure of cluster validity by using a weighted sum.   Relationship between Prototype-Based Cohesion and Graph-Based Cohesion  For some proximity measures, the measures of cohesion and separation are equivalent for Graph-based and prototype-based approaches even though they seem distinct. For instance, for the SSE and points in Euclidean space, it can be shown that the average pairwise distance between the points in a cluster is equivalent to the SSE of the cluster   Two Approaches to Prototype-Based Separation  When proximity is measured by Euclidean distance, the traditional measure of separation between clusters is the between group sum of squares (SSB), which is the sum of the squared distance of a cluster centroid. The higher the total SSB of a clustering, the more separated the clusters are from one another.   Relationship between Cohesion and Separation  In some cases there is a strong relationship b/w cohesion and separation. It is possible to show that the sum of the total SSE and the total SSB is a constant. Total sum of Squares (TSS) = sum of squares of the distance of each point to the overall mean of the data. TSS = SSE + SSB The importance of this result is that minimizing SSE (cohesion) is equivalent to maximizing SSB (separation).   Evaluating Individual Clusters and Objects  Many of the measures that we studied above can be used to evaluate individual clusters and objects. We could rank individual clusters according to their specific value of cluster validity (cohesion or separation) and make some observations - Since higher value of cohesion may be better than lower, we could decide to split a cluster with lower value. If separation between clusters is low, we could decide to merge the clusters. Objects that contribute more to the cohesion and separation are probably near the interior of the cluster and others are probably near the edge.   The Silhouette Coefficient  How to compute Silhouette coefficient  For the i th object, calculate its average distance to all other objects in its cluster. Call this value ai. For the i th object and any cluster not containing the object, calculate the object\u0026rsquo;s average distance to all the objects in the given cluster. Find the minimum such value with respect to all clusters; call this value bi. Silhouette coefficient, si = (bi − ai)/ max(ai, bi).   The value of the silhouette coefficient can vary between −1 and 1. When\n$a_i = 0, s_i = 1$     8.5.3 Unsupervised Cluster Evaluation Using the Proximity Matrix  Measuring Cluster Validity via Correlation  Input -\u0026gt; Similarity matrix for a data set and the cluster labels from a cluster analysis of the data set. Output -\u0026gt; Evaluate “goodness” of the clustering by looking at the correlation between the similarity matrix and the cluster labels. While computing the correlation, since the matrices are symmetric, only the correlation between n (n - 1) / 2 entries needs to be calculated. High correlation indicates that points that belong to the same cluster are close to each other.   Judging a Clustering Visually by Its Similarity Matrix  If we sort the rows and columns of the similarity matrix so that all objects belonging to the same class are together, then an ideal similarity matrix has a block diagonal structure. Well-separated clusters show a very strong, block- diagonal pattern in the reordered similarity matrix.   Computation of the proximity matrix takes O(m ^ 2) time   8.5.4 Unsupervised Evaluation of Hierarchical Clustering  Previous approaches are for paritional clusterings. Cophenetic correlation is a popular evaluation measure for hierarchical clusterings Cophenetic distance between two objects = Proximity at which an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique puts the objects in the same cluster for the first time. The CoPhenetic Correlation Coefficient (CPCC) is the correlation between the entries of the cophenic distance matrix and the original dissimilarity matrix and is a standard measure of how well a hierarchical clustering (of a particular type) fits the data.   8.5.5 Determining the Correct Number of Clusters  Plot SSE and Silhouette co-efficient for different values of k. Choose k where there is a distinct knee in the SSE and a distinct peak in the silhouette coefficient   8.5.6 Clustering Tendency  Clustering algorithms produce clusters for any input data. But can the data even be clustered ? One approach is to evaluate the resulting clusters and only claim that a data set has clusters if at least some of the clusters are of \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; quality. To make sure that the poor quality is not due to wrong choice of algorithm, we could use multiple algorithms and again evaluate the quality of the resulting clusters. Another approach is to try to evaluate whether a data set has clusters without clustering. Most common approach, especially for data in Euclidean space, has been to use statistical tests for spatial randomness   8.5.7 Supervised Measures of Cluster Validity  If we have external information about data, say in the form of class labels for the data objects, we could measure the degree of correspondence between the cluster labels and the class labels. We could have different approaches to measure the extent to which two objects that are in the same class are in the same cluster. There are 2 main approaches - classification oriented and similarity oriented. Classification-Oriented Measures of Cluster Validity  Uses measures from classification, such as entropy, purity, and the F-measure. These measures evaluate the extent to which a cluster contains objects of a single class. Entropy : The degree to which each cluster consists of objects of a single class Purity: Another measure of the extent to which a cluster contains objects of a single class. Precision : The fraction of a cluster that consists of objects of a specified class. Recall : The extent to which a cluster contains all objects of a specified class. F-measure : A combination of both precision and recall that measures the extent to which a cluster contains only objects of a particular class and all objects of that class.   Similarity-Oriented Measures of Cluster Validity  We can view this approach to cluster validity as involving the comparison of two matrices: (1) the ideal cluster similarity matrix discussed previously, which has a 1 if two objects are in the same cluster and 0 otherwise, and (2) an ideal class similarity matrix defined with respect to class labels, which has 1 if objects are in the same class and 0 otherwise. Rand statistic and Jaccard coefficient are two of the most frequently used cluster validity measures.   Cluster Validity for Hierarchical Clusterings  Supervised evaluation of a hierarchical clustering is more difficult for a variety of reasons, including the fact that a preexisting hierarchical structure often does not exist To evaluate a hierarchical clustering, we compute, for each class, the F-measure for each cluster in the cluster hierarchy. For each class, we take the maximum F- measure attained for any cluster. Finally, we calculate an overall F-measure for the hierarchical clustering by computing the weighted average of all per-class F-measures, where the weights are based on the class sizes.     8.5.8 Assessing the Significance of Cluster Validity Measures  How do we interpret the significance of the number given by a cluster evaluation technique ? Need to be aware of the basic definitions of evaluation measures used, like - a purity of 0 is bad, while a purity of 1 is good, an entropy of 0 is good, as is an SSE of 0. If we don\u0026rsquo;t have an absolute standard, a common approach is to interpret the value of our validity measure in statistical terms. e.g - plotting a histogram of SSE for random data sets.

Couldn\u0026rsquo;t go out because I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spread the flu around. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t watch TV or browse the net since eyes were hurting. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep because, I\u0026rsquo;d start coughing the moment I was in bed. So though of reading a book that I\u0026rsquo;d wanted to read for a couple of months. A had finished reading and told me the gist, but I wanted to read it too. So made some hot water, poured it into the flask and came upstairs to my room. Poured some hot water into a cup, opened a sachet of Emergen-C and eased myself on the beanbag with the book in one hand and cup in another. I was almost completely immersed into the book for almost two days. Slept a couple of times in the middle, refilled the cup with hot water almost mechanically, went down to have food ..etc but my mind was in the book and I completely forgot about everything else.\nGetting up after finishing the book was like going into a theatre and coming out. In fact he explains that going from \u0026lsquo;the realm of the Earthworm\u0026rsquo;s eye-view\u0026rsquo; to the gateway is like coming out to the welcoming warmth of a sunny summer afternoon after being in a dark theatre for couple of hours - that experience multiplied 1000 times.\nThere is much more to write but this is one of those books where a person has to either read and engage in conversation with another who has read.\nSome chapters had very good quotes at the beginning.

The passage at the beginning of this post is from the movie when Leonard Bast gets lost completely in what he is reading.\nWell, why \u0026ldquo;Tess \u0026quot; ? Why were we searching for Tess ? A was channel surfing and accidentally halted at a channel which was airing \u0026ldquo;Tess of d\u0026rsquo;Urbevilles - Part 1\u0026rdquo;. Sometimes I think my zeal to tell a story runs ahead of me and I tell the important points, mainly glorifying the best aspects beyond what they are. I\u0026rsquo;ve pumped so much of awe and mystery around my favourite novels, mostly \u0026ldquo;Kane and Abel\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Godfather\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Bourne Identity\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Atlas Shrugged\u0026rdquo; .. , that most of my friends did read them eventually. Sometimes I feel if you praise something so much, the person who is listening to you almost feels obliged to try that at least to make you happy.\nBut to be fair to her, she saw the movie for sometime and actually liked it. Luckily the channel did not air part 2 and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready to tell her the ending. Only mentioned that it was a tragedy.\nFor long, I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting her to read \u0026ldquo;The Return of the Native\u0026rdquo; (I think I\u0026rsquo;ve told her the story of the novel twice already) and other novels of Hardy.

Bright ones are usually flapping around the boat, within my hand’s reach at anytime. But this one was almost in the water. Ah! May be the wind carried it down. It twisted and turned. Turned and twisted. It stood there for a moment, mustering all its strength to defy gravity, hoping that the eastern wind would carry it to me. But it met its end, the frail paper and its seven colors. It touched water. Did it shiver? It floated for a brief second and faded.. into the blueness of the sea.

They take birth everyday, the rainbow butterflies. When the dawn breaks I see them fluttering around my boathouse so energetically. They are of a million colors. Strange hues that I don’t even know the names of. May be A might know. She knows so many things, so many strange esoteric secrets. When is she coming on to this boat ? I’ve made so much of space for her. Right out of nowhere I tell you. It is just magic.  Sometimes I wonder if they are new ones or the old ones reborn. I wish I could hold on to each one of them before they’re lost. At least then, I’d know whether they are new. But they make everyday colorful. A beautiful colorful day – may be that’s all that matters.  A loves them, these rainbow butterflies. I’ve stuck some of the beautiful ones to our Sycamore Tree. She’s stuck hers too. No wonder the tree is more colorful than green. And what more, it looks different from every angle. And it makes our island look different.  I wish I hadn’t lost them. My dear rainbow butterflies. Now I know, it was my preoccupation with the fishes that cost me my rainbow butterflies. I made bigger nets and cast them wider to catch bigger fishes. Now I begin to wonder, are the fishes taking revenge? Are they eating the rainbow butterflies that I gave up to the sea ? Are they conspiring with the sea and the winds to gobble up my rainbow butterflies?  What do I do ?  Do I fight the fishes ? Or safeguard my rainbow butterflies ?  Do I make bigger and bigger and bigger nets and capture all the fishes so that they might let my rainbow butterflies be ? Or stop catching the fishes and tend to my rainbow butterflies ?

It could be a library, a church, a temple, top of a mountain, a beach, an island, a hut in the middle of a forest, a river bank .. it could even be someone’s house.  S’s house, it’s not a house, it is a being. The moment you enter, you feel a warm, smooth embrace. There is certainly something there.. something in the way the house was built, something in the way things were arranged, something in the way lighting was set up, something that kept you suspended in a dream-like state.  The flute at the shelf near the bottom of the stairs was lazily placed but you felt as though it blew music into your mind. The winding stairs that led to a small study upstairs beckoned you to go up and when you did, it wasn’t merely going up in space, you felt as though you were elevated to a higher state.. you floated into heaven.  In the small study upstairs, the books on the shelf didn’t seem like sad children who were forcefully disciplined to stand at attention.. they seemed rather relaxed and smiling, leaning on each other, beckoning you to hold and touch and feel and experience.  You might end up standing there forever, wishing that the moment never went away..  But if you did, you’d miss the patio and the overlooking swimming pool and the painting stand by the side.

The main protagonist undergoes an eye operation where she is made to put on a pair of blue lenses before the actual lenses. She begins to see everyone strangely – all humans with animal heads and human bodies. One nurse has kitten’s head, the doc is a terrier, sis nancy is a snake. First she thinks it is a joke but she realizes it is not. She mentions this and gets varied responses. Mostly others are offended.\nIf you perceive something/someone as bad, should you tell them ? Is it because they’ve suddenly metamorphosed into something bad or your outlook has changed ?\nHeader Image - \u0026ldquo;Morning Calmness - San Francisco bay bridge\u0026rdquo; by David Yu via Flickr.\n","description":"","id":76,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"The Blue Lenses","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2007-04-19-the-blue-lenses/"},{"content":"There are many books that when I think back on them, I have this lingering feeling that either due to reading quickly or not taking notes, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really take in the full essence of the book. There is more to be understood and when there is time, I need to get back to it. \u0026ldquo;7 Habits of Highly Effective People\u0026rdquo; by Steven Covey is one such book. My classmate from school, RR, was probably the first person to recommend the book to me. I have probably read the first chapter at least 5 or 6 times before I finally was able to finish reading the book around 2002 when I was working in Chennai. This is the second time I\u0026rsquo;ve read this book.\nIt is one of those books which the moment you finish reading, you will feel inspired, to do more, to yearn to lead a more fulfilling life. You will see the world in a new perspective with a feeling within you that things are more in your control than not.\nPART 1 - Paradigms and principles  Inside-out   \u0026ldquo;There is no real excellence in all this world which can be separated from right living.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\n~ David Starr Jordan\n  The Seven Habits : an overview   \u0026ldquo;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\u0026rdquo;\n~ Aristotle\n PART 2 - Private victory Habit 1 - Be Proactive - Principles of personal vision\n \u0026ldquo;I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.\u0026rdquo;\n~ Henry David Thoreau\n Be proactive and have control over the outcomes rather than being reactive to everything around you.\nHabit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind- Principles of personal leadership\n \u0026ldquo;What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.\u0026rdquo;\n~ Oliver Wendell Holmes\n Always visualize the end before starting something and this habit will help you focus better towards the goal.\nHabit 3 - Put First Things First - Principles of personal management\n \u0026ldquo;Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.\u0026rdquo;\n~ Goethe\n Once you begin with end in mind and start implementing things, prioritize so that you always put most important things first.\nPART 3 - Public victory - Paradigms on interdependence Habit 4 - Think Win-Win - Principles of interpersonal leadership\n \u0026ldquo;There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity.\u0026rdquo; ~ Samuel Johnson\n\u0026ldquo;We have committed the Golden Rule to memory; let us now commit it to life.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; ~ Edwin Markha\n Most things in life don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a zero sum game. Win-Win is based on the assumption that there is plenty for everyone, and that success follows a co-operative approach more naturally than the confrontation of win-or-lose.\nHabit 5 - Seek First to Understand and then to be Understood - Principles of empathic communication\n \u0026ldquo;The heart has its reasons which reason knows not of.\u0026rdquo; ~ Pascal\n Habit 6 - Synergize - Principles of creative cooperation\n \u0026ldquo;I take as my guide the hope of a saint in crucial things, unity \u0026ndash; in important things, diversity \u0026ndash; in all things, generosity\u0026rdquo;\n~ Inaugural Address of President George Bush\n Synergy means that 1 + 1 may equal 8, 16, or even 1,600.\nPART 4 - Renewal Habit 7 - Sharpen the Saw - Principles of balanced self-renewal\n \u0026ldquo;Sometimes when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things\u0026hellip;.

The world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by changing their environment.

There was brightness everywhere, almost blinding him. He could see the rays going away – far away to distant lands, giving light, feeding happiness.\nBut he couldn’t stand there for long. Some strong force was pulling him away. He clenched his teeth, tightened his muscles, held his fists in a tight grip, He tried .. to hold on for longer. It broke. But he wasn’t ready to give away, not yet. He leapt, stretched his hand and grasped a light ray. In a moment he wasn’t himself. As the luminous shaft shot ahead with break neck speed, his vision became blurred, he ceased to think.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was far away. He was still riding on the light ray. But there was no sun, no planets in the vicinity. It was mostly dark. At a distance he could see specks of light from stars, light years away. He could feel that he wasn’t traveling as fast as he was in the beginning. Was the ray weakening ? A dread swept through him. What would happen ? Would the light die leaving him in groping in the darkness ? Without being able to see something, to hold somewhere ?\nIt came back suddenly! The talk. That was a different time, a different age, a different place. SN was talking.\n\u0026ldquo;You can see light only when it hits some object – say dust, and gets reflected. If there was no dust, no matter, i.e if there were only vacuum here, we wouldn’t see light. So, actually the universe is full of light. We cannot see it because of vacuum. In vacuum, light travels till infinity. It never reduces, never falters.\u0026rdquo;\nHe looked down. The light ray he was traveling on, it wasn’t there ! It struck him then, there are infinite rays of light around. He just couldn’t see them. He reached his hand above and felt another ray. He jumped on to it.

It’s as though you’ve been awake all along but had just closed your eyes temporarily..\nToday was one of those ‘some other’ days.\nIt was a holiday but I just got up and immediately wanted to check out ‘the destruction of Sennacherib’. I wanted to read the Biblical passage which mentioned this incident.\nThis out-of-ordinary behavior was because just yesterday I started with this book named \u0026ldquo;Familiar Poems, Annotated\u0026rdquo; by Asimov.\nFor starters, Isaac Asimov was a master science fiction writer, the most famous in his time and the best of them all. He was a child prodigy who started writing books at the age of 7 and has written books on almost topics .. even Bible \u0026amp; Shakespeare.\n\u0026ldquo;Familiar Poems..\u0026rdquo; is not just another compilation of poems. It is a glimpse into the times.. into history. The poems are arranged chronologically. After each poem he gives a backdrop.. So when you read the poem, read the description and once again read the poem, you don’t see beautiful words strung brilliantly to produce rhythm and rhyme but the play .. the actual scene being enacted right in front of your eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;The destruction ..\u0026rdquo; was the second poem , Ozymandias being the first.\nSo I got up ..\nreached under the cot for the laptop \u0026amp; specs..\ngoogled..\n2 Kings Ch 18 \u0026amp; 19. The Bible says 18,500 people were dead .\n\u0026quot;Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green, That host with their banners at sunset were seen: Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown, That host on the morrow lay withered and strown. For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast, And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed: And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill, And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still! \u0026quot;  I finished reading it .. also read the wikipedia article about it. It said that the biblical account was one sided and actually Judah had lost to the Assyrian King. Whatever !\nCame out of the room and found that T and his friends were almost ready .. his friends had come from different places in the US to visit the west coast and he was kind of taking them around. They were going to San Francisco today.\nSince I’m a sleep-early (actually sleep-more) kind of a chap, and they came over pretty late, I never got to speak to them. Thought I’d get acquainted in the morning and now they were about to leave..\nTheir departure set me thinking .. Did they eat anything in the morning? Gosh ! May be I should’ve asked them if they wanted to have something ! Frozen Idiappam ?\nNah ! People brought up in Kerala usually don’t brighten up so much when they hear ‘idiappam’/ ‘kappa’ / ‘aluva’ ..etc in comparison to those brought up outside.. Well! there was nothing much to eat anyway !\nWhen you’re staying as a bachelor and when friends’s friends usually drop in .. you kind of lose the host-guest feeling .. You’d slowly tend to stop worrying about such things.. bachelorhood..decadence of social skills ?\nThat’s ok.. Things can only get better in future..\nHad breakfast ..\nSaw the spelling bee contest .. Gee!! how do these small kids know the spellings of all those difficult words. amazing !\nWatched soccer.. I was routing for Germany and they lost ! 2 – 0 . Whatta disgrace .\nWent to San Francisco in the evening to see Independence day fireworks.\nWe could see them only from far. So didn’t enjoy it as much as the new year fireworks.\nBut the number of people ! There were so many.

Over a span of 3 centuries, thousands of brilliant and hardworking men and women were at it.. and in the quest had discovered so many ground-breaking theories ..even new branches of Maths!\nI was just dumbfounded the moment I read it - at the sheer truth behind it. Here it goes ..\n \"Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. You go into the first room and it's dark, completely dark. You stumble around, bumping into the furniture. Gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture is. And finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch and turn it on. Suddenly, it's all illuminated and you can see exactly where you were. Then you enter the next room . . . \" Exactly !! I think this applies to most situations in life! I’ve been in this groping-in-the-dark-what-do-I-do-next state so many times !\nMay be that’s the joy of teaching.. you see someone groping in the dark and help him/her to the switch and when the room lightens up .. the look on the bright face..that look is the bliss of teaching. And vice versa.. anyone’d be really happy to be with a person who ‘knows’!\nThere are so many mathematicians mentioned in the book.. Euler.. Gauss .. Galois .. Sophie Germain .. I can see them all..as though they spent their lives on earth just recently. Whatever was written about Gauss in the book, I already knew.. even the story of his teacher giving the 7 yr old Gauss with a difficult monotonous problem like 1+2+3+..100 as punishment and him solving it in a couple of minutes ! Galois was a revelation .. I was reminded of Marlowe.\nA really bright star who came in, brightened the whole sky with brilliant blinding light , then swiftly disappeared.\nHe was so brilliant that he could solve most equations in his mind. In fact he couldn’t get into the most famous college at that time because he wrote the answers directly without intermediate steps. While still a schoolboy, he’d learnt all the higher level mathematical theories extant at that time and had developed the theory in his name – the Galois theory !\nGalois died in a political duel. The night before the duel.. he was so convinced he would die, that he wrote down his complete mathematical theory and sent it to his friend. At the time of his death, he was just 20!\nHeader Image - \u0026ldquo;Maison Fermat\u0026rdquo; by Karine C. via Flickr.\n","description":"","id":82,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"Fermat's Last Theorem - Amir Aczel","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2006-07-02-fermats-last-theorem/"},{"content":"Though sleeping, reading and watching movies were the only major things that I did during this weekend, what I really wanted to do was to go to a beach, write something, put it into a bottle and throw it into the sea.\nYeah !

Money is a tool of exchange, which can\u0026rsquo;t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?\nWhen you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor—your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money, Is this what you consider evil?\nHave you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions—and you\u0026rsquo;ll learn that man\u0026rsquo;s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.\nBut you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man\u0026rsquo;s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made—before it can be looted or mooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can\u0026rsquo;t consume more than he has produced.\nTo trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss—the recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your misery—that you must offer them values, not wounds—that the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men\u0026rsquo;s stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by trade—with reason, not force, as their final arbiter—it is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest ability—and the degree of a man\u0026rsquo;s productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider evil?\nBut money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality—the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind.\nMoney will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if he\u0026rsquo;s evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if he\u0026rsquo;s evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his money. Is this the reason why you call it evil?\nOnly the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth—the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil?\nMoney is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your money by fraud? By pandering to men\u0026rsquo;s vices or men\u0026rsquo;s stupidity? By catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your money will not give you a moment\u0026rsquo;s or a penny\u0026rsquo;s worth of joy. Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then you\u0026rsquo;ll scream that money is evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of money?\nMoney will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Money is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money?\nOr did you say it\u0026rsquo;s the love of money that\u0026rsquo;s the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. It\u0026rsquo;s the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money—and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.\nLet me give you a tip on a clue to men\u0026rsquo;s characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.\nRun for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper\u0026rsquo;s bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another—their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.\nBut money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich—will not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guilt—and of his life, as he deserves.\nThen you will see the rise of the men of the double standard—the men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money—the men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-law—men who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victims—then money becomes its creators\u0026rsquo; avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they\u0026rsquo;ve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.\nDo you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a society\u0026rsquo;s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion—when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing—when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors—when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don\u0026rsquo;t protect you against them, but protect them against you—when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice—you may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that is does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.\nWhenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men\u0026rsquo;s protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, \u0026lsquo;Account overdrawn.'\nWhen you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, \u0026lsquo;Who is destroying the world? You are.\nYou stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why it\u0026rsquo;s crumbling around you, while you\u0026rsquo;re damning its life-blood—money. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout men\u0026rsquo;s history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slaves—slaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebody\u0026rsquo;s mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepers—as industrialists.\nTo the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a country of money—and I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, man\u0026rsquo;s mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human being—the self-made man—the American industrialist.\nIf you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choose—because it contains all the others—the fact that they were the people who created the phrase \u0026lsquo;to make money.\u0026rsquo; No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity—to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted of obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words \u0026lsquo;to make money\u0026rsquo; hold the essence of human morality.\nYet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters\u0026rsquo; continents. Now the looters\u0026rsquo; credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide— as, I think, he will.\nUntil and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns—or dollars. Take your choice—there is no other—and your time is running out.\u0026quot; 2\n Rand, A. (1996). Atlas Shrugged.

C took us to the most famous sea food restaurant here. ABC seafood center ! We spent a good 20 minutes to find a place to park only to find over 20 people waiting in line. But luckily C had arranged for everything and we just had to go to the table where he and other team members were sitting. But I wondered.. why so many? what do they sell here? why so many people? The restaurant was a huge circular hall and it looked same from all sides. Seemed as though there were circular tables all over and the same group of people sitting around every table. I looked again .. and again. They looked so alike. It is difficult to tell one Chinese from another and the big crowd in front gave the impression of 100s of duplicates sitting next to each other and chattering. There .. a vision of unity, of co-operation, of singleness of purpose.\n Some days all he did in the college was to speak to SN. When it came to philosophy, about the purpose of life, the meaning of life and things around, there was none better than SN. It sometimes seemed to him as though SN had a complete grasp of the whole universe. There were so many things that SN seemed to know. Those days SN was learning Sanskrit in his spare time.None could fathom SN's knowledge from outside. SN came across as jolly-jovial-loved-by-all chap. SN was very clear in his speech. Very lucid. One would never miss a point when SN spoke. SN never hurried.  Once SN had come to his home. The moment they saw him, his mother and sisters had exclaimed. ‘Oh ! he looks so alike you’, they told him. SN’s parents too were surprised at the similarity. Those days a stranger might easily have taken them for brothers.  He later looked at himself in the mirror. He was never one to bother much about the way he looked. So he couldn’t tell if he had changed or not! But he found that he spoke slower that he used to. Words were not gushing out of his mouth anymore. They were coming out slowly, purposefully. They soothed him and those whom he spoke with.

That’s all? Aww’ he thought. He could now do it in a mere two hours. Instead of rejoicing that his labour had finally borne fruit, he was unhappy. A person with experience could do it in 2 hours. But could anyone have experience in every minute thing in the world? Experience means recognizing patterns. Attribute the observed pattern to something that you have already done. If you have competence in that field, you must have done something similar. You must have read about something on similar lines.\nSome time back RV had told me what he had learnt in some programme that he had attended - about different levels of competence. There are 4 levels of competence\n Unconscious Incompetence Conscious Incompetence Conscious Competence Unconscious Competence  You are in the first stage if you don’t know that you don’t know. The second stage is when you know that you don’t know. The third is when you know that you know. The fourth when you, after having transcended the knowing stage, aren’t even aware that you know. For instance, when you become very adept at driving, you can do it skillfully without even concentrating on it. Is it possible that you have qualities that put you in level 4 directly with regards to doing things ? That you are gifted from birth ? Nah ! you gotta work for it. Only experience can get you to level 4 when you can perform the magic of doing a task in 2 hours which a CC would take 3 days, CI couple of weeks and a UI cannot hope to do.\n He doesn’t remember why they were on the dark unlit road.

They run towards the bus stand and he manages to catch the last bus to Thiruvanmiyur in the nick of time. Things are so calm and quite in the bus. He looks around and realizes that he is the only passenger. He thinks over everything that R had said. R seemed like a prophet. He had felt so many times in school too. Sometime later he looks into his bag. It is heavy. R had given him a lot of books. ‘Take how many ever you want’, R had said. There were 2 boxes full of books. He had taken around 8 or 10.

Krishna, my closest pal during childhood; my first best friend (first best friend !! does that sound strange ? well ! at different times in life I had different best friends. Guys with whom I had nothing to hide and who hid nothing from me. My brothers.) All day I was wondering what to give. He generally was fond of things carved out of glass. The only doubt was whether he still liked showpieces . well, I thought I’d go to the shop and decide. Brigades was on the way. I decided to put at stop at Archies there to choose a gift. As always there was no place to park. Went downwards alng Church Street looking for a space. Drove, drove and drove .. finally found a place to park. Turned around to see something that I would always love to see. Blossoms. Something was going on. Was it being renovated ? No, this was the newly furnished ground floor and was still being filled with books. I went to the first floor – straight to the du Maurier section. Eyes sought ‘My cousin Rachel’ . There it was – a greenish book with a lady draped in a green shawl looking directly at me. Behind her was a house, a villa. The villa was a bit far off. Between the villa and her one could see a lot of greenery. Trees all around and a well maintained lawn.\nI turned the book and started with what was written on the back cover (I hate reading whatever is written in the back cover. I feel it somehow gives away the author, somehow cheats me, somehow doesn’t give me the right to let the events unwind in my mind since I start expecting things to happen. My best readings have come from books of which I hadn’t read an introduction, of which I knew nothing, expected nothing. I don’t know how many of you like to see movie trailers or would enjoy the movie after you have been told the story.) Anyway, the crime was committed. I read it in a single go ..\n“Ambrose married Rachel and never returned home. His letters to his cousin hinted that he was being poisoned and when Philip arrived in Italy, Ambrose was dead…”\nI’ll put a stop to Gorky and start with du Maurier.\n..\n6/20 It’s a flashback. Philip’s flashback. It’s about him recounting the events that haunt him. Philip ? Philip in ‘The Mill on the floss’ had a hunchback, Philip in ‘Of Human Bondage’ had a clubfoot, what disadvantage does this Philip have ? None? He is orphaned, yes, but none with his physique, something with the psyche though.\nWhen the narrative starts with Tom Jenkyn’s hanging that he had witnessed in his childhood, you wonder why he is telling about it and as you go further, you tend to dismiss it as some bad happening that he had witnessed as a kid.\nHaving lost his parents at a very young age he was brought up by Ambrose, his cousin. Ambrose was everything to Philip, He was Philip’s father, mother, guardian, teacher, role model – all in one. Ambrose is unmarried, is very passionate about garden, always trying to gather some rare shrub to plant.\nThe story starts with a middle aged Ambrose not being able to withstand winters in England. He is advised to go to a hotter place and this time Ambrose decides to go to Italy. From Italy he writes to Philip often. In one of his letters he mentions about meeting a distant cousin of theirs, cousin Rachel. In the next few letters he is all words about Rachel, describing her interest in gardening and trees. The letter after that comes with the news of him being married to Rachel. This is a shock to Philip and he feels as though someone has taken Ambrose away from him. But he conveys the news to his neighbours who are really happy upon hearing the news. The letters from Ambrose stop coming. After a long time, Philip gets a very short letter from Ambrose, in illegible handwriting , hinting that his wife is trying to kill him. Philip gets alarmed, speaks to his godfather Nick Kendal, who says Ambrose might not be well and that he might have tumour in the head that his father had.\nPhilip sets out to Italy.\n..\n6/21 On the way he gets a mail from Ambrose asking him to leave to Italy immediately. With great difficulty he get to Florence and when he reaches the Sangaletti villa, he is informed that Ambrose is dead. Philip is almost devastated and inconsolable. He could not even imagine that he would never see Ambrose again. He comes to know that Rachel has left the place taking away all of Ambrose\u0026rsquo;s possessions except for a hat. Philip takes the hat and sets out to meet Rachel\u0026rsquo;s friend Rainaldi. Rainaldi is a matter-of-fact businesslike person and Philip takes an immediate dislike for him.\nPhilip sets back to England. After a few months, he is called by his godfather Nick who tells him about a mail from Rachel. Rachel was planning to come to visit them.\nHeader Image - \u0026ldquo;Cornwall England\u0026rdquo; by barnyz via Flickr\n","description":"","id":93,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"My Cousin Rachel by Daphne du Maurier","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-17-my-cousin-rachel-daphne-du-maurier/"},{"content":"The story starts with Makar , an aged gypsy conversing with the author. It is dark , the wind is heavy , the campfire is blazing furiously ..yet Makar , smoking his huge pipe , was unfazed. It was as though these heavy conditions never affected him.(reminds me of Vikram-Betal stories of chandamama ! it was dark , the night was heavy , yet Vikram was unfazed. He climbed the tree , pulled the corpse out . as he started walking away with it , the corpse on his shoulder came to life !!!) .\nMakar is of the opinion that people are born to travel; that there is nothing better than traveling. “A curious lot people are ; they herd together trampling on each other when there is so much of space-” . he asks why a man should be ploughing a field . “A man who ploughs land pours his strength into the land. He not only loses his strength but also his freedom. He is tied to the soil. I have traveled so much , seen so much and learnt so much that you would require a 1000 bags of paper to put them all in.”\nWait , wait ! what’s happening ? is this the story of an old gypsy and his philosophy ? dear pal , it certainly is not. who , in reality is he in the story ? No one. He is less significant that the phone operator in my office who connects me to some important person outside whom I wish to speak to . The story belongs to the fearless youth Loiko Zobar or does it belong to the beautiful but vicious Radda ? Let us pace towards them.\nThe talk stops when they hear Nonka , Makar’s daughter singing. The author looks at her and is fascinated by her beauty. Makar says “you would like to have a beautiful maid like her to fall in love with you . wouldn’t you ? No good for you. Put no faith in women. Once you kiss one , all your freedom is gone. You will come to ruins. Let me tell you a story -”\nLoiko Zobar was a fearless youth who was famous across the whole of steppes. If he ever took fancy to something , it was his . He traveled hither and tither as he pleased. There were at least 10 men in each village who had sworn to take his head. But they couldn’t even touch a hair on his head. It was said that he could even knife the devil if he came in his way.\n“His moustaches swept down his shoulders , where they mingled with his hair; his eyes shone like two bright stars, and his smile was sun itself. ..When he looked into your eyes, your soul surrendered to him, and instead of being ashamed of this, you were proud of it. You seemed to always become better in his presence.”\n(Though I see Richard Grenvile in every brave man whom I read of , if I were to write about Richard , the description would match the one above – word to word.)\nRadda was the queen among beauties. A man could not but be rooted to the place where he stood if he saw her. “No words could ever describe Radda’s beauty. Perhaps it could be played on a violin , but only by one who knew the instrument as he knew his soul.”\nMany many men asked for her hand but she refused. A rich man was so dumbstruck with her beauty that he was ready to give away everything for her sake. But she was too haughty. To the rich man her reply was “if the eagle’s mate went into the nest of a crow of her own will, what would you think of her ? ”. Likewise she mocked at everyone who asked her hand.\nIn one of his travels , Zobar chanced to come to the camp that Radda was in.\n….\nAt once smitten by Radda’s beauty he tries to woo her. But she finds his talk humourless, finds his music bland, she doesn’t in anyway relent to him. Zobar plunges into deep despair and is seen playing his fiddle throughout the night. He is so brilliant with the fiddle, that his music melts everyone’s heart.\n“You felt that tune with every fibre of your body, and you became a slave of it. And if at that moment Zobar had called out ‘out with your knives, comrades’, every man would have bared his knife against anyone he pointed out. He could wind a person with his little finger, but everyone loved him dearly”. Such was Zobar’s effect on all. Yet Radda would have nothing at all of it. She mocked him continuously. While all others appreciated every song that he sang, she vehemently criticised them.\nNot finding a way to make her approve of him directly, Zobar approaches Danilo, Radda’s father. Danilo approves; says “Take her if you can” . Radda is seen sitting on a horse and Zobar approaches her. He says he has seen many a woman but none as fiery and beautiful as her. He asks her to be his wife but warns her that being his wife doesn’t mean that she would be able to curb his freedom. In reply she lashes her whip at him. The whip catches his feet and pulls him down. He falls on the ground on the back of his head. Radda has a wild grin on her face.\nAs he limps away Radda dismounts from the horse and comes towards him. As soon as she is near him, Zobar goes for his knife, Radda pulls her pistol out. She tells him that she is ready for truce, that she finds him the bravest man in the whole of steppe, the only one who could ever stand up to her. She presents a proposition before him . If she has to be his wife he has to touch her feet in front of every one around and then kiss her hand. She tells him that her passionate kisses and caresses are just waiting for him. Under their effect he will forget the brave life he led in the past and be a servant of her for ever.\nEveryone finds it distasteful that Zobar has to touch her feet. Zobar says nothing, he goes away. He is seen thinking the whole night, sometimes playing sad tones with his fiddle in the night .\nThe next day comes . Zobar tells his comrades that he will touch her feet but he needed to test how strong her heart was. Zobar walks towards Radda , goes close to her and plunges his knife into her heart. She pulls the knife out and moments before life went out of her she said “Farewell Zobar. I knew you would do it”. As the stunned crowd sees a lifeless Radda fall down, Zobar throws himself on her feet. Moments later everyone is still silent as Zobar gets up and starts to walk away. It was then that Danilo Rushes towards Zobar and thrusts his knife to the back of his heart. Zobar falls.\nThe image of Radda and Zobar lying dead keeps circling in the author\u0026rsquo;s mind, but Makar continues smoking his huge cigar.\nHeader Image - \u0026ldquo;The steppe\u0026rdquo; by Alan Fieldus via Flickr\n","description":"","id":94,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"Makar Chudra by Maxim Gorky","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-15-makar-chudra-maxim-gorky/"},{"content":"The “The Kings General” is unlike any novel that I’ve read. It’s as pacy as a modern day thriller. Reminds me of “Gone with the wind” though. It is about Richard Grenvile, the king’s General in the west, the bravest amongst the brave, the lion of the times, the king’s darling, the rebels’ dread and about the only woman in the world he cared for : Honor Harris – a beautiful lady who was crippled just a day before their marriage in a tragic accident.\nThe novel is a first person narrative by Honor and from the time it starts with her brother Kit’s marriage to Gartred Grenvile, events unfurl one after another so quickly that within no time you would find yourself in Menabilly amidst a raging civil war between the forces of the King and the Parliament, pausing probably in the middle during the accident which cripples Honor, more due to shock than because the story slackens in pace there.\nHeader Image - \u0026ldquo;The Cornish coast at Menabilly\u0026rdquo; by Matt Buck via Flickr\n","description":"","id":95,"section":"books","tags":null,"title":"The King's General by Daphne du Maurier","uri":"https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-11-kings-general-dumaurier/"},{"content":"Much as I want to buy as many books as I want , I don’t like being forced into book-buying , to feel that I’ve done something which I could’ve avoided. That’s exactly what happens when I go to Church street / MG Road. Blossoms, Gangarams, HigginBothams, LB publishers, Crossword ; so many book shops each just a hop away from each other that almost all the time , I’d just enter one , lose my whole evening , and most of time feel : “this is the time to buy , what if I am short of cash tomorrow ? What if I get so busy that I cannot come here? Moreover I’m getting a discount here” … mind always finds some reason. Only after I leave the book shop would the impact hit me ; that my pockets just got shallower.\nThe latest book-buying was just a couple of weeks back. Had gone there to meet a friend. Saw Blossoms. Thought , \u0026lsquo;I anyway have another 30 mins to go. lemme check out the books. just see not buy.\u0026rsquo; Went in and immediately remembered my friend telling me about “The King\u0026rsquo;s General” by Daphne du Maurier. OK . Bought that and 3 more - Barclays study guide to St.Mark’s Gospel , S K George’s Story of Bible and an omnibus containing all Sherlock holmes stories. Regrets ? No .

I\u0026rsquo;m Rob.\nI also go by Robin or sometimes Robinson.\nWelcome to my personal website and blog.\nWho am I? Though born and brought up in Bangalore as a Keralite practicing Orthodox faith, I\u0026rsquo;ve been influenced by multiple people and ideas. I love to ask big questions about life and the universe and try to find my own answers or relate to books and movies. I constantly have the feeling that there is much to learn, and I\u0026rsquo;ve only scratched the surface. I am an optimist. I believe in serendipity as surprisingly blissful things have happened in my life when I least expected them.\nI think life throws similar scenarios at us so that we get a chance to do better next time. Everything - days, months, years, birthdays, anniversaries, festivals - happen in cycles, and we get to relive similar moments as wiser people with time. People that we\u0026rsquo;re meant to deal with - friends or foes, keep coming in and out of our orbit even when we don\u0026rsquo;t expect because we still have things to share and learn together.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful for having been surrounded by people and places that brought out the best in me. If you knew me many years back and find me changed with better abilities and more knowledge than before, thank the people I\u0026rsquo;ve had the chance to be with. I also feel fortunate for being alive at this point in time in the history of mankind. It is arguably the best era so far.\nWhat do I do? I\u0026rsquo;m a Software Progressional working in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been fortunate to get multiple opportunities to work on mission-critical systems in the past couple of decades which I\u0026rsquo;ve spent building systems at scale - systems that processed billions of records, web pages that got over 100 million hits per day, APIs that had over a couple of billion calls per day, systems that handled monetary transactions of millions of users and so forth. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked both as a backend engineer and engineering manager, though the past decade has been mostly as an engineering manager.\nI\u0026rsquo;m drawn towards projects that are challenging and have tough timelines. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on projects that were new ideas and huge re-architecture projects. I love the responsibility that comes with the ownership of a system that is 24/7 and the quick-thinking that is needed to resolve ad-hoc issues that impact customers. I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed working in small, close-knit teams that focused on achieving a large singular goal than doing multiple inconsequential things in parallel.\nMy career has mostly been on e-commerce and payment systems. Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve started focusing more on cloud and cybersecurity platforms. I love to learn new things and read books on a variety of topics. I also love to teach and believe that to be my natural talent, with everything else being acquired over the course of my life. I always welcome any opportunity to teach on the side if time permits and hope to do more of it at a later stage.\nHobbies Other than software development, I love traveling - mainly to historic landmarks, reading (poetry, classics, sci-fi, technical and semi-technical books). I also love walking long distances and hiking. I\u0026rsquo;ve run a few half marathons and am looking forward to running a full sometime in the future.\nWriting This website is a collection of my writings on several topics, ranging from books read, places traveled, technologies learnt, and some notes on software. I\u0026rsquo;ve thought whether I should focus on just one topic - say notes on books read, or on places traveled. Or whether the site should be a professional portfolio. But I\u0026rsquo;ve decided against those and write the thoughts as-is like I\u0026rsquo;m talking to a friend. So, all the opinions are like casual conversations.\nAlso, I write everything with the view that it is a draft that I could come back and modify later. I do go back and edit posts when I can.\nI was fortunate to publish a couple of papers and book chapters while doing MSCS at SJSU. I wish I could dedicate time and do more of it.\n Raju, R., Moh, M., \u0026amp; Moh, T. S. (2018, July).

Website The current site is a static site generated using Hugo. The site has taken different shapes over the years. The content has been in Blogger, Wordpress, Google Sites, etc. So the site is also an avenue to try some new technology for me.\nIterations  Blogger (2005) Google Sites (~2008) Wordpress (2013) Jekyll with Github pages (2017) - Clean blog theme. Hugo with Github pages (2020) - Anatole , Aurora, Paperesque, Even, Diary (Current) themes.  Why not Blogger, Wordpress, etc. ?  A static site is faster. I don\u0026rsquo;t intend to run ads or do any kind of tracking. Many of the platforms may have a fine print that says they own the content. Easier to migrate to new themes or platforms. I don\u0026rsquo;t need the bells and whistles of a CMS platform yet.
