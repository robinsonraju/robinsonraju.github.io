    <p>In this post, we take a segway from discussions around Agile methodology and focus on something that is very important for everyone’s career – to have an online professional profile, something that someone can look at and find out about your career, capabilities and achievements.</p>
<p>There are many sites where one can host a professional profile but LinkedIn is the most popular business oriented social networking service. With a huge database of over 120 million people, all of whom you can search and most of whom you can message within minutes, LinkedIn is far ahead in features and reach than other networking services. Employers and recruiters actively look at LinkedIn profiles either to find potential candidates that suit the role that they are looking for or to find out more about the person that they are interviewing. So it is very pertinent to look a little in-depth at what the site provides and how effectively it could be used.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-linkedin-provide">What does LinkedIn provide?</h2>
<p>LinkedIn’s remarkable value is making our second and third degree networks visible, as well as the connecting paths, thereby revealing the networks of people we know. Thus it helps in finding the right people using our connections. Here is a short summary of what LinkedIn provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides an ability to find and identify the right people through 2nd and 3rd degree networks and connecting paths.</li>
<li>Gives a platform to discover information that can help in a conversation, meeting or network event by reading the other person’s LinkedIn Profile beforehand.</li>
<li>Helps in maintaining relationships with your network via personal messages, sharing ideas in Discussions and helping people out in Answers.</li>
<li>Helps in getting Recommendations which are visible to anyone, but in particular to the people who are important in your job or for your goals.</li>
<li>Provides a platform to receive introductions and referrals to the people who matter to you via the introduction tool or a regular email.</li>
<li>Helps in discovering the relationships between people by looking at mutual connections.</li>
<li>Raises your visibility, reputation, personal brand, and company brand via your LinkedIn Profile, your contributions in Answers and Discussions and on the web via search engines.</li>
<li>Helps in “word of mouth publicity” by receiving Recommendations, or from people recommending you in Discussions or mentioning you as the expert in Answers.</li>
<li>The platform sends notifications via Network Updates when someone changes jobs. This might be a good reminder to reconnect with them.</li>
<li>Helps in picking up trends in the marketplace via Discussions.</li>
<li>Assists in finding professional organizations to join, both online and offline, via Groups, and via people’s Profiles.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linkedin-profile">LinkedIn profile:</h2>
<p>Your LinkedIn profile is the page that people go to when they want to find out information about you. It means that many times, it is the first professional impression you make on someone. You need to make your profile relevant and highlight specific portions so that it increases your visibility, supports your personal branding and reputation.A good Profile increases your visibility on LinkedIn and also on the web. Google and other search engines index the information from your Public Profile on LinkedIn. Since LinkedIn has a high Page Ranking in Google the Profiles will also appear high in search results. If someone is not looking for you, but looking for a person with skills that you are expert at; a great LinkedIn profile will channel them to you.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-market-yourself-by-creating-a-great-linkedin-profile">How to market yourself by creating a great LinkedIn profile</h2>
<p>There are 5 portions of your profile that you need to focus on to create an attractive LinkedIn profile:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your “Teaser”: Picture, Name, Professional Headline, Location and Industry.</li>
<li>Short Overview: Current &amp; Past experience, Education, Recommendations, Connections, Websites, Twitter, and Public Profile.</li>
<li>The Core: Summary and Specialties.</li>
<li>The Specifics: Experience, Education, and Sections.</li>
<li>The Details: Additional Information, Personal Information, and Contact Settings.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. Teaser</strong>: Make sure that you provide a professional picture. Since there is not much space for photo, just focus on have a good photo of your face with the upper torso. Make sure that you provide a name that people can recognize you with. Do not give nicknames. Give a professional headline that tells something about your area of expertise. By default it is the current job title, but it is better to change it. Provide a location that indicates where you are working out of. Also provide the industry where you have your expertise.</p>
<p><strong>2. Short Overview</strong>: It is important to use “Current &amp; Past Experience” section to help being found by former colleagues or by people searching for skills and roles that you have performed. Education is an important section where you could get found by people searching for alumni from specific schools or to connect with your former class or school mates. Recommendation is another powerful feature that you could use. Make it a habit to ask for recommendations, and provide recommendations for other people. Make it a point to have connections who know you or can recommend your skills. If you cannot have one of your connections give you introduction to another, it is not of much use. There is also a section that asks you about your websites and you can list up to 3 websites. Instead of the standard “Company website” or “Personal website”, choose “Other”and then write some compelling text. If you have a Twitter account, list it so that people can follow you. At this moment this feature exists on LinkedIn also. But if you are actively posting on Twitter, it makes sense to post Twitter link. Lastly, you must take care to see that you have a public profile URL that is not the standard undecipherable alpha-numeric string but a URL with your name it in. This is good for SEO.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Core</strong>: “Summary” is the place where you convey a lot of information about you in a very small area. It should not be too long or too short. The recommendation from Jon Vermeiren’s book “How to really use LinkedIn” is to use three blocks of text: information about the organization, some professional information about yourself, and some personal information. “Specialties” is the place to share the skills and knowledge you have accumulated in all your past jobs. This is the place to explain your expertise. You can put your certifications, knowledge of tools and programming languages, jargons, acronyms that are relevant to your industry here.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Specifics</strong>: The “Summary and Specialties” section has limited room. The Specifics section is where you describe in as much detail, your experience and education – including courses, projects, certifications, patents, organizations, etc.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Details</strong>: In this section you provide additional information related to your interests, groups that you belong to, honors and awards, personal information to reach you, etc.</p>
<p>The above steps need to be followed through on a periodic basis to ensure that the information does not get stale. Keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date is the best strategy to market yourself and present your best to the world.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-expand-your-network">How to expand your network:</h2>
<p>In their book <strong>“How to really use LinkedIn”</strong>, Vermeiren &amp; Verdonck give 4 phases to building a foundation of your LinkedIn network.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Upload your email contacts and connect with the ones already on LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Phase 2: Find current and former colleagues and classmates and connect with them.</li>
<li>Phase 3: Discover people you may know and connect with the ones you actually know.</li>
<li>Phase 4: Promote your LinkedIn Profile with a LinkedIn Email Signature and LinkedIn Profile Badge for your website and blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have done these, you have a solid foundation on which you can build your network. It is said that there are just 6 degrees of separation between everyone in the world and since LinkedIn gives you 3 degrees of connections, you can leverage it to reach any contact that you have in mind. The next logical step is to join Groups that are relevant to your area or work or expertise. Groups are a place to help others and be helped by them, to apply the Golden Triangle of Networking and to raise your Know, Like, and Trust factor. Once you participate in some groups and gain trust and establish your brand as someone who can answer questions on specific topics, you can start groups or become Group manager.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other strategies to network and improve your sphere of influence. As you use LinkedIn more, you would be able to effectively find more of your ‘target audience’ by doing specific searches, setting up alerts, browsing the connections of people in your network, browsing through LinkedIn recommendations of who to connect to, which groups to join, etc.</p>
