        <description>“Into this wild abyss,
The womb of nature and perhaps her grave,
Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,
Unless the almighty maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more worlds,</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Teams that are best at DevOps and continuous delivery can release software thousands of times more quickly and with a small fraction of the defects.&amp;rdquo;
 The above quote is from Dave Farley&amp;rsquo;s review1 of &amp;ldquo;The State of DevOps&amp;rdquo; report2. It rang so true that I tweeted it. Martin Fowler responded to the original Tweet from Dave asking if there was a transcript available.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;God needs no faint hearts for his ambassadors.&amp;rdquo;
~ Margaret Thatcher in The Crown Season 4, Episode 2 1
 The Poem In the second episode of Netflix&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The Crown&amp;rsquo; 2, Margaret Thatcher recites a poem to the Queen, named &amp;lsquo;No Enemies&amp;rsquo; by Charles Mackay. This was in response to the Queen saying that Thatcher is making a lot of enemies.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s foolish to run the risk of going mad for vanity&amp;rsquo;s sake.&amp;quot;
~ French Philosopher Diderot (From Netflix&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Queen&amp;rsquo;s Gambit&amp;rdquo; 1)
 The Dream For the first time in so many years, I had a dream about Chess. Like many dreams, it is in the mind and is kind of difficult to exactly describe it.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to settle for something that you don&amp;rsquo;t like. Because, if you never admit you&amp;rsquo;re unhappy with something, then you never have to change anything.
Most of us don&amp;rsquo;t speak up when we&amp;rsquo;re dissatisfied and then things just accumulate until you can&amp;rsquo;t really imagine an alternative.&amp;rdquo;
~ John Wilson in Scaffolding (Episode 2 of &amp;lsquo;How to with John Wilson&amp;rsquo;1)</description>

        <description>Reflecting on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&amp;rsquo;s passing away.
RBG - Steadfast Commitment  “The arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice,” but only “if there is a steadfast commitment to see the task through to completion.”
~ Ruth Bader Ginsburg
 RBG was a revolutionary, someone who made a dent in the world while she was living, someone who is affecting the lives of so many after her passing away.</description>

~ Jean-Jacques Rousseau 1
 The movie - C U Soon Saw this amazing movie named C U Soon2 on Amazon Prime. The movie format was unique. Most of it was shown through video conferencing and chat. One gets to know the characters and their lives through chat messages and dialogues that happen through video apps.</description>

        <description>Happened to watch the first 3 episodes of Raised by Wolves1. I was expecting just an episode to get launched in the typical HBO fashion. But getting 3 episodes was a bonus. Though I would have preferred to just have one. It would have given enough time to think about the episode and read articles about it till the next one came.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Money is the root of all evil&amp;rdquo; took a different meaning in my mind when I read this portion (quote below) from Thinking, Fast and Slow. Set me thinking about different interactions with people in the past and different kinds of projects and people&amp;rsquo;s attitudes.
What came to mind were transformations in people when the goal was changed from &amp;lsquo;doing something to benefit someone&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;doing something to meet a financial target&amp;rsquo;.</description>

        <description>A couple of folks asked me recently my opinion on how to do well in an Engineering Manager interview or what should they do to be more successful. I provided some inputs based on my experience of interviewing and hiring eng managers.
Also thought I&amp;rsquo;d write down notes as a way to help others who might find it useful.</description>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of migrating the site to a new theme which had a better font than I had. Also wanted a smaller font to cover lot of text in a smaller area. Stumbled upon paperesque theme on hugo themes site. It was a simple theme with lot more focus on writing.</description>

        <description>One of the things that I wanted to do this year was to focus a bit more on writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve had times when I wrote in bursts, and I always told myself - Yeah, this is great. I should do more of it. It is not like I feel like a Yoda who knows too much and needs to write down to teach others, in fact, it is just the opposite.</description>

        <description>The following two quotes sum up my ideal of leadership.
&amp;ldquo;The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.&amp;rdquo; ~ Ronald Reagan
&amp;ldquo;A leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.</description>

        <description>Was listening to the awesome title sequence of His Dark Materials again today. It is one of those pieces of music that keep replaying in your mind even after you stop listening to it. I love listening to Intro sequence themes and there are some iconic ones among American TV shows.</description>

        <description>As a person who loves checking off items in &amp;lsquo;to-do&amp;rsquo; lists and checklists, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked books that have a list of rules/principles. Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.</description>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;d mentioned in another post that I&amp;rsquo;d do some research on Kerala-Russia connection and get back. This post is in response to that. First some context on what we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.
Background Wife read the post on Oru Sangeerthanam Pole and really got fascinated by Perumbadavam and Dostoyevsky. She got busy reading articles on Dostoyevsky and Perumbadavam and also a couple of Perumbadavam&amp;rsquo;s interviews on Youtube.</description>

        <description>While I was walking down the memory lane yesterday, I remembered meeting RR in Chennai and his gift of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. We were best friends in school and I had lost touch with him during engineering. One day there was an email and he said he was in Chennai.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.&amp;quot;
~ Emerson
 Had a dream about me being in Chennai and being asked about a book that I was reading. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember who it was, but it was someone happy to see me with a book.</description>

        <description>Thankfully most of the demonstrations across the U.S. today were peaceful. There was one in San Ramon also where people marched from our local Safeway (Gale Ranch) to City Hall near Bishop Ranch.
But the wound is deep. The anguish and heartbreak will not go away. Anyone who has seen the videos cannot remain not being horrified and scared.</description>

        <description>The optimism around cybersecurity was dampened today by a news article on WSJ - &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Startups Feel a Pinch on Funding and Sales&amp;rdquo;.
 Cybersecurity startups are finding they have to do more with less, as the economic drag of coronavirus precautions makes it difficult to sell their products and enlist new customers while it simultaneously diminishes the size of their funding rounds, investors say.</description>

        <description>For the past few years, I have read quite a few materials on cybersecurity. In 2017, my professor at SJSU asked me to write a paper on IoT Security and Machine Learning techniques used to protect IoT systems. That was really interesting. Learnt about IoT, Fog Computing, Privacy and Security issues with IoT systems during that time.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction. Today, it is headed in another.&amp;rdquo;
Was super glad to see Cloud Atlas as one of the books in Bill Gates&amp;rsquo;s reading list for this summer. I bought the book back in 2013 but haven&amp;rsquo;t read it yet.
I still remember the first time I saw a trailer for the movie Cloud Atlas and being amazed and speechless.</description>

        <description>A couple of years back, I chanced upon an article where someone was describing how simple it was to set up a static website using Ghost. That made me think if I should explore moving from Jekyll to something newer. New frameworks keep coming up and it probably is a good idea to shift to keep up.</description>

List of books that I have read, started to read, heard a lot about and want to read. I can at least talk one sentence about these books.
Have written a draft of my Reading Journey which is a short recollection of what I read when.</description>

Try to be an optimist and seek out the good in your life. Find ways to build on your successes. Stop regretting your failures and start learning from your mistakes.</description>

        <description>Reading &amp;ldquo;The Proof of Heaven&amp;rdquo; by Dr. Eben Alexander is almost like experiencing the NDE that he went through, to really be at the hospital with him where his loved ones were holding his hand 24/7 while he was in a coma, to be with him while he went through the underground, the gateway and the core back and forth experiencing the bright light and the melodious songs and the angelic being, to be able to hear with the whole being without anyone talking, to be able to see without physical eyes, to not have a concept of time, to feel a divine presence and be overjoyed to the fullest.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan &amp;lsquo;Press On&amp;rsquo; has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Ankle deep, he waded through the bluebells. His spirit rose and exalted&amp;hellip; as he breathed in the sun-drenched air. The glorious day was in its last decline. Long shadows lay on the sward&amp;hellip; and from above the leaves dripped their shimmering drops of gold-green light.
Moths and butterflies swarmed in merry hosts&amp;hellip; flittering here, glimmering there.</description>

        <description>More than a year whizzed past without me writing anything here.
When you&amp;rsquo;re working for a company that does more than double the work in less than half the time that the client does it in and if the client happens to be this uber-fast techie company that rolls out 8 million lines of code once every 2 weeks with almost 50K lines of code changing every week, time is a pricey quantity.</description>

        <description>A has given me the ultimatum.
&amp;ldquo;It is too much. You&amp;rsquo;ve been fooling me for more than a year. Write now. Just 10 minutes. Whatever comes to your mind&amp;rdquo;
She&amp;rsquo;s been hitting the url for over a year expecting me to surprise her by writing something and I&amp;rsquo;ve always been saying.</description>

        <description>I’m lying flat on my back and looking at the open sky. It is clear. There are no stars. Only a single moon.
Is the queen of the night sky smiling at me ?
Or at the seabird sitting at the stern.
Or at her own beauty that is reflected by the sea ?</description>

        <description>Thought of finally taking a break to roll up my sleeves, blow the dust off the writing desk and sit and gather the fluttering paper rainbow butterflies and stick them to the book.  They’re around, just a catch away. The touch of the rainbow butterflies, oh boy ! they almost take my breath away.</description>

        <description>Re-lived a wonderful moment when I accidentally read one of my old scribblings.
 There are some places where the moment you go, you feel completely at ease ; you’d stay, transfixed with a longing in your heart to be left there forever! It could be a library, a church, a temple, top of a mountain, a beach, an island, a hut in the middle of a forest, a river bank .</description>

        <description>In my dream I was sleeping. A was shaking my hand.
“Achaya..wake up.. wake up.. I can’t find the books.”
“What books ? ”
“The ones I kept in the box yesterday. The box is empty now.”
“Yeah, the books walked away. You ignored them for too long. You know indifference is a punishment more severe than hatred.</description>

        <description>A recent trip to Mount Shasta became more memorable due to me losing my glasses. When the optician asked me if I wanted the sunlight coating, I said yes. Well ! when someone sounds as though she’s offering the best thing in the world, you’ve got no option but to have it.</description>

        <description>S called. Before he started speaking, I knew what he’d say. Let’s meet up and study something. Yeah ! it’s been over a month since 2nd semester started and we hadn’t even looked into the books list. EC1 was a couple of weeks ahead. It was time.
He was in Stanford meeting up with some friend.</description>

        <description>He was standing near the sun. There was brightness everywhere, almost blinding him. He could see the rays going away – far away to distant lands, giving light, feeding happiness.
But he couldn’t stand there for long. Some strong force was pulling him away. He clenched his teeth, tightened his muscles, held his fists in a tight grip, He tried .</description>

        <description>Some days you get up slowly ..
sit or sometimes sit n sleep on the bed for sometime ..
wait for thoughts to gather, slowly come into terms with the world – as though you need time to gradually transition from one world to completely different one – as though you just came out of water and you’re gasping for breath.</description>

Yes ! he is the one .. the mathematician who solved the most famous unsolvable problem in the history of Mathematics . Over a span of 3 centuries, thousands of brilliant and hardworking men and women were at it.</description>

        <description>Though sleeping, reading and watching movies were the only major things that I did during this weekend, what I really wanted to do was to go to a beach, write something, put it into a bottle and throw it into the sea.
Yeah ! Yes ! just like that !</description>

        <description>St.George’s festival. Theophilus thirumeni (formerly MC Cherian achen) went over St. George’s life – the same story that had been told to me many times as a kid – more so because I had this paranoid fear of snakes. I’ve had moments in which I missed stamping on a snake or a snake bite by sheer luck !</description>

        <description>&#34;...bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens Brown paper packages tied up with strings,
These are a few of my favorite things.&#34;
 ~ &#39;The Sound of Music&#39; The first thing that I did was to watch the rest of &amp;lsquo;The Sound of Music&#39;
The &amp;lsquo;favourite things&amp;rsquo; song was still afresh in my mind.</description>

        <description>Fransisco d&amp;rsquo;Anconia&amp;rsquo;s speech from Atlas Shrugged1 when someone says &amp;ldquo;Money is the root of all evil&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;So you think that money is the root of all evil?&amp;quot; said Francisco d&amp;rsquo;Anconia.
&amp;ldquo;Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can&amp;rsquo;t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them.</description>

        <description>I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge.
That myth is more potent than history.
That dreams are more powerful than facts.
That hope always triumphs over experience.
That laughter is the only cure for grief.
And I believe that love is stronger than death.
This is from a book named ‘All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten’.</description>

        <description>Chinese new year ! C took us to the most famous sea food restaurant here. ABC seafood center ! We spent a good 20 minutes to find a place to park only to find over 20 people waiting in line. But luckily C had arranged for everything and we just had to go to the table where he and other team members were sitting.</description>

        <description>For three days he has been working on it.
Finally he got it. ‘Is that it? That’s all? Aww’ he thought. He could now do it in a mere two hours. Instead of rejoicing that his labour had finally borne fruit, he was unhappy. A person with experience could do it in 2 hours.</description>

        <description>The good soul decides to do something good. He feels happy about the great deed he is about to perform.
In his mind he sees obscure faces of people whom he might save.
When he had done it in the past, he had felt weak and had gone home and slept .</description>

        <description>Ever started your day in the office with a rude shock? I mean, shock in the literal sense. I’ve discovered that being a good chap who switches off his monitor before calling it a day (to save power!) has its disadvantages, especially if he is a ..err..&amp;lsquo;static electric&amp;rsquo; person – someone who gets a shock even before he touches the metal switch to turn on the power.</description>

        <description>Much as I want to buy as many books as I want , I don’t like being forced into book-buying , to feel that I’ve done something which I could’ve avoided. That’s exactly what happens when I go to Church street / MG Road. Blossoms, Gangarams, HigginBothams, LB publishers, Crossword ; so many book shops each just a hop away from each other that almost all the time , I’d just enter one , lose my whole evening , and most of time feel : “this is the time to buy , what if I am short of cash tomorrow ?</description>
