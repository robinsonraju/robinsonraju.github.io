      <description>As a person who loves checking off items in &amp;lsquo;to-do&amp;rsquo; lists and checklists, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked books that have a list of rules/principles. Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.</description>

      <description>The optimism around cybersecurity was dampened today by a news article on WSJ - &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Startups Feel a Pinch on Funding and Sales&amp;rdquo;.
 Cybersecurity startups are finding they have to do more with less, as the economic drag of coronavirus precautions makes it difficult to sell their products and enlist new customers while it simultaneously diminishes the size of their funding rounds, investors say.</description>

      <description>Reading &amp;ldquo;The Proof of Heaven&amp;rdquo; by Dr. Eben Alexander is almost like experiencing the NDE that he went through, to really be at the hospital with him where his loved ones were holding his hand 24/7 while he was in a coma, to be with him while he went through the underground, the gateway and the core back and forth experiencing the bright light and the melodious songs and the angelic being, to be able to hear with the whole being without anyone talking, to be able to see without physical eyes, to not have a concept of time, to feel a divine presence and be overjoyed to the fullest.</description>

      <description>More than a year whizzed past without me writing anything here. When you&amp;rsquo;re working for a company that does more than double the work in less than half the time that the client does it in and if the client happens to be this uber-fast techie company that rolls out 8 million lines of code once every 2 weeks with almost 50K lines of code changing every week, time is a pricey quantity.</description>

      <description>Some days you get up slowly ..
sit or sometimes sit n sleep on the bed for sometime ..
wait for thoughts to gather, slowly come into terms with the world – as though you need time to gradually transition from one world to completely different one – as though you just came out of water and you’re gasping for breath.</description>
