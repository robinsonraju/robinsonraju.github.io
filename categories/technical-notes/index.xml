        <description>&amp;ldquo;Like matter and antimatter, in the presence of unplanned work, all planned work ignites with incandescent fury, incinerating everything around it.&amp;rdquo;
~ Gene Kim, The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win1
 The book makes the case for proper planning, rigor, and discipline as an antidote to getting out of the impossible quagmire of technical debt, tightly coupled systems and unachievable product deadlines.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Teams that are best at DevOps and continuous delivery can release software thousands of times more quickly and with a small fraction of the defects.&amp;rdquo;
 The above quote is from Dave Farley&amp;rsquo;s review1 of &amp;ldquo;The State of DevOps&amp;rdquo; report2. It rang so true that I tweeted it. Martin Fowler responded to the original Tweet from Dave asking if there was a transcript available.</description>

        <description>As a person who loves checking off items in &amp;rsquo;to-do&amp;rsquo; lists and checklists, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked books that have a list of rules/principles. Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.</description>

        <description>Thoughts If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a sweeping introduction to all the various products under the Google Cloud umbrella, this is definitely the one you need to go through. The spectrum of offerings and the span that they cover amazed me. I had the knowledge of a few things - like GCE, App Engine, etc.</description>

        <description>Background While writing a note about My Reading Journey, I was reminded that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t put a section on list of books related to Computer Science in My Reading List. Was reminded of that again when I read today&amp;rsquo;s WSJ. The paper had a section towards the end dedicated to Cybersecurity.</description>

        <description>Came across a list of Threat Models in a book on Zero Trust Networks that I just started reading. I had heard of two models in the past - STRIDE and DREAD in the context of security thread classification and ranking for Cyber-physical systems Seifert &amp;amp; Reza (2016).
Before going into the popular models, what is Threat Modeling?</description>

        <description>This is an excellent course. It is a great refresher of a lot of cybersecurity concepts that most engineers might have heard of but not know. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know much, it would be much more useful since you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better knowledge of the attack vectors and all vulnerabilities that surround us daily.</description>

        <title>API documentation using Swagger</title>

        <description>Intro Wanted to create an API spec for brainstorming an API that we&amp;rsquo;re developing. Swagger is probably the most popular API design tool. I had used Apiary (https://apiary.io/) in the past (2013-14). It had features like defining the API spec using yaml and it getting rendered beautifully as API documentation. Nothing like a great API documentation that shows different methods, parameters, objects, input/output status codes and even a server/sandbox to try it out.</description>

        <description>The optimism around cybersecurity was dampened today by a news article on WSJ - &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Startups Feel a Pinch on Funding and Sales&amp;rdquo;.
 Cybersecurity startups are finding they have to do more with less, as the economic drag of coronavirus precautions makes it difficult to sell their products and enlist new customers while it simultaneously diminishes the size of their funding rounds, investors say.</description>

        <description>Starting to read up on blockchain. RV mentioned that I might need to learn Go if I need to tryout some HyperLedger frameworks in the future. Go has a cool playground to try things online and a tour which teaches you basics.
Rather than looking at them, I wanted to look at some actual code and infer how things work.</description>

        <description>Instead of remembering to build and push to GitHub, wanted to automate it. The steps are simple enough to write a script and have a cron job execute it.
The steps from the post on Setting up hugo site and publishing to github are below
cd &amp;lt;site directory&amp;gt; hugo cd &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;.</description>

        <description>A couple of years back, I chanced upon an article where someone was describing how simple it was to set up a static website using Ghost. That made me think if I should explore moving from Jekyll to something newer. New frameworks keep coming up and it probably is a good idea to shift to keep up.</description>

        <description>For someone who has been doing Java programming and reading through lot of OO codebase for over a decade, functional programming is truly a paradigm shift. It is not like learning a different language or different version of Java from Java 2 (1.2) to Java 8. The first time I was exposed to functional programming is probably around 2012 when I had to do a project for an ML course using R language.</description>

        <description>This blog is an attempt to walk through the process of using hadoop to analyze a dataset that might look similar to an actual dataset that we might encounter.
The objective is to read data from Iris dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris and calculate the mean sepal length of each class of the flower.</description>

        <description>The last blog was about how to run wordcount using the &amp;ldquo;hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar&amp;rdquo; that was automatically available in the VMs. How would it be to really write the Mapper and Reducer for this? I searched a bit for an eclipse plugin to be able to create a MR project through eclipse that would have the template for Mapper and Reducer and I would just write the implementation.</description>

        <description>Here is a small example to run Wordcount program on hadoop. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do this using Cloudera VM and also MapR Sandbox. When you start ClouderaVM, it is already loaded with desktop and you can do all the work inside the desktop - open a browser, start a terminal..etc. MapR Sandbox doesnt come with GUI, so you&amp;rsquo;d have to ssh into the machine to work on it.</description>

 Zhanjie, W., &amp;amp; Lang, S. (2013). Research on Distributional Stability of Chunk Sizes in Data Chunking. International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications, 443-450.
 Couple of weeks back we&amp;rsquo;d reviewed TTTD algorithm and an improvement of TTTD. While TTTD can chunk data according to data content and is more efficient than BSW, it has poor stability and the distribution of chunk sizes is too diverging.</description>

 My focus area right now is data chunking alogrithms. I&amp;rsquo;d jumped right into data chunking using hashing algorithms since those are popular and there are multiple papers on them.</description>

        <description>This is a review of the paper on Pattern matching in Z-compressed files. I&amp;rsquo;d done a project last year to implement LZW compression and chanced upon this paper while I was googling for some information on LZW. To see two areas that I&amp;rsquo;d worked on in the past - Data Search (Had helped build a search engine using Lucene 10 yrs back and used Solr for another project a few years back) and Data Compression come together, to know that we would be able to index data and search from compressed files without decompressing them, was very intersting and I wanted to find more information and see some implementation of this.</description>
