        <description>The following two quotes sum up my ideal of leadership.
&amp;ldquo;The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.&amp;rdquo; ~ Ronald Reagan
&amp;ldquo;A leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.</description>

        <description>Was listening to the awesome title sequence of His Dark Materials again today. It is one of those pieces of music that keep replaying in your mind even after you stop listening to it. I love listening to Intro sequence themes and there are some iconic ones among American TV shows.</description>

        <description>As a person who loves checking off items in &amp;lsquo;to-do&amp;rsquo; lists and checklists, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked books that have a list of rules/principles. Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.</description>

        <description>Background While writing a note about My Reading Journey, I was reminded that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t put a section on list of books related to Computer Science in My Reading List. Been thinking of doing that. Will do it one of these days. Today&amp;rsquo;s WSJ had a section in the end on Cybersecurity.</description>

        <description>In the post about my reading journey, I had mentioned a few poems that were my favorite. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d just put them all here. One place to come back to read them over and again!
The Arrow and the Song  I shot an arrow into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where;</description>

        <description>Last Updated - 06/06/2020
List of books that I have read, started to read, heard a lot about and want to read. I can at least talk one sentence about these books.
Have written a draft of my Reading Journey which is a short recollection of what I read when.</description>

        <description>&amp;ldquo;Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan &amp;lsquo;Press On&amp;rsquo; has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.</description>
