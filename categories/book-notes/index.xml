        <description>Thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading this book for over a month now. It has been truly inspirational. It is one of those books that when you read it and finish, you want to start reading again.</description>

        <description>Thoughts As I had mentioned in My Reading Journey, The Great Expectations was one of the first novels I read. I&amp;rsquo;ve read it so many times over the years, each time taking something away more than before.</description>

        <description>Thoughts This was the first Thomas Hardy novel that I&amp;rsquo;d read, probably during my engineering days, and re-reading it brings a lot of memories back. What I realize is that I got the gist of the story but had missed out on a lot of details that Hardy provides.</description>

        <description>Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks 1st Edition1
Thoughts There is no better time to read this book than now. We&amp;rsquo;re at a point in history where were have examples of massive data breaches in the past to study from, and also an unprecedented number of businesses going online at a rapid pace, accelerated by shelter-in-place rules enforced to stem the spread of covid-19 virus.</description>

        <description>I was introduced to The Knowledge Project by AJ last year during one of our 1-1 walks around the campus. He sent me the link to Naval Ravikant&amp;rsquo;s podcast after the walk, and I listened to it in the bus on the way back home.</description>

        <description>There are some novels that start slowly, and build up momentum as we progress through the story. And there are others that start with a bang.</description>

        <description>Jordan Peterson is one of those people who does not mince words. When you listen to his talks on YouTube, you always come back a little more pumped up and motivated than before.</description>

        <description>I&amp;rsquo;d always wanted to read a novel by Neal Stephenson. Back in 2005, NC had mentioned him as a great author who wrote cyber thrillers and I should definitely read.</description>

        <description>This is probably the 3rd time I&amp;rsquo;m reading this book. Got this book when I attended Payments 101 &amp;amp; 201 by Glenbrook in Jan/Feb 2015. It was just a couple of days but was one of the best courses I&amp;rsquo;ve attended.</description>

        <description>I like the writing style of Malcom Gladwell. With enchanting short real-life stories and fascinating anecdotes, he takes you right into the book, to a different world where you are a student who is observing and studying the behavior of the people in different parts of the world, effortlessly moving to and fro through different periods of time.</description>

        <description>There are many books that when I think back on them, I have this lingering feeling that either due to reading quickly or not taking notes, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really take in the full essence of the book.</description>
