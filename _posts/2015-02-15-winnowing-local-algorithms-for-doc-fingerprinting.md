**Paper reviewed**:

> Schleimer, S., Wilkerson, D. S., and Aiken, A. 2003. Winnowing: local algorithms for document fingerprinting. In Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (San Diego, California, USA, June 09 â€“ 12, 2003). 

Here are the different Data Chunking Algorithms

* Overlap
	* K-gram algorithm 
	* 0 mod p algorithm 
	* **Winnowing algorithm** 

* Non-Overlap 
	* Hash-breaking 

Wanted to learn more on data chunking algorithms. Last paper focused on non-overlap method. This has more information on overlap methods.
