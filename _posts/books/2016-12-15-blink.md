**_blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking_** by Malcom Gladwell

----

_I like the writing style of Malcom Gladwell. With enchanting short real-life stories and fascinating anecdotes, he takes you right into the book, to a different world where you are a student who is observing and studying the behavior of the people in different parts of the world, effortlessly moving to and fro through different periods of time._

### INTRODUCTION - The Statue That Didn’t Look Right 

1. Fast and Frugal
2. The Internal Computer
3. A Different and Better World

_This chapter tells the story of a kouros that was purchased by Paul Getty museum. The museum authorities had certified it as legitimate after over 2 years of research. But during the opening, some art historians and other experts 'felt' that it was fake by just looking at it._

> In the first two seconds of looking — in a single glance — they were able to understand more about the essence of the statue than the team at the Getty was able to understand after fourteen months.
> **Blink is a book about those first two seconds**.

_The chapter lays a foundation for what the book is about and is a very engaging introduction to keep you from putting the book down._ 

### ONE - The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way
1. The Love Lab
2. Marriage and Morse Code
3. The Importance of Contempt
4. The Secrets of the Bedroom
5. Listening to Doctors
6. The Power of the Glance

_The chapter starts with the story of a couple in their twenties - Bill & Susan - who go to the University of Washington to visit the laboratory of a psychologist named John Gottman. They talk about their dog and Gottman videotapes the conversation for 15 minutes. Gottman and team then assign a SPAFF code to every second of the couple's interaction. [SPAFF code assigns a number to every emotion - Disgust is 1, contempt is 2, anger is 7, defensiveness is 10 .. and so on]. Gottman has proven that he got 95% success of predicting whether a marriage will endure or not by using 1 hour of video and 90% success by 15 minutes._ 

> To make an accurate prediction about something as serious as the future of a marriage indeed, to make a prediction of any sort — it seems that we would have to gather a lot of information and in as many different contexts as possible.
> But John Gottman has proven that we don’t have to do that at all.

_He goes further to say that of all the emotions in the SPAFF code, he can find out much about a couple by just focusing on what he calls the "Four Horsemen": **defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt**. Of these 4, contempt is the most important of them all. Criticism is good in a relationship but contempt is very bad._ 

> ..presence of contempt in a marriage can even predict such things as how many colds a husband or a wife gets; in other words, having someone you love express contempt toward you is so stressful that it begins to affect the functioning of your immune system.
