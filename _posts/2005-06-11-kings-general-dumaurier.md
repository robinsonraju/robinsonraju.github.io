The “The Kings General” is unlike any novel that I’ve read. It’s as pacy as any modern day thriller. Reminds me of “Gone with the wind” though. It is about Richard Grenvile , the king’s General in the west , the bravest amongst the brave , the lion of the times , the king’s darling , the rebels’ dread and about the only woman in the world he cared for : Honor Harris – a beautiful lady who was crippled just a day before their marriage in a tragic accident.

The novel is a first person narrative by Honor and from the time it starts with her brother Kit’s marriage to Gartred Grenvile , events unfurl one after another so quickly that within no time you would find yourself in Menabilly amidst a raging civil war between the forces of the King and the Parliament , pausing probably in the middle during the accident which cripples Honor , more due to shock than because the story slackens in pace there.
(i'll edit this to put in more about the novel later :) )
