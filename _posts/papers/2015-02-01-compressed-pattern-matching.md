This is a review of the paper on Pattern matching in Z-compressed files. I'd done a project last year to implement LZW compression and chanced upon this paper while I was googling for some information on LZW. To see two areas that I'd worked on in the past - Data Search (Had helped build a search engine using Lucene 10 yrs back and used Solr for another project a few years back) and Data Compression come together, to know that we would be able to index data and search from compressed files without decompressing them, was very intersting and I wanted to find more information and see some implementation of this.  
The review of the paper was presented to some students at SJSU. 

**Paper reviewed**:

> Amir, A., Benson, G., & Farach, M. (1996). Let sleeping files lie: Pattern matching in Z-compressed file. Journal of System Sciences, 52, 299-307.

The presetation had the following sections - 

* Overview of Data compression
* Details about LZW compression
* Compressed Pattern Matching

**TBD** Hope to put the ppt here (once I learn to use reveal.js here!)
