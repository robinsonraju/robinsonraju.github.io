> Zhanjie, W., & Lang, S. (2013). Research on Distributional Stability of Chunk Sizes in Data Chunking. International Journal of Digital Content Technology and Its Applications, 443-450.

Couple of weeks back we'd reviewed TTTD algorithm and an improvement of TTTD. While TTTD can chunk data according to data content and is more efficient than BSW, it has poor stability and the distribution of chunk sizes is too diverging. 

This paper documents research done on distribution of chunk sizes and proposes Two Directions Sliding Window (TDSW) Algorithm for solving the distribution issue.  The paper also talks about experiments with TDSW algorithm which show that there is a reduction of 30% in unbiased variance 
and 50% in running time.
