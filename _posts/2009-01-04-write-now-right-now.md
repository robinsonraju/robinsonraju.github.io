A has given me the ultimatum.
"It is too much. You've been fooling me for more than a year. Write now. Just 10 minutes. Whatever comes to your mind"
She's been hitting the url for over a year expecting me to surprise her by writing something and I've always been saying.. I will, I will. 
But more than a year of procrastination is bad I guess. At least for your loved one's patience ...
It's coming, the pasting of a new rainbow butterfly in a fresh page.. in moments. 
10 minutes if you want to time it. 
Go, now !
