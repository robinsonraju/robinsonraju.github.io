everyone seems to be blogging.
is that why i want to blog ? nopes . i have this strong tendency to go retro from the direction that the crowd is going . so thats not the reason. anyway , let me make my tendencies a subject of another post.
back to why i thought of blogging , i am freeeeeeeeeeeeeee
so totally free that i need to just come to the office , drink coffee , have lunch , drink coffee again and then rush home . well ! somewhere in the middle , i stuff in a task called "check mails" .
moreover, i always wanted to 'write' something.
now that i have time and have done the great thing of starting to put pen on paper (ePen on ePaper rather) , i guess words will flow .
