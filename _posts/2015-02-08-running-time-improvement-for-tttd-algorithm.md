Last week I spent some time understanding hash-based data deduplication systems. It felt great to revisit Rabin-Karp Algorithm for string matching. This algorithm was my focus in CS 255 and I had implemented it using Monte Carlo and Las Vegas approaches (A Monte Carlo algorithm has a guaranteed completion time but fails to output a correct answer with a small probability, A Las Vegas algorithm has guaranteed correctness but fails to complete with a small probability). 
Before trying to dedupe data, it needs to be chunked. There are many algorithms to do that. The Basic Sliding Window (BSW) algorithm is one of the earliest and widely used. The Two Thresholds Two Divisors (TTTD) algorithm is an improvement over this. 
This paper proposes an improvement over the TTTD algorithm. 

I still need to find a better system to embed a presentation in a static page. For now using issuu. 
<div data-configid="18778196/14985334" style="width:625px; height:500px;" class="issuuembed"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="//e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script>
