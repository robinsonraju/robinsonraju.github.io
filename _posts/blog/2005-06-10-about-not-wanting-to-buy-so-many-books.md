Much as I want to buy as many books as I want , I don’t like being forced into book-buying , to feel that I’ve done something which I could’ve avoided. That’s exactly what happens when I go to Church street / MG Road. Blossoms, Gangarams, HigginBothams, LB publishers, Crossword ; so many book shops each just a hop away from each other that almost all the time , I’d just enter one , lose my whole evening , and most of time feel : “this is the time to buy , what if I am short of cash tomorrow ? What if I get so busy that I cannot come here? Moreover I’m getting a discount here” … mind always finds some reason. Only after I leave the book shop would the impact hit me ; that my pockets just got shallower.
The latest book-buying was just a couple of weeks back. Had gone there to meet a friend. Saw Blossoms. Thought , 'I anyway have another 30 mins to go. lemme check out the books. just see not buy.' Went in and immediately remembered my friend telling me about “The King's General” by Daphne du Maurier. OK . Bought that and 3 more - Barclays study guide to St.Mark’s Gospel , S K George’s Story of Bible and an omnibus containing all Sherlock holmes stories. Regrets ? No . I love these books.
