I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge.<br>
That myth is more potent than history.<br>
That dreams are more powerful than facts.<br>
That hope always triumphs over experience.<br>
That laughter is the only cure for grief.<br>
And I believe that love is stronger than death.<br>

This is from a book named ‘All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten’. D was so ecstatic about it on the phone that I ordered the book online as soon as I got a chance. If not anything, I was enchanted by the name. It took 2 weeks to get shipped to me though. Got it today. Smiled and laughed all the way to the end while reading it.
