S called. Before he started speaking, I knew what he’d say. Let’s meet up and study something. Yeah ! it’s been over a month since 2nd semester started and we hadn’t even looked into the books list. EC1 was a couple of weeks ahead. It was time.
He was in Stanford meeting up with some friend. He wanted to catch up with me in the library after lunch.

S - “Library le meet pannalam. Books list eduthuko. We’ll find them there and also plan for studying for this sem. ”

Me – “Wokay. I have some work in the bank. Athu mudichittu, I’ll leave to library.”

As planned, we met in the library but couldn’t find the books. They’d all been taken. After talking about textbooks for a while, the conversation just slipped into movies and songs.

Me - “Have you heard this song ‘Ragasiyamanadu kaadal’ ? A gem of a song. I was listening to top 10 on raaga yesterday and came upon this .. Quite accidentally”

S - “Haven’t heard of it. New song ? Which movie ?”

“Kodambakkam”

“k. Have you listened to ‘New york nagaram’ ? A R Rahman is back to Tamil. He’s simply awesome. You heard his other songs ?”

“Sure. I love his songs.”

Soon we were talking about movies. He’s a big time Kamal fan. So spoke about the much awaited ‘Vettayadu Vilayadu’ and old hit movies like 16 Vayathinile , Apoorva Sahodarangal, Indian …

I sometime feel that talking about a movie brings the best out of a person. Being a movie buff myself, I've felt really happy whenever I’ve lost myself fully into a movie. A good movie is like a drug. When you’re seeing it the surrounding just disappears. Same with a good song. You could close your eyes and totally get lost in it.

As I was listening to A R Rahman’s ‘New York Nagaram’, I thought I’d write down my top 5 movies and songs. Also, I’d been wanting to put such a list in orkut for long.
