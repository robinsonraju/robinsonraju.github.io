Though sleeping, reading and watching movies were the only major things that I did during this weekend, what I really wanted to do was to go to a beach, write something, put it into a bottle and throw it into the sea.<br>
Yeah ! Yes ! just like that !<br>
Much as I'd like to think that someone'll pick it up and read and mail and .. <br>
Nothing..
