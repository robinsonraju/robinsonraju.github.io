A project delivery is a culmination of the team’s effort after a series of sprints. After a several sequences of twists and turns or crests and troughs of requirement/direction changes, the team is finally at the juncture where it has produced a product that the client wanted. The client has been involved in the process from the beginning, so nothing should be a surprise. Project delivery is also an opportunity to showcase the product to a broader audience than the immediate client that the team has been working on. Now comes the question of presenting the product to an audience that is not aware of the product yet. Worse, the audience may be very diverse in their technical or domain knowledge. How do we go about creating a presentation that appeals to all.

A common rule of thumb for presentations is to go with the least common denominator in the audience who is significant enough. If the person with the least technical knowledge understands your framework, it is a win. There is always more hardwork in creating a simple presentation than a complex one. One usually starts by creating a presentation with all details in it and then stripping it slowly of the complexities layer by layer, in the end leaving only the most vital information that could be understood by all. After all, we’re investing time and energy, the audience is expecting to get something and if we disappoint, the ramifications could be disastrous. The audience may never come back even if the next product is stellar.

The objective is very simple – grab audience’s attention and keep it.

As the picture above shows, audience will naturally lose interest with time. The key is to find out what interested the audience in the beginning – is it curiosity, is it a joke that you told in the beginning ? Each audience is unique, so you would have to determine what works for a specific audience at that time. Whatever works, use that technique often so that you can bring the audience to a higher attention span than they normally would be in.

Also, always remember to keep the presentation simple and easy to remember.

If you’re successful, the audience will be engaged, they would have a good opinion about the product and also good knowledge about the product to make the right choices.
