        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2006-05-15-appearances-are-deceptive/ -&lt;p&gt;Gosh ! I jus came to know that A’d changed from specs to lenses. When ? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Now I got it ! I met him last week.. that too after a gap of a year ! he asked if I noticed any change in him. I get into this confused-i-wanna-chicken-out kind of state when someone asks me this !&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
I think I’d said “haha .. you look exactly the same. You don’t eat much. Do you ? I guess I too haven’t changed much.”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
(A might’ve been thinking – ‘bummer! I’ve gotten rid my specs and you don’t even notice the difference ! grr !!’)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This’s been a problem which, for a long time I never knew ! Some friend wears a new dress or gets a new get-up and I never notice. The fact of the matter is, this hurts people…sometimes. v
Once I thought I’d fix it … &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
had told myself “watch it ! from today .. I’m gonna get more interested in the ‘appearance’” &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very next day I caught P coming to office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me – “hey P, you look different ! you’ve started wearing specs, haven’t you ? Cool ! I must say you now look your true intellectual self.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really happy I that I noticed some change as soon as I wanted to. Man ! there is nothing in life that you can’t learn once you put your mind into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P’d looked at me curiously and laughed – “what’s wrong with you? I’ve been wearing specs from high school”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for bothering about looks ! I guess I’ll have to stick to what people feel, like or read !&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A time to celebrate</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2006-05-07-time-to-celebrate/</link>

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2006-05-07-time-to-celebrate/ -&lt;p&gt;St.George’s festival. Theophilus thirumeni (formerly MC Cherian achen) went over St. George’s life – the same story that had been told to me many times as a kid – more so because I had this paranoid fear of snakes. I’ve had moments in which I missed stamping on a snake or a snake bite by sheer luck ! If you said there was just one in a million chance to see a snake in the city of Bangalore.. yes.. may be.. but there is that one in a million..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a photo of him, St.George – an old, almost faded, small but framed one, in which the brave hero stands face to face with the dragon with a spear in his hand on a white horse . He is staring into the dragon’s eyes and the open mouthed dragon is lunging towards him. The dragon isn’t afraid and he isn’t even a bit scared !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takes me back to the times when we used to go to kerala during summer vacations. Everything seemed to happen right during that time. Mango’s came at that time. It rained at that time. And this perunal too. It was one time we could have the most delicious of kozhi (chicken) currys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also the day of Mexican celebration – Cinco de Mayo (simply means – the 5th of May). As I was returning home I could see a lot of people on the streets holding the Mexican flag. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
We went to the park in the evening. Guardalupe park was full of people. After coming from India I’d never seen so many people together in one single place. There were many stalls. There were a couple of stages in which some bands were playing. The music was good. There was a dancing corner. But I didn’t try it out. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
There are a few things that I can best do alone ! dancing may be one of them !!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A beautiful day</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2006-04-30-a-beautiful-day/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I did was to watch the rest of &amp;lsquo;The Sound of Music&#39;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
The &amp;lsquo;favourite things&amp;rsquo; song was still afresh in my mind. I&amp;rsquo;d watched it till Maria stealthily ran away to the abbey. D had said it was the best of movies ! must-watch-should-not-be-missed kind of movie. It is a musical about a wannabe nun being a governess in a Captains house (palace!) gaining the confidence of his 7 kids. It’s a classic. It’s a jolly ride, I’d say – jolly roller coaster musical flow in and out of good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I finished everyone was awake.. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
N, reading paper – &amp;ldquo;They’ve opened a new park near downtown. Let’s go.&amp;rdquo; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Me – &amp;ldquo;Yup..I anyway needed to go to the library.&amp;rdquo; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
N – “ok. We’ll cook something, take it and eat it from there.”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Me – “We’ll eat here and then go there. I don’t like to eat in open spaces.”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
N – “It’ll be cool to eat in the park. It’ll be like a picnic. We’ll eat there.”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May be because I’ve seen too many parks littered with leftovers .. I don’t like to eat in parks. Aren’t parks meant to be .. I don’t know .. heaven-in-the-middle-of-rubble or something ? a serene place ? a place where you just sat silently or walked slowly or.. whatever.. well ! it’s my personal prob. I’d rather not impose my ideas into someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the library .. and to my surprise saw that there was a book sale going on there. Bought some books. That kind of put me back into good spirits. Called up N to find out if he was coming to the park. He was ready. We found the park, sat on the green grass.. Using bag as pillow I lay flat on the grass and started reading ‘message in a bottle’. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
N unpacked and had his lunch. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
After a while he turned towards me .. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
“How was the sale ? what did you buy ?”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
“Not many .. arnd 5.”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
N inspected . he put aside ‘Frenchman’s Creek’ , ‘Life of Pi’ …and other books. I knew his eye’d stop at Republic and it did ! ‘Plato’s Republic ! boy ! I always wanted to read it..’ He started reading it and before long, WE started reading it. The whole book’s in the form of dialogues. He read a dialogue and I the next. We played Socrates, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus alternatively .. and even as we were returning home.. we were arguing .. about ‘justice’&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2006-03-19-francisco-d-anconia-speech-money/ -&lt;h3 id=&#34;fransisco-danconias-speech-from-atlas-shrugged1-when-someone-says-money-is-the-root-of-all-evil&#34;&gt;Fransisco d&amp;rsquo;Anconia&amp;rsquo;s speech from &lt;strong&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when someone says &amp;ldquo;Money is the root of all evil&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;So you think that money is the root of all evil?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; said Francisco d&amp;rsquo;Anconia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can&amp;rsquo;t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor—your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money, Is this what you consider evil?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions—and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn that man&amp;rsquo;s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man&amp;rsquo;s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made—before it can be looted or mooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can&amp;rsquo;t consume more than he has produced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss—the recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your misery—that you must offer them values, not wounds—that the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men&amp;rsquo;s stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by trade—with reason, not force, as their final arbiter—it is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest ability—and the degree of a man&amp;rsquo;s productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider evil?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality—the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if he&amp;rsquo;s evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if he&amp;rsquo;s evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his money. Is this the reason why you call it evil?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth—the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your money by fraud? By pandering to men&amp;rsquo;s vices or men&amp;rsquo;s stupidity? By catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your money will not give you a moment&amp;rsquo;s or a penny&amp;rsquo;s worth of joy. Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then you&amp;rsquo;ll scream that money is evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of money?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Money is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or did you say it&amp;rsquo;s the love of money that&amp;rsquo;s the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. It&amp;rsquo;s the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money—and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me give you a tip on a clue to men&amp;rsquo;s characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper&amp;rsquo;s bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another—their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich—will not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guilt—and of his life, as he deserves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standard—the men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money—the men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-law—men who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victims—then money becomes its creators&amp;rsquo; avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they&amp;rsquo;ve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a society&amp;rsquo;s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion—when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing—when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors—when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don&amp;rsquo;t protect you against them, but protect them against you—when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice—you may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that is does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men&amp;rsquo;s protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, &amp;lsquo;Account overdrawn.&#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, &amp;lsquo;Who is destroying the world? You are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why it&amp;rsquo;s crumbling around you, while you&amp;rsquo;re damning its life-blood—money. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout men&amp;rsquo;s history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slaves—slaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebody&amp;rsquo;s mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepers—as industrialists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a country of money—and I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, man&amp;rsquo;s mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human being—the self-made man—the American industrialist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choose—because it contains all the others—the fact that they were the people who created the phrase &amp;lsquo;to make money.&amp;rsquo; No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity—to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted of obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words &amp;lsquo;to make money&amp;rsquo; hold the essence of human morality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters&amp;rsquo; continents. Now the looters&amp;rsquo; credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide— as, I think, he will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns—or dollars. Take your choice—there is no other—and your time is running out.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is from a book named ‘All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten’. D was so ecstatic about it on the phone that I ordered the book online as soon as I got a chance. If not anything, I was enchanted by the name. It took 2 weeks to get shipped to me though. Got it today. Smiled and laughed all the way to the end while reading it.&lt;/p&gt;

C took us to the most famous sea food restaurant here. ABC seafood center ! We spent a good 20 minutes to find a place to park only to find over 20 people waiting in line. But luckily C had arranged for everything and we just had to go to the table where he and other team members were sitting. But I wondered.. why so many? what do they sell here? why so many people? The restaurant was a huge circular hall and it looked same from all sides. Seemed as though there were circular tables all over and the same group of people sitting around every table. I looked again .. and again. They looked so alike. It is difficult to tell one Chinese from another and the big crowd in front gave the impression of 100s of duplicates sitting next to each other and chattering. There .. a vision of unity, of co-operation, of singleness of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience means recognizing patterns. Attribute the observed pattern to something that you have already done. If you have competence in that field, you must have done something similar. You must have read about something on similar lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time back RV had told me what he had learnt in some programme that he had attended - about different levels of competence. There are 4 levels of competence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconscious Incompetence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conscious Incompetence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conscious Competence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconscious Competence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in the first stage if you don’t know that you don’t know. The second stage is when you know that you don’t know. The third is when you know that you know. The fourth when you, after having transcended the knowing stage, aren’t even aware that you know. For instance, when you become very adept at driving, you can do it skillfully without even concentrating on it. Is it possible that you have qualities that put you in level 4 directly with regards to doing things ? That you are gifted from birth ? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Nah ! you gotta work for it. Only experience can get you to level 4 when you can perform the magic of doing a task in 2 hours which a CC would take 3 days, CI couple of weeks and a UI cannot hope to do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2006-01-25-sanguine-tale/ -&lt;p&gt;The good soul decides to do something good. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
He feels happy about the great deed he is about to perform.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
In his mind he sees obscure faces of people whom he might save.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
When he had done it in the past, he had felt weak and had gone home and slept .. slept and slept. As it happens with him often, he sees himself in the future. He sees him self after the deed. He sees himself being weak, weak to even type. He sees himself being drowsy in the 3 PM meeting which he is required to attend. His colleagues ask him why he is so pale. Is he not well or something ? He wants to tell them. But he says ‘Nothing, nothing .. I’m OK. Just didn’t get enough sleep. It was too cold yesterday.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock strikes 2 and he gets out of the reverie. It is time. He gets up with a smile and heads towards the gym. That’s where the blood donation drive is to happen.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
He returns faster than he goes. He is seen smiling wildly as though something’s hit him. Internally he is laughing , laughing loudly at the ridiculousness of it all.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Meets V on the way.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
V – “Where were you man, went out ?”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
H – “Yup..Thought I’d donate blood”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
V(with this what’s-wrong-with-him kind of look) – “Really ? ”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
H - “Couldn’t do it though. The doc says - India is (blacklisted as) a malaria-prone country. You need to be in the US for 3 years(continuously) to give blood.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2006-01-23-all-charged-up-for-nothing/ -&lt;p&gt;Ever started your day in the office with a rude shock? I mean, shock in the literal sense. I’ve discovered that being a good chap who switches off his monitor before calling it a day (to save power!) has its disadvantages, especially if he is a ..err..&amp;lsquo;static electric&amp;rsquo; person – someone who gets a shock even before he touches the metal switch to turn on the power. If I were a man of action I’d be benumbed for a second, taken aback by the momentary loss of sense before coming to terms with things around. But no..I’m what you could call as a man of dreams (If you ever catch me smiling/laughing/angered/dull or exhibiting some out-of-the-place emotion while idly walking on some road alone, be not alarmed, you’ve not lost me). So, this shock is usually a jolt from the dreamy-unreal-fantasy world to the present. It’s as though some one’s stopped me on my tracks.. &amp;ldquo;Boy. It’s time, time to work. Ready .. Steady .. Go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.30 AM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Yes. Time to work. Do one thing at a time, I tell myself. No dreaming and letting the mind wander. I let my mind and fingers take over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.00 AM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
My fingers are tapping the unfortunate keyboard incessantly and furiously. I suddenly stop. Something is disturbing me. What is it ? I look back. Sheesh ! someone’s opened the darn window. The wind’s blowing. I go towards it and before I even touch it …trrrr.. I get a shock . I look here and there. To see if someone saw. None. I close the window. pull the strings down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.00 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
I’m hungry. But V likes lunch only after 1.30 ..closer to 2.00 if he has urgent work. So I decide to grab a coke in the meanwhile. I tell myself – ‘This coke machine always gives me shock. But not this time’. So to ‘discharge’ static electricity off me, I touch everything around, the chair, the phone, the table and set off. On the way I think – ‘anyway I’ve got up. Let me take a leak’. 100 out of 100 times I meet up with a few friends in the restroom. We come out of it, talk this and that and head to the pantry. N goes for apple juice, S goes for pepsi and I go for coke. The moment I touch the ‘diet coke’ button, a shiver runs though my fingers. Duh ! so much for my preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.00 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
I sense a presence. It is A, a Mangalore chap. (Why in the world did they change Bangalore to Bengalooru? Why not name Mangalore as Mengalooru? To the kannada deprived, “Men-gala-ooru = town of men” Well ! May be the name is reserved for future men-only cities which could spawn up due to the high rate of female infanticide). I try to shake hands with him and you know what happened (by this time you are the i-know-what-happened guru). I just barely touch him and …Trrrrrrr.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
A - “En siva .. electricity ittkondu oodadthiya ?”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
(“What buddy, you walk around with electricity or what ?”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.00 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
I decide to blog the events of the day. It’s been sometime. I mean since I’ve written something. Boy, whatta day. Someone could as well say &amp;ldquo;Robin, I think of you and I see sparks flying!&amp;rdquo; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
I take a walk. Conjure up what to write and bingo !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ps: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Wouldn’t it be fanciful to visualize me sitting in a place for a long time, building up so much of static electricity that with a stroke of a finger, I could light a bulb. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
That’d be pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pps :&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
Gosh ! why do I never talk like an engineer ? I might be the only engineer who limits logical reasoning only to work and nothing beyond ..that too only if I’m asked to! &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget that.. Why does this happen ? &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
The actual reason(s) could be one or many of&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
a. dry skin&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
b. clothes&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
c. complete lack of moisture in the air&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
d. what-ever-you-want-to-assume to amuse yourself&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Cousin Rachel by Daphne du Maurier</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-17-my-cousin-rachel-daphne-du-maurier/</link>

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-17-my-cousin-rachel-daphne-du-maurier/ -&lt;h2 id=&#34;617&#34;&gt;6/17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Krishna’s wedding. Krishna, my closest pal during childhood; my first best friend (first best friend !! does that sound strange ? well ! at different times in life I had different best friends. Guys with whom I had nothing to hide and who hid nothing from me. My brothers.) All day I was wondering what to give. He generally was fond of things carved out of glass. The only doubt was whether he still liked showpieces . well, I thought I’d go to the shop and decide. Brigades was on the way. I decided to put at stop at Archies there to choose a gift. As always there was no place to park. Went downwards alng Church Street looking for a space. Drove, drove and drove .. finally found a place to park. Turned around to see something that I would always love to see. Blossoms. Something was going on. Was it being renovated ? No, this was the newly furnished ground floor and was still being filled with books. I went to the first floor – straight to the du Maurier section. Eyes sought ‘My cousin Rachel’ . There it was – a greenish book with a lady draped in a green shawl looking directly at me. Behind her was a house, a villa. The villa was a bit far off. Between the villa and her one could see a lot of greenery. Trees all around and a well maintained lawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned the book and started with what was written on the back cover (I hate reading whatever is written in the back cover. I feel it somehow gives away the author, somehow cheats me, somehow doesn’t give me the right to let the events unwind in my mind since I start expecting things to happen. My best readings have come from books of which I hadn’t read an introduction, of which I knew nothing, expected nothing. I don’t know how many of you like to see movie trailers or would enjoy the movie after you have been told the story.) Anyway, the crime was committed. I read it in a single go ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ambrose married Rachel and never returned home. His letters to his cousin hinted that he was being poisoned and when Philip arrived in Italy, Ambrose was dead…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll put a stop to Gorky and start with du Maurier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;620&#34;&gt;6/20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a flashback. Philip’s flashback. It’s about him recounting the events that haunt him. Philip ? Philip in ‘The Mill on the floss’ had a hunchback, Philip in ‘Of Human Bondage’ had a clubfoot, what disadvantage does this Philip have ? None? He is orphaned, yes, but none with his physique, something with the psyche though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the narrative starts with Tom Jenkyn’s hanging that he had witnessed in his childhood, you wonder why he is telling about it and as you go further, you tend to dismiss it as some bad happening that he had witnessed as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lost his parents at a very young age he was brought up by Ambrose, his cousin. Ambrose was everything to Philip, He was Philip’s father, mother, guardian, teacher, role model – all in one. Ambrose is unmarried, is very passionate about garden, always trying to gather some rare shrub to plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story starts with a middle aged Ambrose not being able to withstand winters in England. He is advised to go to a hotter place and this time Ambrose decides to go to Italy. From Italy he writes to Philip often. In one of his letters he mentions about meeting a distant cousin of theirs, cousin Rachel. In the next few letters he is all words about Rachel, describing her interest in gardening and trees. The letter after that comes with the news of him being married to Rachel. This is a shock to Philip and he feels as though someone has taken Ambrose away from him. But he conveys the news to his neighbours who are really happy upon hearing the news. The letters from Ambrose stop coming. After a long time, Philip gets a very short letter from Ambrose, in illegible handwriting , hinting that his wife is trying to kill him. Philip gets alarmed, speaks to his godfather Nick Kendal, who says Ambrose might not be well and that he might have tumour in the head that his father had.
Philip sets out to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;621&#34;&gt;6/21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way he gets a mail from Ambrose asking him to leave to Italy immediately. With great difficulty he get to Florence and when he reaches the Sangaletti villa, he is informed that Ambrose is dead. Philip is almost devastated and inconsolable. He could not even imagine that he would never see Ambrose again. He comes to know that Rachel has left the place taking away all of Ambrose&amp;rsquo;s possessions except for a hat. Philip takes the hat and sets out to meet Rachel&amp;rsquo;s friend Rainaldi. Rainaldi is a matter-of-fact businesslike person and Philip takes an immediate dislike for him.
Philip sets back to England. After a few months, he is called by his godfather Nick who tells him about a mail from Rachel. Rachel was planning to come to visit them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Makar Chudra by Maxim Gorky</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-15-makar-chudra-maxim-gorky/</link>

        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-15-makar-chudra-maxim-gorky/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-15-makar-chudra-maxim-gorky/ -&lt;p&gt;The story starts with Makar , an aged gypsy conversing with the author. It is dark , the wind is heavy , the campfire is blazing furiously ..yet Makar , smoking his huge pipe , was unfazed. It was as though these heavy conditions never affected him.(reminds me of Vikram-Betal stories of chandamama ! it was dark , the night was heavy , yet Vikram was unfazed. He climbed the tree , pulled the corpse out . as he started walking away with it , the corpse on his shoulder came to life !!!) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makar is of the opinion that people are born to travel; that there is nothing better than traveling. “A curious lot people are ; they herd together trampling on each other when there is so much of space-” . he asks why a man should be ploughing a field . “A man who ploughs land pours his strength into the land. He not only loses his strength but also his freedom. He is tied to the soil. I have traveled so much , seen so much and learnt so much that you would require a 1000 bags of paper to put them all in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait , wait ! what’s happening ? is this the story of an old gypsy and his philosophy ? dear pal , it certainly is not. who , in reality is he in the story ? No one. He is less significant that the phone operator in my office who connects me to some important person outside whom I wish to speak to . The story belongs to the fearless youth Loiko Zobar or does it belong to the beautiful but vicious Radda ? Let us pace towards them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk stops when they hear Nonka , Makar’s daughter singing. The author looks at her and is fascinated by her beauty. Makar says “you would like to have a beautiful maid like her to fall in love with you . wouldn’t you ? No good for you. Put no faith in women. Once you kiss one , all your freedom is gone. You will come to ruins. Let me tell you a story -”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loiko Zobar was a fearless youth who was famous across the whole of steppes. If he ever took fancy to something , it was his . He traveled hither and tither as he pleased. There were at least 10 men in each village who had sworn to take his head. But they couldn’t even touch a hair on his head. It was said that he could even knife the devil if he came in his way.
“His moustaches swept down his shoulders , where they mingled with his hair; his eyes shone like two bright stars, and his smile was sun itself. ..When he looked into your eyes, your soul surrendered to him, and instead of being ashamed of this, you were proud of it. You seemed to always become better in his presence.”
(Though I see Richard Grenvile in every brave man whom I read of , if I were to write about Richard , the description would match the one above – word to word.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radda was the queen among beauties. A man could not but be rooted to the place where he stood if he saw her. “No words could ever describe Radda’s beauty. Perhaps it could be played on a violin , but only by one who knew the instrument as he knew his soul.”
Many many men asked for her hand but she refused. A rich man was so dumbstruck with her beauty that he was ready to give away everything for her sake. But she was too haughty. To the rich man her reply was “if the eagle’s mate went into the nest of a crow of her own will, what would you think of her ? ”. Likewise she mocked at everyone who asked her hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of his travels , Zobar chanced to come to the camp that Radda was in.
….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At once smitten by Radda’s beauty he tries to woo her. But she finds his talk humourless, finds his music bland, she doesn’t in anyway relent to him. Zobar plunges into deep despair and is seen playing his fiddle throughout the night. He is so brilliant with the fiddle, that his music melts everyone’s heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You felt that tune with every fibre of your body, and you became a slave of it. And if at that moment Zobar had called out ‘out with your knives, comrades’, every man would have bared his knife against anyone he pointed out. He could wind a person with his little finger, but everyone loved him dearly”. Such was Zobar’s effect on all. Yet Radda would have nothing at all of it. She mocked him continuously. While all others appreciated every song that he sang, she vehemently criticised them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not finding a way to make her approve of him directly, Zobar approaches Danilo, Radda’s father. Danilo approves; says “Take her if you can” . Radda is seen sitting on a horse and Zobar approaches her. He says he has seen many a woman but none as fiery and beautiful as her. He asks her to be his wife but warns her that being his wife doesn’t mean that she would be able to curb his freedom. In reply she lashes her whip at him. The whip catches his feet and pulls him down. He falls on the ground on the back of his head. Radda has a wild grin on her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he limps away Radda dismounts from the horse and comes towards him. As soon as she is near him, Zobar goes for his knife, Radda pulls her pistol out. She tells him that she is ready for truce, that she finds him the bravest man in the whole of steppe, the only one who could ever stand up to her. She presents a proposition before him . If she has to be his wife he has to touch her feet in front of every one around and then kiss her hand. She tells him that her passionate kisses and caresses are just waiting for him. Under their effect he will forget the brave life he led in the past and be a servant of her for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone finds it distasteful that Zobar has to touch her feet. Zobar says nothing, he goes away. He is seen thinking the whole night, sometimes playing sad tones with his fiddle in the night .
The next day comes . Zobar tells his comrades that he will touch her feet but he needed to test how strong her heart was. Zobar walks towards Radda , goes close to her and plunges his knife into her heart. She pulls the knife out and moments before life went out of her she said “Farewell Zobar. I knew you would do it”. As the stunned crowd sees a lifeless Radda fall down, Zobar throws himself on her feet. Moments later everyone is still silent as Zobar gets up and starts to walk away. It was then that Danilo Rushes towards Zobar and thrusts his knife to the back of his heart. Zobar falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image of Radda and Zobar lying dead keeps circling in the author&amp;rsquo;s mind, but Makar continues smoking his huge cigar.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/books/2005-06-11-kings-general-dumaurier/ -&lt;p&gt;The “The Kings General” is unlike any novel that I’ve read. It’s as pacy as a modern day thriller. Reminds me of “Gone with the wind” though. It is about Richard Grenvile, the king’s General in the west, the bravest amongst the brave, the lion of the times, the king’s darling, the rebels’ dread and about the only woman in the world he cared for : Honor Harris – a beautiful lady who was crippled just a day before their marriage in a tragic accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel is a first person narrative by Honor and from the time it starts with her brother Kit’s marriage to Gartred Grenvile, events unfurl one after another so quickly that within no time you would find yourself in Menabilly amidst a raging civil war between the forces of the King and the Parliament, pausing probably in the middle during the accident which cripples Honor, more due to shock than because the story slackens in pace there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>about not wanting to buy so many books</title>

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2005-06-10-about-not-wanting-to-buy-so-many-books/ -&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much as I want to buy as many books as I want , I don’t like being forced into book-buying , to feel that I’ve done something which I could’ve avoided. That’s exactly what happens when I go to Church street / MG Road. Blossoms, Gangarams, HigginBothams, LB publishers, Crossword ; so many book shops each just a hop away from each other that almost all the time , I’d just enter one , lose my whole evening , and most of time feel : “this is the time to buy , what if I am short of cash tomorrow ? What if I get so busy that I cannot come here? Moreover I’m getting a discount here” … mind always finds some reason. Only after I leave the book shop would the impact hit me ; that my pockets just got shallower.
The latest book-buying was just a couple of weeks back. Had gone there to meet a friend. Saw Blossoms. Thought , &amp;lsquo;I anyway have another 30 mins to go. lemme check out the books. just see not buy.&amp;rsquo; Went in and immediately remembered my friend telling me about “The King&amp;rsquo;s General” by Daphne du Maurier. OK . Bought that and 3 more - Barclays study guide to St.Mark’s Gospel , S K George’s Story of Bible and an omnibus containing all Sherlock holmes stories. Regrets ? No . I love these books.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2005-06-07-here-cometh-time-to-blog/ -&lt;p&gt;everyone seems to be blogging.
is that why i want to blog ? nopes . i have this strong tendency to go retro from the direction that the crowd is going . so thats not the reason. anyway , let me make my tendencies a subject of another post.
back to why i thought of blogging , i am freeeeeeeeeeeeeee
so totally free that i need to just come to the office , drink coffee , have lunch , drink coffee again and then rush home . well ! somewhere in the middle , i stuff in a task called &amp;ldquo;check mails&amp;rdquo; .
moreover, i always wanted to &amp;lsquo;write&amp;rsquo; something.
now that i have time and have done the great thing of starting to put pen on paper (ePen on ePaper rather) , i guess words will flow .&lt;/p&gt;
