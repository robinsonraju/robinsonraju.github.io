{"About-Me":{"title":"About","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n“I’m an open book, but you’ve got to know how to read me.”\n\nHi there! I’m Rob.\nI also go by Robin or Robinson.\nWelcome to my personal website and blog.\nWho am I?\nI view myself as a thinker and a teacher. I love to ask big questions about life and the universe and try to find my own answers or relate to books and movies. I constantly have the feeling that there is much to learn, and I’ve only scratched the surface. I am an optimist. I believe in serendipity. Surprisingly blissful things have happened in my life when I least expected them.\nI think life throws similar scenarios at us so that we get a chance to do better next time. Everything - days, months, years, birthdays, anniversaries, festivals - happen in cycles, and we get to relive similar moments as wiser people with time. People that we’re meant to deal with - friends or foes, keep coming in and out of our orbit even when we don’t expect because we still have things to share and learn together.\nI’m grateful for having been surrounded by people and places that brought out the best in me. If you knew me many years back and find me changed with better abilities and more knowledge than before, thank the people I’ve had the chance to be with. I also feel fortunate for being alive at this point in time in the history of mankind. It is arguably the best era so far.\nWhat do I do?\nI’m a Software Professional working in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States.\nI’ve been fortunate to get multiple opportunities to work on mission-critical systems in the past couple of decades which I’ve spent building systems at scale - systems that processed billions of records, web pages that got over 100 million hits per day, APIs that had over a couple of billion calls per day, systems that handled monetary transactions of millions of users and so forth. I’ve worked both as a backend engineer and engineering manager. However, the past decade has been mostly in Engineering Leadership.\nI’m drawn towards projects that are challenging and have tough timelines. I’ve worked on projects that were new ideas and huge re-architecture projects of legacy systems. I love the responsibility that comes with the ownership of a system that is 24/7 and the quick-thinking that is needed to resolve ad-hoc issues that impact customers. I’ve enjoyed working in small, close-knit teams that focused on achieving a large singular goal. I like to streamline things - be it modularizing codebases, or organizing teams to reduce ambiguity.\nMy career has mostly been on e-commerce, payment systems and cybersecurity. I love to learn new things and read books on a variety of topics. I also love to teach and believe that to be my natural talent, with everything else being acquired over the course of my life. I always welcome any opportunity to teach on the side if time permits and hope to do more of it at a later stage.\nHobbies\nOther than software development, I love traveling - mainly to historic landmarks, reading (poetry, classics, sci-fi, technical and semi-technical books). I also love walking long distances and hiking. I’ve run a few half marathons and am looking forward to running a full sometime in the future.\nWriting\nThis website is a collection of my writings on several topics, ranging from books read, places traveled, technologies learnt, and some notes on software. I’ve thought whether I should focus on just one topic - say notes on books read, or on places traveled. Or whether the site should be a professional portfolio. But I’ve decided against those and write the thoughts as-is like I’m talking to a friend. So, all the opinions are like casual conversations.\nAlso, I write everything with the view that it is a draft that I could come back and modify later. I do go back and edit posts when I can. That is one reason for calling the site as ‘Notes’, hoping that with time, it could become PKM system with interconnected links.\nWebsite\nThe current site is a static site generated using Hugo. The site has taken different shapes over the years. The content has been in Blogger, Wordpress, Google Sites, etc. So the site is also an avenue to try some new technology for me.\nIterations\n\nBlogger (2005)\nGoogle Sites (~2008)\nWordpress (2013)\nJekyll with Github pages (2017) - Clean blog theme.\nHugo with Github pages (2020) - Anatole , Aurora, Paperesque, Even, Diary, zzo(Current) themes.\n\nWhy not Blogger, Wordpress, etc. ?\n\nA static site is faster.\nI don’t intend to run ads or do any kind of tracking.\nMany of the platforms may have a fine print that says they own the content.\nEasier to migrate to new themes or platforms.\nI don’t need the bells and whistles of a CMS platform yet.\nEasier to write using markdown.\n\nDisclaimer\nThe thoughts and notes on the site are mine and do not reflect any of my employers or friends."},"Book-Notes/12-Rules-for-Life":{"title":"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan Peterson","links":["Jordan-Peterson"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Philosophy","Psychology"],"content":"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan Peterson\nJordan Peterson is one of those people who does not mince words. When you listen to his talks on YouTube, you always come back a little more pumped up and motivated than before. You also get a feeling that you’ve not been doing enough and need to step up and take more responsibilities.\nI enjoyed reading the book. Every rule is a context where he explains his philosophy and the reasoning behind them. He makes references that are wide-ranging - mythology, Bible, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Viktor Frankl, and so on. I wonder how someone who hasn’t read Bible or Tolstoy could grasp everything in the book. Would definitely like to read it again and write a longer summary and notes.\nSome portions can come across as elaborate explanation to make a simple point. But I found that type of story telling fascinating. His words are stern and advice direct. There are some great quotes.\nThe overarching theme is that ‘the person’ matters. Every person can change, and can effect change. Every person has to make a hero’s journey to succeed. There is no gold without the dragon. Find your dragon and slay it. By making small changes today, you can cause big changes in the future.\nRule 1: Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back\nRule 2: Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible for Helping\nRule 3: Make Friends with People Who Want the Best For You\nRule 4: Compare Yourself to Who You Were Yesterday, Not Who Someone Else is Today\nRule 5: Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything that Makes You Dislike Them\nRule 6: Set Your House in Perfect Order Before You Criticize the World\nRule 7: Pursue What is Meaningful (Not What is Expedient)\nRule 8: Tell the Truth, or at least Don’t Lie\nRule 9: Assume that the Person You Are Listening to Might Know Something You Don’t\nRule 10: Be Precise in Your Speech\nRule 11: Do Not Bother Children when they are Skateboarding\nRule 12: Pet a Cat When You Encounter One on the Street"},"Book-Notes/21-Lessons-for-the-21st-Century":{"title":"21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Sociology","Philosophy"],"content":"I read this book on the way to and during the Alaska Trip that we took during last winter (2019). Read on the flight from SF to Portland and from there to Anchorage. The bulk of the reading was done during the full-day train journey from Anchorage to Fairbanks on the 3rd day of the trip. That was a magical train journey - to go through untouched snow in a vast land seemingly out of nowhere.\nI had listened to ‘Sapiens’ through Hoopla a couple of years back. Probably twice. During my practice runs for the half-marathon that I was running that year and also during the run itself. Audio books are much slower reads than actual reading and I sometimes tend to zone out. Hoping to read the book on print/kindle in the future. But whatever I had heard, it was thought provoking and a well written book. It alters your perspective of the world and you begin to see the entire human history in a different light.\nThe author mentions that Sapiens was about the past of humanity, Home Deus was about the future and this book is about the present. He takes 21 problems, or 21 pressing concerns that the world if facing right now and addresses each of them. It is like reading 21 essays on different topics, well-articulated essays.\nPart I: The Technological Challenge\nChapter 1: Disillusionment\nHumans think in stories than facts. Harari had mentioned in Sapiens that the key reason for ascendency of Homo Sapiens was the story telling ability.\n\nThe fascist story - History is a struggle of nations/races and one tries to subjugate another. Let’s give importance to our nation and our ideals.\nThe communist story - History is a struggle of classes where the upper class always tried to subjugate the lower. Let’s envision a classless society.\nThe liberal story - History is a struggle of liberty and tyranny. Let’s build a world of freedom and equality.\n\n1938 - 3 global stories to choose from, 1968 - 2 stories to choose from (liberal, communist), 1998 - a single story (liberal democracy), 2018 - no story. Disillusionment !\nHarari says that 2008 financial crisis precipitated the disillusionment and gave rise to a lot of pro-national sentiments. With the rise of Trump and Brexit in 2016, people seem to have developed a liking for the old racist and nationalist views. Nostalgia - Britain thinking of old glory, Islamist thinking of how things were 1400 yrs back during Caliphate, Zionists dreaming of going back 2,500 years back, and so forth!\nLoved the paragraph about “Humans vote with their feet”. So true! There are millions of people who wish to immigrate to the US, Germany, Canada or Australia. How many wish to immigrate to China, India or Vietnam? People are willing to undergo extreme hardship to just cross the border and come to the US though there is so much bad press about how immigrants are treated badly, especially the ones from south of the border. How many Islamists from Syria or other countries want to migrate to Kuwait or Saudi vs Germany?\nHarari defines a liberal set menu which outlines what it means at National and International level for Economic, Political and Personal areas. He is optimistic that people will not abandon liberal ideas altogether because of lack of viable alternatives. The dish might contain some items from the menu if not all.\nChapter 2: Work\nThe fear of losing job to a machine has been there since the beginning of Industrial Revolution. But, if you look at the stats, for every job lost to a machine, at least one new job was created. Every job lost to the machine raised the standard of living multi-fold. But future may be different. Work in 2050 might to totally different since AI seeks to not just replace the mechanical work that humans do but cognitive also.\nThere are some tasks that AI is much better than humans. For e.g. driving. Driverless cars could reduce fatality by 90%! degree. Two important non-human abilities that AI possesses are connectivity and updatability. If there are a billion doctors in the world who need to be updated about a new disease, it is almost impossible, but if there were AI-doctors who are networked, it is almost instantaneous.\nIn areas like elder care, music, art, etc., it might take longer for AI to do what humans do.\nIn many fields, there might be more AI cooperation than competition. Also new jobs to debug, service AI will be created. But the key thing about the new jobs that will get created will be that they will require expertise. So retraining might be difficult.\nIn 2017 Google’s AlphaZero defeated Stockfish 8 program in a game of chess. The milestone was critical since AlphaZero learnt chess from scratch in 4 hours! AI is competing with other AI and not with humans anymore!\nThe author does say that rise of AI may not lead to exploitation of humans like it happened during the Industrial Revolution. It might get to a point where everything becomes efficient and people are provided with what they need - food, clothing &amp; shelter. If one gets these things for free, will people go into irrelevance? Wow, one is reminded of ‘The Matrix’ here. AI could actually put all humans to sleep and keep them in a dream state so that they don’t destroy the earth!\nThe author talks about UBI (Universal Basic Income) or Universal Basic Services where social services are subsidized. It could become the utopian vision of communism!\nHe gives example of ultra-orthodox Jews who are poor and unemployed and spend all their time in studying scriptures. They are supported by the government and they are reported to have higher life satisfaction than other groups who have money and are employed!\nThe chapter ends with a positive, powerful note - “The quest for meaning and community might eclipse the quest for a job. If we manage to combine a universal economic safety net with strong communities and meaningful pursuits, losing our jobs to algorithms might actually turn out to be a blessing.”\nChapter 3: Liberty\nDuring the Brexit vote, Ricard Dawkins had said that normal people should not have been asked to vote since most of them are not equipped to know the economic and political consequences of the decision. Elections are about what we feel and not what may be good for us. What people feel are mostly defined by their news feed or search results.\nComputer algorithm might be better equipped to counsel humans than human feelings.\nb×c×d = ahh Biological knowledge multiplied by Computing power multiplied by Data equals Ability to Hack Humans.\nAlgorithm could help you choose a better movie that you might like than you could, decide what to do based on mood, what to buy, which career to choose, etc. Human feelings are shaped by survival and reproduction a million years ago but it is not the case with AI/Algorithms.\nThe author says that knowledge of Philosophy will be in great demand since the algorithms need it to make basic decisions to create more complex ones.\nDigital dictatorship is more dangerous than any dictatorship that we’ve seen in the past. Stalin didn’t possibly know or have control over normal citizens. But AI could know about every single citizen. Big Data algorithms might extinguish liberty and also might simultaneously create the most unequal societies that ever existed.\nChapter 4: Equality\nThe rise of liberalism and increase in globalization in the 1900s promised a more egalitarian society than all the centuries in the past put together. People in India and Egypt could enjoy the same opportunities and privileges as Finland and Canada!\nBut in the 2000s, the trend is changing. Wealth seems to be getting concentrated with the 1%. The richest 100 people own more than the poorest 4 billion people!\nWith the rise of AI and breakthroughs in biotechnology, the divide could get larger and impossible to reduce. Rich people in the past could buy more possessions or live in grandeur. The average rich person was not more intelligent than an average poor person. But now, they could soon have the ability to extend life, have more brain capacity, be more beautiful. The rich might become a set of superhumans who are like gods. This would result in the separation of humankind into a small class of superhumans and a massive underclass of ordinary Homo sapiens. Similar to Greek mythology!\nAs the superhumans evolve to a different species, they might choose to wall themselves off widening the inequality.\nIn the 21st century, data will eclipse land and machinery as the most important asset. The race to control more data is already on with all the big corporations vying for more control. At the moment, ordinary people are more than willing to give away their personal data. In a battle between privacy and health, health is likely to win. But that is fraught with so many dangers even leading to people losing their liberty. But there is no way to ensure private ownership of data at the moment. A technology innovation in that area is very necessary.\nPart II: The Political Challenge\nChapter 5: Community\nIn response to the growing nationalist sentiments after the 2016 elections, in 2017, Mark Zuckerberg published an audacious manifesto on the need to build a global community and that Facebook’s mission was to take this on. Breakdown of human communities was lamentable and Facebook could help people join meaningful communities online. Harari says that “finding meaningful communities and also strengthening our social fabric to bring the world closer together”, is more ambitious than even self-driving car. The goal is timely and noble.\nBut as more and more people live online, they are losing touch of their body, how it feels. People could listen to birds, know if a snake was in the grass by listening to the rustling, but now those skills are going away since people mostly are on their cellphones. People disconnected from their bodies are likely to feel alienated and disoriented. The time and energy you spend in communities online to connect with people across the world will be at the expense of your body, your family and your next door neighbors.\nChapter 6: Civilization\nHarari says that there is only one civilization in the world now. “The West” and the “The Muslim World”, “The East”, etc. may seem different but they are all operating under the same guidelines of modern civilization. Humans in the past were divided into isolated civilizations but not anymore.\nHe gives example of Olympics, it was probably inconceivable to conduct Olympic games at an international level 1000 years back but now it is possible.\nAnother example is medicine. In the past, people in different places were treated differently accordingly to the local belief systems or superstitions. But now, it is mostly identical. People use the same proven scientific approaches and believe in cells and bacteria.\nChapter 7: Nationalism\nNationalism was and is needed for people to support large systems. Harari gives the example of tribes along the Nile river. A tribe or a small group could have easily perished in a famine if multiple tribes hadn’t come together as a nation to help build dam along the Aswan or other infrastructure to feed a large number of people.\nNationalism is actually not in the DNA of a Human. People might prefer to feed their immediate family rather than pay taxes to feed millions of unknown but still they do it. They believe in the propaganda and flag-waving and the feeling of shared history.\nThe problem starts when benign patriotism morphs into chauvinistic ultranationalism. Instead of believing that your nation is unique, if you believe that your nation is supreme and you will be blindly loyal to do whatever it takes to exert its superiority, your thinking is muddled and you’ve declared war. Reminded of Gandhi’s quote - “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.”\nEconomic Challenge - Harari points out that extreme isolationism is completely divorced from economic realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national economies will collapse.\nNuclear Challenge - As more nations have nuclear power, without a robust system of international cooperation, there is no way to protect the world from nuclear destruction.\nEcological Challenge - Without international cooperation of multiple countries, the disastrous effects of global warming cannot be prevented.\nTechnological Challenge - With the rise of biotechnology, if there is no globally accepted ethical guidelines, it could be open season for Dr. Frankenstein.\nThe take away - “In order to take good care of your compatriots, you must cooperate with foreigners. So good nationalists should now be globalists.”\nChapter 8: Religion\nEven in the 21st century, truly secular people are a minority. Billions of people still ardently profess belief in Christianity, Hinduism or Islam. But are they really helping solve the problems of today? In many places, religion is part of the problem of humanity and not the solution, it seeks to divide people and not unite, which is very unfortunate since, of all the ideologies that Homo Sapiens have had over the last millions of years, religion is probably the best unifying force.\n3 types of problems in the 21st century\n\n\nTechnical problems - Agriculture/Medicine - How should farmers deal with severe droughts caused by global warming? If someone is very sick, should he/she be taken to a hospital or a religious place? Religious authority has dwindled in medicine and farming because people don’t associate religion with those anymore.\n\n\nPolicy problems - Economics - For questions like raising taxes, signing tariff agreements, grant authority to AI to make decisions about people’s lives, etc., people/govts turn to Economists and other modern financial theory. Does religion have much to contribute to the great policy debates of our time?\n\n\nIdentity problems - Even in the 21st century, religion gets to define who is ‘us’ vs ‘them’. Many religions use it to divide people. The right approach probably is to adapt religion to new realities to unite people. Harari gives example of Japanese people having reinvented Shintoism.\n\n\nChapter 9: Immigration\nAs he said earlier, “Humans vote with their feet”. World is more connected than ever and immigration is a reality. Harari views immigration as a deal with 3 basic conditions or terms -\n\nThe host country allows the immigrants in.\nIn return, the immigrants must embrace at least the core norms and values of the host country, even if this means giving up their traditional norms. “When in Rome, be Roman”\nIf immigrants assimilate, over time, they become ‘us’ than ‘them’.\n\nThere are always people in both camps. pro-immigration as well as anti-immigration. It is mostly a socio-economic issue. Many countries turn a blind eye to illegal immigration since they want to benefit from cheap labor of young foreigners. But they refuse to legalize the status, thus creating a society of upper class citizens who exploit powerless foreigners.\nImmigration also depends on the cultural make up of a country. Some countries are more tolerant and have mechanisms in place to assimilate them. For e.g. German culture in the twenty-first century is more welcoming of immigrants than Saudi culture. So a Syrian refugee might actually prefer to flee to Germany and not to Saudi.\nHarari illustrates the cultural differences using an example of fictional Coldians and Warmlanders.\n2 points to remember -\n\nIt would be wrong for any government to force large scale immigration on a local population if they are unwilling.\nThough people might oppose immigration, they should realize that they have an obligation towards foreigners.\n\nPart III: Despair and Hope\nChapter 10: Terrorism\nSince 9/11, terrorism has killed around 25,000 people. In contrast, traffic accidents killed 1.25 million people, diabetes killed 3.5 million people and air pollution 7 million people. Terrorists kill few people but instill fear on billions and rattle big governments.\nHarari says that terrorists are like a fly that wants to destroy a china shop. But the fly is weak and has no power to even move a single cup. What does it do? It goes into a bulls ear and starts buzzing. The bull destroys the china shop!\nChapter 11: War\nIn the past, war was the way of the world, the way to get more land and more manpower. But in the present, war is expensive, and countries that have not gone to war have prospered better.\nHuman stupidity is one of the most important forces in history, yet we often tend to discount it. One potential remedy for human stupidity is a dose of humility. National, religious, and cultural tensions are made worse by the grandiose feeling that my nation, my religion, and my culture are the most important in the world. People need to realize their true place in the world.\nChapter 12: Humility\nThe truth is, everyone claims superiority. People are brainwashed from a young age to believe that their group, their religion is the center of the world. The key thing to remember is that the world is large and humans have created hundreds or religions. When we see things in the right perspective, you automatically become humble.\nChapter 13: God\nHarari says that you don’t need to necessarily believe in God to be moral. If you believe in not causing suffering to another human being or reducing the suffering of others, that would suffice.\nWould a human really care about another person’s misery? Most probably yes, people are social animals and their happiness depends to a large extent on the relations with others. So the belief in not causing suffering to another human is at the core of our existence and doesn’t need belief or fear of God to be so.\nReligious belief can create compassion and kindness in people but it can also stoke anger against people who do not follow their belief system.\nChapter 14: Secularism\nSecularism is a positive and active worldview. It is not opposed to religion. In fact, the core of most religion are secularist principles. Secularism views morality and wisdom as the natural legacy of all humans, not something handed down from God to a specific set of humans at a point in time.\nThe Secular Ideals -\n\nCommitment to truth\nCompassion\nCommitment to equality\nCherish Responsibility\n\n”Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.”\nPart IV: Truth\nChapter 15: Ignorance\nIndividual humans are pretty ignorant of their world. We rely mostly on the expertise of others whether we acknowledge it or not.\nMost of people’s views are shaped by communal groupthink rather than individual rationality, and they hold on to these views due to group loyalty. Stating facts to convince someone might actually backfire. True especially for superstitions people.\nHarari talks about how power acts like a blackhole that warps the spacetime around it. Leaders are trapped in it. They have the best knowledge at their disposal but might not be able to leverage it since people might say the right things other than flattery due to the lack of time.\nChapter 16: Justice\nAccording to Harari, there is injustice all around the world and most people live on being ignorant of the part that they are playing. What if the phone that I bought was created by child laborers? What if the company that I invested in and gives me 5% returns is involved in dumping toxic waste that kills sealife? What if the sugar that I’m having for tea results in slave trade across the world?\nThe world is so complex and interdependent that only the ignorant can judge and blame other. One could be abetting a crime just by sitting at home.\nChapter 17: Post-Truth\nWe’re now living in a tragic world of fake news. There is no real way of separating truth from fake news. Propaganda and disinformation is nothing new. It existed in the past - Japanese army created the fake country of Manchukuo to legitimize its conquests, China has long denied that Tibet ever existed as an independent country, British settlement in Australia was justified by the legal doctrine of terra nullius (“no one’s land”), etc.\n”When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month, that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years, that’s a religion” !!\nHarari mentions that it is our responsibility to invest time and effort in uncovering our biases and in verifying our sources of information. Also, if you want reliable information, pay good money for it.\n”If you get your news for free, you might well be the product.”\nChapter 18: Science Fiction\nHarari says that in the 21st century, perhaps the most important genre is science fiction. It gets people excited (or fearful) about the future possibilities and also teaches about fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence more than what people try to read to find out. From that perspective, it is a great responsibility also. Sci-fi authors and movies can distort people’s views and give them bad ideas.\nHarari cites examples from Orwell’s 1984 and Huxley’s Brave New World.\nPart V: Resilience\nChapter 19: Education\nIt is more difficult than ever to predict the future. So we don’t know how things will be in 2050 and cannot really know what we should teach kids to prepare themselves for 2050. The schooling system has foundations in a past world when information was scarce and just knowing to read and write and getting the basics of geography, history and biology was a great improvement. But in today’s world, there is an information overload. So cramming information into kids is probably not the best use of time.\nWhat about teaching technologies that are important today - say coding in C++ or to talk Chinese? But after investing a lot of time in this, we might discover in 2050 that machines/AI can do this better than humans! What should the schools be teaching ? Experts agree on “the four Cs” — Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity.\nThe ability to constantly learn and reinvent yourself would be the key.\nChapter 20: Meaning\nDo we have a fixed ‘true’ identity that determines our duties in life? Is our purpose in life to find this identity and fulfill it? Simba the lion was born to eat antelopes and Arjuna the warrior was born to fight battles and if they don’t they are shunning the natural course of events in a Circle of Life. Are they? Harari goes through a few more worldviews and concludes that all stories are incomplete.\nIn order to give meaning to life, a story needs to satisfy 2 conditions -\n\nIt must give the individual a role to play.\nIt must extend beyond the individuals horizons (as religious stories extends to eternity).\n\nYou cannot leave anything meaningfully tangible behind. So you might be better off just helping someone else.\nHuman quest for meaning all too often ends with a succession of sacrifices - self or others.\n3 basic realities of the universe by The Buddha -\n\nEverything is constantly changing\nNothing has any enduring essence\nNothing is completely satisfying\n\nChapter 21: Meditation\nWas surprised to see Harari mention about Vipassana meditation course. I’d heard about it from AM who has been my colleague since 2011.\nHarari talks about his first experience with meditation and says that he learned more about himself and about humans in general by observing his sensations for those ten days than he had learnt in his whole life up to that point.\nHe meditates for 2 hours every day! Remarkable.\nHe concludes by saying that we have a choice to make an effort and investigate who we really are.\n"},"Book-Notes/American-Dirt":{"title":"American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins","links":["AJ"],"tags":["Fiction","Immigration","Mexico","Drama"],"content":"\n“Lydia knows a little about las colonias of Tijuana because she’s read the books, because Luis Alberto Urrea is one of her favorite writers, and he’s written about the dumps, about kids like Beto who live there.

It is in Brittanica Great Books Volume 5. My newsletter post is [here](www.readgreatbooks.info/p/great-books-ep-71-sophocles-antigone.\nNotes\nPage 1: Lines 1 - 85:\nThe play starts with Antigone talking to her sister Ismene alone. She says no one has had so much ruin, shame, and dishonor like them. She asks if Ismene has heard about the new edict from Creon, their uncle and the king of Thebes. Ismene is unaware of any news after their brothers died fighting each other, and the Argives who supported Polyneices fled. Antigone reveals that Creon has decreed that Eteocles will receive an honorable burial, while Polyneices will be left unwept, untombed, and as a welcome store for the birds to feast on at will. Antigone is outraged by this and resolves to bury Polyneices, saying she’d rather die doing what’s right. She asks for her sister’s help, but Ismene says that they should not defy the law or fight with men. Antigone decides to go forward without Ismene’s help.\n\nIsmene: “Nay, we must remember, first, that we were born women, as who should not strive with men;”\n\nPage 2: Lines 86 - 210:\nAntigone criticizes Ismene’s silence and refusal to help and says she is determined to honor their brother, even if it means her death. Ismene says her errand is foolish but she still loves her. The Chorus welcomes the dawn and recounts how Zeus helped defeat the enemy army, their seven warriors and their boastful leader. Creon enters and says how he has come to power since he is the nearest kin to the dead king and his sons. He says his only goal, with Zeus as his witness, is to ensure the safety and welfare of his citizens. He says that he will always honor those loyal to Thebes and punish its enemies. Since Polyneices sought to destroy Thebes, set fire to the land and enslave people, he will be left unburied as a traitor.\n\nCreon: “No man can be fully known, in soul and spirit and mind, until he hath been seen versed in rule and lawgiving.”\n\nPage 3: Lines 211 - 325:\nAs Creon is talking to the Chorus, a guard approaches and says someone has performed burial rites for Polyneices’ body. He says there is dust covering the corpse, and no one knows who did it. The guards even argued among themselves accusing each other of helping someone with the burial. Creon is upset and angry that someone has defied him and demands that the offender be found.\n\nCreon: “Nothing so evil as money ever grew to be current among men. This lays cities low, this drives men from their homes, this trains and warps honest souls till they set themselves to works of shame;”\n\nPage 4: Lines 325 - 448:\nThe guard exits, and the Chorus sings the praise of humanity - saying humans have tamed everything on earth, learned things on their own, and found solutions to all things except death. The guard returns with Antigone as a prisoner. Creon comes in, and the guard tells him that they saw Antigone performing burial rites for the corpse when the dust storm cleared. Creon asks Antigone if she knew about his edict forbidding the burial. She says yes, it was public, everyone knew.\n\nChorus: “Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man; the power that crosses the white sea, driven by the stormy south-wind, making a path under surges that threaten to engulf him.”\n\nPage 5: Lines 449 - 551:\nAntigone says Creon’s edict doesn’t override divine laws that are eternal. Creon sees Antigone as insolent and stubborn and declares that she should be punished regardless of her being his niece. Ismene arrives, crying. Creon accuses her of being involved in the burial as well. She says yes and wants to share the blame with her sister. Antigone refuses, saying only Hades and the dead were witnesses, and Ismene has no share in it.\n\nAntigone: “For their life is not of today or yesterday, but from all time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.”\n\nPage 6: Lines 552 - 669:\nIsmene again asks her sister how she could help, and Antigone says she alone must bear the consequences of the actions. Creon dismisses both of them as foolish. Ismene reminds Creon that Antigone is betrothed to his son, Haemon and if he would still slay her. Creon says his son can find another wife than Antigone. Haemon enters and says that he looks up to his father’s guidance for everything, including marriage. Creon talks about the importance of obedience to paternal and state authority. He asks him to let Antigone go to find a husband in the house of Hades (death). He plans to slay her for her open disobedience.\n\nChorus: “Blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. For when a house hath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore, passing from life to life of the race;”\n\nPage 7: Lines 669 - 776:\nCreon talks about the importance of obedience and order in society, saying that disobedience is the worst of evils, ruining cities and homes. Haemon tries to reason with his father saying he is wise but should also be flexible and open to other perspectives. He says the citizens of Thebes sympathize with Antigone. He talks about the value of adaptability citing examples of trees bending in a storm and sailors adjusting their sails. But Creon doesn’t see Haemon’s viewpoint and an argument ensues. Creon accuses his son of siding with a woman. Haemon accuses his father of disrespecting the gods. Creon orders Antigone to be brought for execution. Haemon leaves in anger, declaring he won’t see his father again. Instead of executing, Creon decides to entomb Antigone in a cave with minimal food so that the city may avoid public stain.\n\nCreon: “But disobedience is the worst of evils. This it is that ruins cities; this makes homes desolate; by this, the ranks of allies are broken into headlong rout;”\n\nPage 8: Lines 776 - 916:\nThe Chorus describes love as an unconquerable force that affects all beings and says love makes people mad. Antigone mourns her fate as she’s led to her death. She addresses her hometown and its landmarks. She reflects on her family’s tragic history, justifies her actions in burying her brother and looks forward to joining her family in the afterlife. Creon comes in and orders an end to the lamentations, and get started with the entombment.\n\nChorus: “Love, unconquered in the fight, Love, who makest havoc of wealth, who keepest thy vigil on the soft cheek of a maiden; thou roamest over the sea, and among the homes of dwellers in the wilds; no immortal can escape thee, nor any among men whose life is for a day; and he to whom thou hast come is mad.”\n\nPage 9: Lines 916 - 1037:\nAntigone, now sad that she is going to die, wonders if she has truly sinned against the gods. She says it would be wrongful if the gods were to judge against her. The blind prophet Teiresias arrives and tells Creon that he has seen disturbing omens, saying that gods are displeased and no longer accept the city’s prayers or sacrifices. He warns Creon against stubbornness and pride and urges him to allow Polyneices to be buried. Creon gets upset and accuses Teiresias of being corrupt.\n\nChorus: “But dreadful is the mysterious power of fate; there is no deliverance from it by wealth or by war, by fenced city, or dark, sea-beaten ships.”\n\nPage 10: Lines 1037 - 1157:\nSince Creon refuses to listen to his advice, Teiresias warns that he will be punished, that the Furies will bring destruction, that Creon might lose a child, and that other cities will turn against Thebes. The Chorus urges Creon to heed Teiresias’s warnings. Creon finally relents and agrees to free Antigone and bury Polyneices himself. The Chorus prays for deliverance from the current crisis.\n\nCreon: “My heart misgives me, ‘tis best to keep the established laws, even to life’s end.”\n\nPage 11: Lines 1157 - 1267:\nA messenger comes in and announces that Haemon has killed himself. Eurydice, Creon’s wife enters and asks for details. The messenger says when Creon went to bury Polyneices, they heard a wailing from Antigone’s tomb. They rush towards the tomb to find that Antigone has hanged herself and Haemon embracing her body. When Haemon sees his father, he blames him for his fiancé’s death and kills himself. Eurydice, shaken by the news, leaves silently. Creon enters, carrying Haemon’s body, and laments his own actions.\n\nMessenger: “Fortune raises and Fortune humbles the lucky or unlucky from day to day, and no one can prophesy to men concerning those things which are established.”\n\nPage 12: Lines 1268 - 1353:\nCreon mourns his son Haemon’s death, acknowledging his own fault saying he has learned his lesson too late. A messenger arrives and says Eurydice has killed herself after learning of Haemon’s death. Creon is further saddened and blames himself for the loss of both his wife and son. He wishes for his own death. The Chorus emphasizes the importance of wisdom and reverence for the gods.\n\nChorus: “Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness; and reverence towards the gods must be inviolate.”\n"},"Book-Notes/Atomic-Habits":{"title":"Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones By James Clear","links":["ET"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Psychology"],"content":"\n“If you want better results, then forget about setting goals.

With enchanting short real-life stories and fascinating anecdotes, he takes you right into the book, to a different world where you are a student who is observing and studying the behavior of the people in different parts of the world, effortlessly moving to and fro through different periods of time.\nINTRODUCTION - The Statue That Didn’t Look Right\n\nFast and Frugal\nThe Internal Computer\nA Different and Better World\n\nThis chapter tells the story of a kouros that was purchased by Paul Getty museum. The museum authorities had certified it as legitimate after over 2 years of research. But during the opening, some art historians and other experts ‘felt’ that it was fake by just looking at it.\n\nIn the first two seconds of looking — in a single glance — they were able to understand more about the essence of the statue than the team at the Getty was able to understand after fourteen months.\nBlink is a book about those first two seconds.\n\nThe chapter lays a foundation for what the book is about and is a very engaging introduction to keep you from putting the book down.\nONE - The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way\n\nThe Love Lab\nMarriage and Morse Code\nThe Importance of Contempt\nThe Secrets of the Bedroom\nListening to Doctors\nThe Power of the Glance\n\nThe chapter starts with the story of a couple in their twenties - Bill &amp; Susan - who go to the University of Washington to visit the laboratory of a psychologist named John Gottman. They talk about their dog and Gottman videotapes the conversation for 15 minutes. Gottman and team then assign a SPAFF code to every second of the couple’s interaction. [SPAFF code assigns a number to every emotion - Disgust is 1, contempt is 2, anger is 7, defensiveness is 10 .. and so on]. Gottman has proven that he got 95% success of predicting whether a marriage will endure or not by using 1 hour of video and 90% success by 15 minutes.\n\nTo make an accurate prediction about something as serious as the future of a marriage indeed, to make a prediction of any sort — it seems that we would have to gather a lot of information and in as many different contexts as possible.\nBut John Gottman has proven that we don’t have to do that at all.\n\nHe goes further to say that of all the emotions in the SPAFF code, he can find out much about a couple by just focusing on what he calls the “Four Horsemen”: defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Of these 4, contempt is the most important of them all. Criticism is good in a relationship but contempt is very bad.\n\n..presence of contempt in a marriage can even predict such things as how many colds a husband or a wife gets; in other words, having someone you love express contempt toward you is so stressful that it begins to affect the functioning of your immune system.\n\nThen he talks about doctors who get sued vs who don’t and about the research that was done by studying hundreds of recorded conversations between doctors and patients. It is not the doctors with less degrees or qualifications who get sued but mostly the ones that don’t talk much to patients.\nHe also talks about how some people are able to make judgments with just a glance. Brian Grazer knew that Tom Hanks was a star material at the very first meeting !\nTWO - The Locked Door: The Secret Life of Snap Decisions\n\nPrimed for Action\nThe Storytelling Problem\n\nThe chapter starts with the story of Vic Braden, a top tennis coach who could predict when a player would make a double fault. Double faults are rare but he could almost always predict them. But he was unable to explain how he was able to do it. Gladwell goes on to say that snap judgements happen so fast that our conscious mind cannot grasp all the infomration that was used in that instant to arrive at the judgement. When we try to break the process down to explain, we fail to express clearly the thought process that went behind.\nHe then talks about a priming experiment where when a group of students were ‘primed’ by telling them a set of words like “rude”, “bold”, “disturb” ..etc, their behavior was different from another set of students who were primed with different set of pleasant words. Wow! What we listen to matters so much.\nThen he talks about the ‘Speed dating’ experiment done by Iyengar and Fisman from Columbia. When someone said they liked another, the researchers would ask them to explain the reason they cannot. In fact, what the participants said they liked differed from what they actually liked. For e.g, someone said they like people who are intelligent and sincere but they end up choosing someone who is attractive and funny but not particularly sincere or smart at all !\nHe goes on to say that it happens because people are not able to open the locked door - to access the subconscious that made the snap judgement.\nTHREE - The Warren Harding Error: Why We Fall For Tall, Dark, and Handsome Men\n\nThe Dark Side of Thin Slicing\nBlink in Black and White\nTaking Care of the Customer\nSpotting the Sucker\nThink About Dr. King\n\nThis chapter was a bit of a ‘reality check’. Until this point, we are in complete awe of the power of snap judgements, thin slicing ..etc and everything comes crashing down in this chapter. It is like someone saying - “listen to your intuition” and the moment you are prepared to do that, someone says “intuition is bad because we are swayed by our prejudices and what we have been exposed to”. The author then gives a series of word associations with European vs African American and Men vs Women. The exercise was interesting.\nHe then talks about and extra ordinarily successful salesman named\nFOUR - Paul Van Riper’s Big Victory: Creating Structure for Spontaneity\nFIVE - Kenna’s Dilemma: The Right— and Wrong—Way to Ask People What They Want\nSIX - Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading\nCONCLUSION - Listening with Your Eyes: The Lessons of Blink\nAfterword"},"Book-Notes/Cult-of-the-Dead-Cow":{"title":"Cult of the Dead Cow : how the original hacking supergroup might just save the world By Joseph Menn","links":["Book-Notes/This-Is-How-They-Tell-Me-the-World-Ends"],"tags":["Cybersecurity","Non-Fiction","History","Information-Technology"],"content":"There was a lot of talk in the past about PayPal mafia, a group of ex-PayPal folks who after moving on from PayPal went on to found major Tech companies - Tesla, Youtube, Spacex, Palantir, LinkedIn, and so forth.\nI got the feeling that cDc (Cult of the Dead Cow) was something similar for cybersecurity after reading This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends.\nThe book traces the history of the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) from its founding.

Whole Hearts. by Brené Brown","links":["Brené-Brown","books/2020-10-03-dare-to-lead/"],"tags":["Leadership","Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Psychology"],"content":"\n“Daring leadership is ultimately about serving other people, not ourselves. That’s why we choose courage.”\n~ From Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts.1  by Brené Brown\n\nThoughts\nIt feels super inspirational to have finished this book. The book was excellent and it felt good to know that all the people who spoke highly of Brené Brown were justified in doing so. In the last few years, I’d come across Brené Brown’s name many times, through Booklists by leaders I revered2, YouTube feed, Amazon recommendation, etc. In a way, I was primed to read a book by Brené. So, when I chanced upon it recently, I jumped in. It was coincidental that I came across the excellent video on empathy 3 by Brené just when I started reading the book.\nIt feels natural to call the author by first name rather than the full name or the last name. After listening to the audiobook for over 8 hours, you feel like you know the author already. Or it may be due to the anecdotes in the book where she puts conversations where people call her Brené. For instance “BEN: Hey, Brené! Please pull all of the invoices together for me by four o’clock.” (Section 3 - The Armory). Throughout the book, people call her Brené and we also end up doing the same I guess. I generally prefer a book on kindle or printed since that is much faster to finish than an audiobook even at a speed of 1.25. But I’d really recommend the audiobook for this. Brené is an exceptional orator and her voice is so soothing and compelling at the same time that you feel like an esteemed teacher is right there with you, talking in person.\nAnother reason why I felt happy with the book was that it validated a lot of leadership thoughts and ideas that I had. Leadership is about bringing clarity, trusting people who work with you, empowering people, seeking constant feedback, making sure that people feel a sense of belonging, investing time ahead in planning and not pointing fingers when things go wrong, giving honest feedback from a place of vulnerability knowing that the relationship might sour, above all, putting empathy as the cornerstone of all the activities. Business goals that we achieve are for people and done by people.\nThe book has a lot of anecdotes, practical examples, and calls to action that it is useful to situations beyond the workplace. There are so many life-changing quotes in the book to ponder over. I underlined a lot of quotes and felt like I should take a print out and frame some of them. It is one of those books that when you read it and finish, you want to start reading again. I felt the same with 7 Habits (Steven Covey), 12 Rules (Jordan Peterson), Factfulness (Hans Rosling), 21 Lessons (Yuval Harari), Good to Great (Jim Collins), etc. I haven’t read other books by Brené Brown. So I was glad to hear her say that this book contains thoughts from her other books.\nThe main focus of the book is the call to become more courageous, creative, and caring; to grow through vulnerabilities and insecurities; to bring the full person to work, and not a part of the personality. Brené says that achieving workplace goals effectively and efficiently can be done without sacrificing humanity, by being trustworthy, authentic, and empathetic. She also mentions that “Rumbling with Vulnerability” is not about blindly airing your fears to everyone. The right audience needs to be told the right things.\nThere is a companion website called “Dare to Lead Hub” 4 with a lot more ways to get involved in the book with assessments, workbooks, and training. It seems like a movement in itself. Big Ideas from the book are presented in the “The heart of daring leadership” section in the Introduction. The notes below will give you highlights of some aspects of the book, especially the bulleted points mentioned at different places. But, ‘The Map is not the territory’, the summary is not the book. Reading the actual book is a totally different experience and I hope this encourages you to do so.\nNotes\nThe title of Brené’s earlier book Daring Greatly came from a quote by Theodore Roosevelt -\n\n“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again…who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.”\n\nIntroduction: Brave Leaders and Courage Cultures\n\nBrené’s goal is to take her two decades of research and experiences in hundreds of organizations to give us a practical, actionable  book about what it takes to be a daring leader.\nI echo Brené’s sentiment that she wants to live in a world with braver, bolder leaders, and to be able to pass that kind of world on to the next generation.\nDefinition of a Leader : “Anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.”\n\nTen behaviors and cultural issues getting in our way\n\nWe avoid tough conversations including giving honest productive feedback.\nWe spend an unreasonable amount of time managing problematic behaviors.\nDiminishing trust caused by a lack of connection and empathy\nNot enough people are taking smart risks or creating or sharing bold ideas.\nWe get stuck and defined by setbacks, disappointments and failures.\nToo much shame and blame, not enough accountability and learning.\nPeople fear looking wrong, saying something wrong, or being wrong.\nWhen something goes wrong, individuals and teams are rushing to ineffective or unsustainable solutions.\nOrganizational values are gauzy and assessed in terms of aspirations.\nPerfectionism and fear are preventing people from learning and growing\n\nThe heart of daring leadership\n\n\nYou can’t get to courage without rumbling through vulnerability. Courage is a collection of 4 skill sets than can be taught, observed, and measured\na. Rumbling with vulnerability\nb. Living into our values\nc. Braving trust\nd. Learning to rise\n\n\nSelf-awareness and self-love matter; who we are is how we lead.\n\n\nCourage is contagious\n\n\nPart One: Rumbling with Vulnerability\nSection One: The Moment and the Myths\n\nThree Lessons from Roosevelt’s quote mentioned at the beginning -\n\nPhysics of Vulnerability - if you’re brave enough often enough, you will fail.\nDefinition of Vulnerability - “The emotion that we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure”. It is the courage to show up when we don’t know the outcome.\nFeedback needs to be authentic and should come from a place of vulnerability where the person puts himself/herself on the line.\n\n\nRumble Tool - The Square Squad - Get a 1” x 1” piece of paper and write down the names of the people whose opinions of you matter. Take 10 minutes to reach out to those people and express gratitude.\nThe 6 myths vulnerability -\n\nVulnerability is weakness.\nI don’t do vulnerability.\nI can go it alone\nYou can engineer the uncertainty and discomfort out of vulnerability.\nTrust comes before vulnerability.\nVulnerability is disclosure. (Not only is fake vulnerability ineffective, but it breeds distrust.)\n\n\n\nSection Two: The Call to Courage\n\nAn anecdote about a time when her team gave Brené feedback about her time estimation. She remembered that her husband had given similar feedback in the past.\nIt is not a long walk from “I’m not enough” to “I’m better”, but it’s actually just standing still.\nTreasure Hunting - 4 key learnings\n\nNew Meeting minutes process - Someone volunteers as a note-taker and takes down the minutes capturing a)Date b)Meeting intention c)Attendees d)Key decisions e)Tasks and ownership.\nTurn &amp; Learn - People write down their thoughts before anyone speaks up in a meeting. Avoids “Halo effect” (opinions shaped by person with the most influence) and “Bandwagon effect” (see where ‘the wind is blowing’ / agree with the majority).\nGritty faith and Gritty facts - Stockdale paradox from ‘Good to Great’. The people who don’t make it after 8 years in captivity were the Optimists. Always confront the brutal facts of your reality.\nCare and Connection - Apologizing and backing that up with behavior change. “What’s my part” is critical to the success of the rumbling process.\n\n\nDeDe Halfhill’s story - Using the right language to talk about hard things.\nContainer building - Make copies of this story, ask the team to review it, come back after 45 mins to discuss. No time? “If you don’t invest time attending to fears, you’ll have to squander time to manage unproductive behavior”!\nYou cannot take responsibility for other people’s emotions.\n\nSection Three: The Armory\n\nWholeheartedness - “engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough …”\nBringing your whole self to work is crucial to the company and individual success and satisfaction.\nThe table comparing “Armored Leadership” with “Daring Leadership” is perhaps the best part of the book. The side-by-side comparison is found in the workbooks section5 in the Dare to Lead Hub.\nTheir team switched to TASC model from Apple’s DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) model. TASC approach: the Accountability and Success Checklist -\n\nT — Who owns the task?\nA — Do they have the authority to be held accountable?\nS — Do we agree that they are set up for success (time, resources, clarity)?\nC — Do we have a checklist of what needs to happen to accomplish the task?\n\n\n\nSection Four: Shame and Empathy\n\nStory about Brené hitting a glass wall and suffering a concussion at a very busy time, refusing to be treated and impacting everyone around.\nShame 101 - a) We all have it, b) We are all afraid to talk about shame, c) The less we talk about shame, the more control he has over our lives\nHow shame shows up at work - Perfectionism, favoritism, Gossiping, back-channeling, harassment, discrimination, bullying, etc.\nGive people a “way out with dignity”. What gets in the way? a) Armoring up, b) Time &amp; Money, c) The fall guy, d) Lack of vulnerability and courage.\nEmpathy is one of the linchpins of cultures built on trust. Five elements of empathy -\n\nTo see the world as others see it, or perspective taking.\nTo be non-judgmental.\nTo understand another person’s feelings.\nTo communicate your understanding of that person’s feelings.\nMindfulness.\n\n\nSix known barriers to empathy -\n\nSympathy vs. Empathy\nThe Gasp and Awe\nThe Mighty Fall\nThe Block and Tackle\nThe Boots and Shovel\nIf You Think That’s Bad…\n\n\nFour elements of shame resilience -\n\nRecognizing shame and understanding its triggers\nPracticing critical awareness\nReaching out\nSpeaking shame\n\n\n\nSection Five: Curiosity and Grounded Confidence\n\nPool players example - Practice is key.

Most people have read it and on many online forum people say that it is one of the most transformational books they have read. Yet, I hadn’t heard of the book while in India (first couple of decades of my life). I’d read many sci-fi novels, mostly Isaac Asimov and Arthur C Clark, Douglas Adams and HG Wells. Most of the people seem to have read Foundation, Rama series, and H2G2. The sci-fi authors I discovered after coming to the US are - Frank Herbert, Willam Gibson, Dan Simmons, Philip K Dick, Robert Heinlein and Ursula K Le Guin. I’m sure there are more that I’m not recollecting currently. Michael Crichton, James S.A. Corey, etc.\nDune is powerful because it is a lot of things - a coming-of-age story, a story of revenge and family honor, a story of living in a close relationship with nature, a story of heroism, a story of optimism, a love story, a story set in the future (10 thousand years!), a story of prescience and fortune telling, a story of women’s power, a story of politics and strategy, and so forth.

The whole journey took a day since we started around 9-ish in the morning. The book was engaging and awesome. The twist in the end totally took me by surprise. Throughout the book, you feel like Hans Rosling is directly talking to you and then ..\nIt is a positive book. It tells us that the world is in a much better state than we think it is in. In that way it is very similar to Steven Pinker’s “The Better Angels of Our Nature”. Better Angels was the second book that Mark Zuckerberg had read in his 2015 book reading challenge. There are a lot of interesting insights in the book that would enable us to see life and the world in a different light. Instead of dividing the world and developed and developing, he divides it as Level 1, L2, L3 and level 4.

Other sciences have hypotheses that are tested against experimental evidence until they fail, and are overtaken by new hypotheses. In maths, absolute proof is the goal, and once something is proved, it is proved forever, with no room for change.”\n~ Simon Singh, Fermat’s Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World’s Greatest Mathematical Problem1\n\nThe book is part history, part mystery (since we get to know about the proof only in the end), part short biographies of eminent personalities, and also a compendium of key mathematical principles. As Simon Singh says in the book - “The Last Theorem is at the heart of an intriguing saga of courage, skulduggery, cunning, and tragedy, involving all the greatest heroes of mathematics.” Kudos to him for writing such an engaging book.\nAlso, the book references so many other books that just going through the titles is very enriching. It is like going to the favorite section of a library and looking at all the titles that you want to read at some point. At the end of the book, there is a section named “Suggestions for further reading”. Going through the list is like recalling many notable incidents and stories in the book.\nHere are some notes from me on each chapter. The title of each chapter is quite interesting and makes you want to read to find out what is inside.\n1. “I Think I’ll Stop Here”\n\nJune 23, 1993, Cambridge - Andrew Wiles is presenting his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem at the Newton Institute in his hometown of Cambridge.\nThe Last Problem - The book goes into a flashback, to a time when 10-year old Wiles discovered The Last Problem, by E.T. Bell in a library. This sparked his life-long passion to solve Fermat’s last theorem. Then it goes into the origins of this problem, starting with Pythagoras. Many pages are dedicated to Pythagoras and the Pythagoras Brotherhood. It was fascinating to know how extraordinary and influential Pythagoras really was. He probably treated numbers as friends like Ramanujam did. It talks about Perfect numbers (sum of divisors = the number), defective numbers (sum of divisors &lt; the number), excessive numbers (sum of divisors &gt; the number). It was great to know that powers of two - 4, 8, 16, 32 are slightly defective (sum of divisors = the number - 1) and that there are no numbers that are slightly excessive (sum of divisors = the number + 1). Intriguing tidbits.\nEverything is Number - This was a fascinating section where he talks about how numbers and proportions are related to music. Octaves and harmonic notes are all related to simple fractions. And then he says, you look anywhere in the universe, numbers manifest in all kinds of physical processes. For e.g., the ratio of the length of a river to the distance it covers is pi.\nAbsolute Proof - Here, the book compares Mathematical proof and scientific proof. Scientific theories evolve and get better like peeling an onion. But mathematical proofs are infallible and built on a rock-solid foundation that stays strong to eternity. Wow!\nAn infinity of Triples - This gives an account of how Pythagoras dies. In many ways, like romantic heroes of novels, famous Mathematicians seem to die tragic deaths in the hands of jealous adversaries.\nFrom Pythagoras’s Theorem to Fermat’s Last Theorem - Pythagoras equation (x^2 + y^2 = z^2) seems quite innocuous (intuitive even when you consider right-angle triangles). But the moment the powers are changed to cube or higher, you get an equation that is quite complex to prove.\nBooks mentioned\n\nA Mathematician’s Apology - G. H. Hardy\nThe Last Problem - E.T. Bell\nThe City of God - St. Augustine. “God created all things in six days because this number is perfect.”\nIamblichus’ Life of Pythagoras Iamblichus was a fourth-century scholar who wrote nine books about the Pythagorean sect.\n\n\nOther books mentioned in the Appendix\n\nPythagoras – A Short Account of His Life and Philosophy - Leslie Ralph\nPythagoras – A Life - Peter Gorman\nA History of Greek Mathematics, Vols. 1 and 2 - Sir Thomas Heath\nMathematical Magic Show - Martin Gardner\nRiver meandering as a self-organization process - Hans-Henrik Støllum\n\n\n\n2. The Riddler\n\nThis chapter is about Pierre de Fermat, a 17th-century mathematician. He was a civil servant by the day and a Mathematician on the side. Mathematicians were quite secretive during those days with their proofs. Father Mersenne tried to change that and encouraged everyone to exchange ideas. Fermat exchanged ideas with Mersenne but not anyone else till he happened to correspond with Pascal. Fermat and Pascal came up with an entirely new branch of Mathematics - Probability theory! Fermat was also involved in the founding of Calculus.\nA puzzle - Imagine a soccer field with 23 people on it, two teams of 11 players, and the referee. What is the probability that any two of those 23 people share the same birthday? It is a bit over 50%!\nThe Evolution of Number Theory - This section talks about the evolution of Mathematics after Pythagoras’s time. The main person of interest is Euclid. Alexandrian library and the tragic loss of knowledge due to the burning of books are mentioned. Euclid’s Arithmetica survived.\nBirth of a Riddle - Fermat was busy with his judicial duties but used all of his spare time for Mathematics. Claude Bachet (reputedly the most learned man in France) published a Latin translation of Arithmetica, which Fermat happened to read. Fermat wrote logic and comments on the margins of the book.\nThe Marginal Note - In the margin of his Arithmetica (Book 2), next to Problem 8, Fermat wrote an observation about the equation - x^n + y^n = z^n. That there is no number that satisfies this equation and that he had a beautiful proof that the margin could not hold! This statement teased and tormented mathematicians for the next three centuries.\nThe Last Theorem Published at Last - Fermat’s son, Clement-Samuel publishes his father’s work. Leonard Euler, a great mathematician of the time, attempted to give proofs to many of Fermat’s theorems. Euler used the concept of imaginary numbers to prove the theorem for n=3, but could not generalize it.\nBooks mentioned\n\nThe Devil and Simon Flagg by Arthur Porges\nMathematics of Great Amateurs by Julian Coolidge\nThe Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, by Michael Mahoney\nArchimedes’ Revenge, by Paul Hoffman\n\n\n\n3. A Mathematical Disgrace\n\nThe Mathematical Cyclops - This section of the chapter is mostly about Leonard Euler. Was surprised to know that Euler was close friends with the Bernoullis. “Three-body Problem” reminded me of the upcoming Netflix series that the GoT showrunners David Benioff &amp; D.B. Weiss were going to be writing and producing. This section was one of the best. This book is full of geniuses but Euler’s story was truly remarkable. He was completely blind in the last few years of his life but was still working on things.\nA Petty Pace - This section talks about prime numbers and the importance of prime factorization in cryptography.\nMonsieur Le Blanc - This section is about Sophie Germain. Singh talks about various women in the history of Mathematics leading to this point and it was a testament of human triumph in the face of adversities. Interestingly Sophie Germain’s contribution to Mathematics, specifically Fermat’s theorem, may have been attributed to Monsieur Le Blanc (a pseudonym that Sophie used) if Napoleon did not attack Prussia at the time! Sophie wrote a letter to a General friend to guarantee Gauss’s safety.\nThe Sealed Envelopes -  Dirichlet and Legendre independently proved the theorem for n=5, based on Sophie Germain’s work. Lamé proved it for n=7. The French Academy of Sciences offered 3,000 Francs to any mathematician who could solve Fermat’s Last Theorem. Lamé and Cauchy - both great mathematicians of the time, announced that they were on the verge of the proof and submitted sealed envelopes to the academy. Kummer pointed out a fatal flaw regarding using unique factorization.\nBooks mentioned\n\nMen of Mathematics, by E.T. Bell.\nThe periodical cicada problem, by Monte Lloyd and Henry S.

Kummer à M. Liouville by E.E. Kummer.\n\n\n\n4. Into Abstraction\n\nThis section has the story of Paul Wolfskehl, a super rich guy who sets out to commit suicide after a woman rejects him. He is so efficient that he plans everything meticulously, writes his will, letters to family, etc., and even has some spare time before the appointed hour! So lucky for the world!! To keep himself engaged in the spare time, he goes to the library to read something and finds Kummer’s paper. He finds a flaw in the logic and spends the night engrossed in developing a mini-proof, thereby avoiding suicide. Upon his death many years later, he bequeathed a reward of 100,000 Marks (approximately the equivalent of a million dollars by today’s standards) to anyone who could prove Fermat’s last theorem. This prize heralded a new era of interest to solve the theorem and many other mathematical puzzles.\nThe Era of Puzzles, Riddles, and Enigmas - This section goes over the history of puzzles and how they were very popular in the 1800s. Interestingly Lewis Carroll was very interested in puzzles and had set out to write a giant compendium of puzzles. When Wolfskehl prize was announced, there was a lot of frenzy and there was an avalanche of entries sent.\nThe Foundations of Knowledge - This section is about the importance of logic and how Mathematics is strongly built on the foundation of logic. David Hilbert set out to logically rebuild/prove all the mathematical knowledge and make a list of unsolved problems that had to be proved. But Kurt Gödel went on to prove that it was not possible, that from fundamental axioms it is possible to create statements that can never be true or false. “This statement does not have any proof”.\nThe Compulsion of Curiosity - Though Gödel’s theorems of undecidability had put some elements of doubt on whether Fermat’s theorem would ever be proven, it couldn’t dissuade the scores of fanatics.\nThe Brute Force Approach - Invention of computers and the usage of brute force approaches.\nThe Graduate - John Coates, Andrew Wiles’ Ph.D. supervisor encouraged Wiles to study an area of mathematics known as elliptic curves, which proved very useful later on to solve Fermat’s last theorem.\nBooks mentioned\n\n3.1416 and All That, by P.J.

This section gives more details on Taniyama-Shimura conjecture and the importance of bridges that connect separate fields.\nThe Missing Link - Insights from Gerhard Frey &amp; later Ken Ribet, the inference that Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture implied Fermat’s Last Theorem.\nBooks mentioned\n\nYutaka Taniyama and his time, by Goro Shimura.\nLinks between stable elliptic curves and certain diophantine equations, by Gerhard Frey.\n\n\n\n6. The Secret Calculation\n\nThe Attic Recluse - Wiles makes the decision to work in complete isolation and secrecy for many years once he starts working on the proof.\nDueling with Infinity - Wiles had to prove the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture in order to prove Fermat’s last theorem. He employs Mathematical Induction to aid with the proof. This section has the tragic story of Galois.\nToppling the first Domino - Wiles had already spent two years into the proof and using Galois’ Group Theory, he had solved parts of it. He was able to ‘sort’ the infinite number of elliptical equations to groups and prove the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture for the first element of each group.\n”Fermat’s Last Theorem Solved?” - Wiles reads a news article that said the theorem was solved. But thankfully, it turns out to be not the case!\n”The Dark Mansion” - Reminded me of the post made on Amir Aczel’s book 15 years ago!\nThe Method of Kolyvagin and Flach - After a couple of years on Iwasawa theory, Wiles gave up that path and then tried Kolyvagin-Flach method with help from Nick Katz. It was amazing that Katz came on board and grasped 6 years of research in a short time.\nThe Lecture of the Century - Andrew Wiles finally delivered his proof in a series of lectures in 1993. It is one of these lectures that the book starts with.\nThe Aftermath - It became newspaper headlines, including NYT and everyone congratulated Wiles. People magazine even listed him among “the 25 most intriguing people of the year” along with Princess Diana and Oprah Winfrey.\nBooks mentioned\n\nGenius and Biographers: the Fictionalization of Evariste Galois, by T.

A Slight Problem\n\nManuscripts with detailed proof were submitted. Instead of the usual 1-3 referees, 6 were appointed. the 200-page proof was divided into six sections and each of the referees took responsibility for one of these chapters. Nick Katz was one of the referees and he found a flaw.\nThe Carpet Fitter - Initially, Wiles thought it was a minor problem and assured Katz that the solution was right around the corner. But months passed. Word got out and there was a lot of bad publicity. Despite the pressure to release the manuscript publicly, Wiles did not.\nThe Nightmare E-mail - There was an email circulating around that said proof was found in a different way. That turned out to an April fools joke.\nThe Birthday Present - Wiles found a solution just short of his wife’s birthday and handed over the complete manuscript to her as a birthday present.\nBooks mentioned\n\nModular elliptic curves and Fermat’s Last Theorem, by Andrew Wiles.\nRing-theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras, by Richard Taylor and Andrew Wiles.\n\n\n\nEpilogue: Grand Unified Mathematics\n\nOnce again Wiles found himself on the cover of NYT. John Coates was quoted saying - “In mathematical terms, the final proof is the equivalent of splitting the atom or finding the structure of DNA.” On June 27, 1997, Andrew Wiles collected the Wolfskehl Prize.\nBooks mentioned\n\nAn elementary introduction to the Langlands program, by Stephen Gelbart\n\n\n\nAppendixes\n\nAppendix 1.

Over a span of 3 centuries, thousands of brilliant and hardworking men and women were at it.. and in the quest had discovered so many ground-breaking theories ..even new branches of Maths!\nI was just dumbfounded the moment I read it - at the sheer truth behind it. Here it goes ..\n\n&quot;Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. You go into the first room and it&#039;s dark, completely dark. You stumble around, bumping into the furniture. Gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture is. And finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch and turn it on. Suddenly, it&#039;s all illuminated and you can see exactly where you were. Then you enter the next room . . . &quot;\nExactly !! I think this applies to most situations in life! \nI’ve been in this groping-in-the-dark-what-do-I-do-next state so many times !\nMay be that’s the joy of teaching.. you see someone groping in the dark and help him/her to the switch and when the room lightens up .. the look on the bright face..that look is the bliss of teaching. And vice versa.. anyone’d be really happy to be with a person who ‘knows’!\nThere are so many mathematicians mentioned in the book.. Euler.. Gauss .. Galois .. Sophie Germain .. I can see them all..as though they spent their lives on earth just recently. \nWhatever was written about Gauss in the book, I already knew.. even the story of his teacher giving the 7 yr old Gauss with a difficult monotonous problem like 1+2+3+..100 as punishment and him solving it in a couple of minutes ! \nGalois was a revelation .. I was reminded of Marlowe.\nA really bright star who came in, brightened the whole sky with brilliant blinding light , then swiftly disappeared.\nHe was so brilliant that he could solve most equations in his mind. In fact he couldn’t get into the most famous college at that time because he wrote the answers directly without intermediate steps. While still a schoolboy, he’d learnt all the higher level mathematical theories extant at that time and had developed the theory in his name – the Galois theory !\nGalois died in a political duel. The night before the duel.. he was so convinced he would die, that he wrote down his complete mathematical theory and sent it to his friend. At the time of his death, he was just 20!\n\nHeader Image - “Maison Fermat” by Karine C. via Flickr."},"Book-Notes/Flow":{"title":"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience By Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Psychology","Philosophy"],"content":"Key Points\n\nFlow is a state of complete absorption in an activity where time seems to fly and self-consciousness disappears.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHappiness Revisited\n\nIntroduction\nOverview\nThe Roots of Discontent\nThe Shields of Culture\nReclaiming Experience\nPaths of Liberation\n\n\nThe Anatomy of Consciousness\n\nThe Limits of Consciousness\nAttention as Psychic Energy\nEnter the Self\nDisorder in Consciousness: Psychic Entropy\nOrder in Consciousness: Flow\nComplexity and the Growth of the Self\n\n\nEnjoyment and the Quality of Life\n\nPleasure and Enjoyment\nThe Elements of Enjoyment\nThe Autotelic Experience\n\n\nThe Conditions of Flow\n\nFlow Activities\nFlow and Culture\nThe Autotelic Personality\nThe People of Flow\n\n\nThe Body in Flow\n\nHigher, Faster, Stronger\nThe Joys of Movement\nSex as Flow\nThe Ultimate Control: Yoga and the Martial Arts\nFlow through the Senses: The Joys of Seeing\nThe Flow of Music\nThe Joys of Tasting\n\n\nThe Flow of Thought\n\nThe Mother of Science\nThe Rules of the Games of the Mind\nThe Play of Words\nBefriending Clio\nThe Delights of Science\nLoving Wisdom\nAmateurs and Professionals\nThe Challenge of Lifelong Learning\n\n\nWork as Flow\n\nAutotelic Workers\nAutotelic Jobs\nThe Paradox of Work\nThe Waste of Free Time\n\n\nEnjoying Solitude and Other People\n\nThe Conflict between Being Alone and Being with Others\nThe Pain of Loneliness\nTaming Solitude\nFlow and the Family\nEnjoying Friends\nThe Wider Community\n\n\nCheating Chaos\n\nTragedies Transformed\nCoping with Stress\nThe Power of Dissipative Structures\nThe Autotelic Self: A Summary\n\n\nThe Making of Meaning\n\nWhat Meaning Means\nCultivating Purpose\nForging Resolve\nRecovering Harmony\nThe Unification of Meaning in Life Themes\n\n\n"},"Book-Notes/Foundation":{"title":"Foundation by Isaac Asimov","links":[],"tags":["Fiction","Classics","Sci-fi","Futuristic"],"content":"\n“Any fool can tell a crisis when it arrives.

At the end of the book, one gets the feeling that you’re just beginning on an epic journey. What we see are small glimpses of what happened. Like an old man telling a story from his youth, or like reading random stories from an epic anthology. Every story starts with a passage from “Encyclopedia Galactica”, a hypothetical compendium of knowledge. The first story sets the backdrop of the beginning of the Foundation (or foundations). The second takes place 50 years after the first, the third is 30 years after that, the fourth (The Traders) is 55 years after that and so on.\nThe vast world\nWhat is surprising is that the book was published in 1951, 70 years prior to now! In fact, the individual stories in the book were published in the preceding decade. The immense world-building and the numbers are so mind-boggling that it is not easy for one to wrap one’s mind around it. The Galactic Empire has reigned for 12,000 years. Humans have populated millions of planets. The total population of humanity is in quintillions. Trantor the planet which is the capital of the Galactic Empire, has a population of 40 billion. In 1951 40B might have been such a huge number for a planet since the population of Earth back then, was around 2.5B. Now earth has over 8B people and 40B is only 5 times as big. If we have mile-long cities below the surface, it would not be that crowded as we think it would be. Though Factfulness does mention that the population most probably will plateau once it reaches around 11-12B. We’ll have to see what the future holds. My hope is that the population keeps increasing and that humans will be able to inhabit other planets. It is more optimistic to visualize a 12,000 year Galactic Era in the future than a desolate earth destroyed by human fighting. Also, ten thousand years into the future, one could hope that human lifespan could be much more than the mere hundred years of the present.\nThe Beginning\nHari Seldon, a psychohistorian, is in Trantor at the beginning of the novel (the first short story). Hari is predicting that the empire will fall in the next 300 years to enter into a dark age for 30,000 years. Hari has a plan to reduce the time to just 1000 years. He is captured for espousing traitorous ideas of the fall of the Empire and brought to trial. During his trial, he maintains that the fall of the Empire is inevitable and says that it is necessary for a group of people to be assembled to consolidate all the knowledge into an encyclopedia, creating what he calls as ‘The Foundation’. As a punishment, the committee exiles him to a planet named Terminus in the corner of the galaxy. It is later revealed that Terminus is the exact planet that Hari wanted to create the Foundation in. We also get to know that there is another foundation being created at the other end of the galaxy.\nHari is able to predict what happens in the future based on his calculations. Long after Hari is dead and gone, a recorded voice of his plays exactly 50 years after Foundation is established. The book mentions a few times that the laws of statistics applied to large groups of people could predict the general outcome of future events. One of the characters asks whether it could predict a single person’s life to which the answer is that No, one cannot foresee a single person’s future using psychohistory. The inspiration probably came from Bernoulli’s Theorem (the law of large numbers) which says that outcome of an experiment will converge to the expected value when it is performed a large number of times (or using a large sample). So if a coin is flipped multiple times, the result will converge to 1/2 as the number of tries approaches infinity.\nReflections\nIn the third chapter, it was interesting to see The Foundation exercising control over the four planets (four kingdoms) nearby through religion (named Scientism). The Foundation itself is set up on Terminus, a planet with scarce resources but it has scholars and superior technology. The Foundation shares its technology with the four Kingdoms by referring to it as “holy” artifacts and rules. Scientism has priests who are trained on Terminus but they are unaware of the true nature of the technology that they are using. I was reminded of an article that I’d read in the past where someone had listed many of the superstitions followed in India and the scientific basis behind them. Peepal trees being associated with ghosts and sleeping under them is not good, one must take bath after attending a funeral, don’t cut nails after sunset, etc.\nIn the last story, Hober Mallow, a master trader, realizes the limitation of religion to conquer more territories (planets/kingdoms). The way to expand more is through trade. So when the Republic of Korell declares war on The Foundation, Mallow takes no action but imposes a ‘sanction’ on Korell stopping trade. This forces Korell to surrender without The Foundation having to go on a war. That is so similar to the way some countries today maintain control over other aggressive nations!\nWinning things through diplomacy and scientific knowledge is a huge theme throughout the book. In fact, the statement “Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.” is repeated often, especially in the last story.\nQuotes\n\n”It is the chief characteristic of the religion of science that it works.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Past glories are poor feeding.”\n\n\nIt’s a worship of the past. It’s a deterioration—a stagnation!\n\n\n”Encyclopedias don’t win wars.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;The rotten tree-trunk, until the very moment when the storm-blast breaks it in two, has all the appearance of might it ever had.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Religion is the most potent device known with which to control men and worlds.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Ambitious men will not wait and unscrupulous men will not hang back. By their every action they will hasten the decay of the worlds.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.”\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nFoundation (Apple Series Tie-in Edition) by Isaac Asimov ↩\n\n\n"},"Book-Notes/Functional-Thinking":{"title":"Functional Thinking: Paradigm Over Syntax by Neal Ford","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Programming","Software-Development"],"content":"For someone who has been doing Java programming and reading through lot of OO codebase for over a decade, functional programming is truly a paradigm shift. It is not like learning a different language or different version of Java from Java 2 (1.2) to Java 8. The first time I was exposed to functional programming is probably around 2012 when I had to do a project for an ML course using R language. It was refreshing to do things differently for sure. Thanks to RV, I learnt the basics of Clojure last year. I’m at a stage where I can read Clojure code and understand and may be write very simple programs but not beyond that. Anyway, the paradigm shift that Ford talks about can be summarized in the example that he gives in the first chapter of the book.\n\nLet’s say for a moment that you are a lumberjack. You have the best axe in the forest, which makes you the most productive lumberjack in the camp. Then one day someone shows up and extols the virtues of a new tree-cutting paradigm, the chainsaw. The sales guy is persuasive, so you buy a chainsaw, but you don’t know how it works. Demonstrating your expertise with the previous tree-cutting paradigm, you swing it vigorously at a tree—without cranking it. You quickly conclude that this newfangled chainsaw is a fad, and you return to your axe. Then, someone appears and shows you how to crank the chainsaw.\n\nThe best thing about the book is that he gives a lot of code examples. So one needs to just think of how to solve these examples and get the gist of what is being talked about.\nChapter 1 : Why\n\n”OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code under‐ standable by minimizing moving parts.” ~ Michael Feathers\n\nThis chapter provides a broad overview and shows some examples of the mental shift that the author is teaching us.\n\nExample 1-1. Word frequencies in Java\nExample 1-2. Word frequencies in Java 8\nExample 1-3. indexOfAny() from Apache Commons StringUtils\n\nThe IndexofAny() method accepts a String and an array and returns the index of the first occurrence in the String of any of the characters in the array\n\n\nExample 1-4. indexOfAny() example cases\nExample 1-5.

This method accepts a String and an array and returns the index of the first occurrence in the String of any of the characters in the array.\n\nChapter 2 : Shift\n\n”Once garbage collection became mainstream, it simultaneously eliminated entire categories of hard-to-debug problems and allowed the runtime to manage a process that is complex and error-prone for developers. Functional programming aims to do the same thing for the algorithms you write, allowing you to work at a higher level of abstraction while freeing the runtime to perform sophisticated optimizations.&quot;&quot;\n\n\nExample 2-1. Typical company process (in Java)\n\nLet’s say that you are given a list of names, some of which consist of a single character, and you are asked to return a comma-delimited string with the single letter names removed, with each name capitalized.\n\n\nExample 2-2.

I paid my dues in languages like C++ for too many years, and I don’t want to surrender the conveniences of modern languages. That’s the story of how software development progresses.”\n\nIt’s so great to see this comment in the book! I spent close to a year in 2007 and over a year in 2015-2016 to re-engineer C++ applications into Java. Though the projects were for different companies (ebay and paypal), co-incidentally, both applications were related to payments!\nIn this chapter, the author shows five ways developers in functional languages can cede control to the language or runtime, freeing themselves to work on more relevant problems.\n\nIteration to Higher-Order Functions\nClosures\nCurrying and Partial Application\n\nCurrying describes the conversion of a multiargument function into a chain of single-argument functions.\nPartial application describes the conversion of a multiargument function into one that accepts fewer arguments, with values for the elided arguments supplied in advance.\n\n\nRecursion\nStreams and Work Reordering\n\n\nExample 3-1.

I’ve read it so many times over the years, each time taking something away more than before.\nNow I’m reading it after The Return of the Native and can’t help but compare the approaches of Hardy and Dickens. Both give us a glimpse of a period of time and a set of people that we become intimate with by reading. Through great dialogues, monologues, many times in the dialect of the locals, the readers get to know the emotional state of the protagonists at every juncture of their lives.\nIn this novel, we feel like Pip is narrating as he is living his life and not as a person who is recounting events from his past. The fear he feels with the convict, when he is harassed by the guests, when soldiers come to the door and he thinks they have come for him, his feelings for Estella, his feeling of hopelessness of being a blacksmith, and so on, everything is so well captured, that it is unbelievable.\nThough there is an element of fate interfering withe lives of people in both the novels, I think fate is much more harsher in Hardy’s novel than in Dickens. I think the overarching narrative is that people ‘reap what they sow’ and usually get into difficult situations or fortunate ones depending on many of the decisions they make. Matthew Pocket, Herbert, Joe, Biddy are good throughout and they get rewarded in the end. Compeyson, Orlick, Pumblechook, Drummle, are not and they get punished. But, when I think of ‘The Return of the Native’, I think the narrative is that people don’t have a choice. They are just playthings in fate’s hands. Things will play out the way it needs to regardless of what people plan.\n\nNotes\nStage I\nChapter I - Pip meets the convict\nThe novel starts with Pip, a boy standing near the graves of his parents and his dead brothers trying to imagine what they looked like. We get to know that he had named himself and Pip in his childhood and his actual name is Philip Pirip. He is brought up ‘by hand’ by his sister and brother in law. Brother in law, Joe Gargery, is a blacksmith.\nPip is interrupted by a large, dirty man with prison irons attached to his leg. He demands to know Pip’s name, turns him upside down to empty his pockets, He tells Pip to bring him some food and a file after he gets to know that his uncle is a blacksmith. He tells him that there is a young man with him who will tear is heart and liver out if he doesn’t oblige. Pip runs home frightened.\nChapter II - Pip steals food for the convict\nPip returns to his home. His sister, who is 20 years senior to him, scolds him and asks him where he has been. She reminds him that she brought him up by hand and that he is a burden to her. Her husband, Joe is a mild-mannered person. Mrs. Joe gives Pip and Joe bread and butter fo supper. Pip hides his in his trousers. Joe is surprised that Pip bolted the bread and Mrs. Joe is upset that he swallowed the whole thing. She gives him tar-water as punishment.\nThey discuss about the escaped convicts when they hear gunshots. They live near the coast, near the marshland, where ships that form as jails are docked.\nNext morning is Christmas day. Pip is not able to sleep in the night and early in the morning, he gets up, takes some more food from the pantry, some brandy and runs off to the marshes in search of the convict.\nChapter III - Pip gives food to the convict\nOn his way, he sees man that he thinks is the convict, touches him and gets startled to know that the person is not the person as before. He thinks this is the young man the other man was talking about. The person runs away. Pip walks a bit more and finds the original convict and gives him food and the file. When Pip tells him about the other convict, this man is totally surprised. He gets to file away at the irons on his leg and ignores Pip. Pip slips away and runs towards home.\nChapter IV - Christmas Dinner\nPip rushes home thinking that his theft might have been found out. But is relieved to know that everyone is busy in dinner preparations for Christmas. They have some guests - Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle), Mr. Wopsle (church clerk who has a voice better than the priest) and Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. During dinner Mrs. Joe and Uncle Pumblechook focus on Pip and tell him that he has to be grateful towards his sister. Joe tries to console Pip by pouring some gravy into his plate. Mr. Pumblechook drinks the brandy from the bottle and spits it out discovering that it was tar-water. Pip is frightened thinking that his stealth will get discovered. He is about to run out of the home, opens the door and sees cops outside.\nChapter V - Pip and Joe joins soldiers to search for convicts\nPip is relieved when the soldiers say that they need the services of a blacksmith. So they did not arrive to catch him! The soldiers need help to repair handcuffs. Joe helps with it after that, when they set out to find the fugitives, Joe, Mr. Wopsle and pip join them. After a long search they find them. The two men are found fighting each other in a ditch. The convict tells the soldiers that he was capturing the other convict to bring him to the prison. The soldiers capture both men and take them to the station. Pip wonders if the convict would think that he led the soldiers to them. The convict tells the soldiers that he had stolen some food and file from the blacksmith’s home, thus clearing Pip’s name. Joe says it is ok.\nChapter VI - Pip and Joe get back home\nPip and Joe get back and tell the folks what happened. Everyone wonders how the thief broke in and have multiple theories including him entering through the chimney. Pip does’t tell anyone, not even Joe.\nChapter VII - Pip gets the opportunity to offer services a rich lady\nPip is not old enough to be apprenticed to Joe. So, he attends a school run by Mr. Wopsle’s great aunt. Mr. Wopsle is a tenant of one of the rooms in the building. The building also has a little general shop. The grand-aunt is helped by Biddy who is her grand-daughter. Pip comes home and tries to teach Joe what he has learnt. Joe is super impressed. When asked why Joe didn’t go to school, he talks about his childhood when his dad was a drunkard who beat up him and his mother. Since his mother was abused, he is very careful to note that he would never abuse his wife and is ok to take abuse from her.\nMrs. Joe makes occasional trips with Mr. Pumblechook on market days to assist him to buy household items since he was a bachelor and didn’t trust his servants. One of the days she returns with Mr. Pumblechook to inform Joe and Pip that a rich old lady, Ms. Havisham has asked for a boy and Mr. Pumblechook was gracious enough to suggest Pip. She is very happy and grateful to Mr. Pumblechook for the opportunity. Gets Pip cleaned up for the visit and leaves that night.\nChapter VIII - Pip visits Satis House\nPip stays with Mr. Pumblechook that night and is taken to Ms. Havisham’s mansion the next day. Pumblechook reminds him to be grateful for the opportunity to go into this great house. Though the house is big, it seems very old and not maintained. A gruff young lady greets them, lets only Pip in. While walking she mentions that the name of the house is Manor House or Satis House. She leaves him in a room which doesn’t have outside light coming in but has candles. Pip sees Ms. Havisham dressed in bridal clothes. They look grand but are old and yellow. She asks him to play and he is confused. She then asks him to call Estella. He calls her and they play cards. Estella beats him at the game and insults him for his looks and clothes throughout. He almost cries in front of Estella on the way back but holds back his tears. Pip is so embarrassed by himself that he kicks against a wall on the way back. He realizes that he is a low-life.\nChapter IX - Pip describes events at Satis house\nPip returns home to find everyone very curious to know what happened. Mr. Pumblechook says that he has never seen Ms. Havisham but has had interactions with the house many times on business. Pip is uncomfortable since he is still sad about him being low in the social strata. He invents a story about Ms. Havisham sitting on a black velvet coach, Estella handing her cake and wine on a gold plate, and four large dogs fighting for veal cutlets from a silver basket. They are totally astonished.\nLater Pip tells Joe the truth and he admonishes Pip to not tell lies.\nChapter X - Pip gets money from the convict from the past\nCouple of days later Pip wakes up thinking - best step he could take towards making himself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew. So he goes over and learns from Biddy who is willing to help him with all that she knows.\nOne day, his sister tells Pip to get Joe from a public house named Three Jolly Bargemen on his way back from school, since he goes there in the evenings to smoke. Pip goes there and a man offers them a drink. Joe refuses but the man insists. Pip notices that the man is stirring his drink with the file that Pip had stolen in the past. He gets a fright thinking that his secret would be out. The man gives Pip a shilling wrapped in paper which turns out to be pound notes. Joe goes back thinking it was a mistake but are not able to find the man. Pip has a nightmare about the file in his sleep.\nChapter XI - Pip goes to Ms. Havisham’s again\nIn the last meeting, Ms Havisham had told him to come after 6 days. The day comes and Pip makes a visit to the Manor House. Estella lets him in and takes him to a room where he sees some other people - 3 ladies and a man. A lady named Camilla, who reminded Pip of his sister, a man named Cousin Raymond, another lady named Sarah Pocket, another lady named Georgiana. They look at him and comment about him. He is then taken to another room where there is a wedding cake that is rotten and has insects crawling about them. Ms. Havisham holds Pip’s hand and goes around in the room. She says that when she dies, her body will be on the table with all the people watching.\nPip plays cards with Estella with Ms. Havisham watching. Estella continues to insult him. On his way back, a thin boy approaches him and challenges him for a fight. Pip knocks him down but he always gets up to fight. Finally he gives up. Estella who is waiting at the gate doesn’t ask him why he is late. She grants him a kiss. He kisses her but still feels like a downtrodden person.\nChapter XII - Pip’s appointment at Ms. Havisham’s becomes daily\nNext time when he goes over to the Manor House, Pip is half expecting to be punished or scolded for beating up the thin boy. But he doesn’t find the boy anywhere nor is there any mention of him. He goes in and continues the regular thing of walking with Ms. Havisham in the room and playing with Estella. Sometimes the walk goes on for 3 hours. Ms. Havisham gets to know more about Pip, that he is set to be apprenticed to Joe when he grows older, etc. Pip is expected to go daily and that continues for many months.\nOne day, Ms. Havisham says Pip is old enough to be apprenticed and asks him to call Joe to the Manor House. He gets home and tells the news to Joe and Mrs. Joe. His sister is angry that she wasn’t invited and takes it out on Joe and Pip. She asks Joe why he didn’t marry a slave.\nChapter XIII - Pip’s apprenticeship to Joe is formalized\nThe next day, Pip, Joe and his sister go over to the town. His sister goes to Mr. Pumblechook’s place and Pip and Joe head over to Satis House. Estella opens the gate as usual, doesn’t take any notice of them and leads them to Ms. Havisham’s room. Ms. Havisham asks a few questions to them. Joe answers questions to Pip instead of to Ms. Havisham even for questions directed at him. It embarrasses Pip. Towards the end, Ms. Havisham gives a generous amount of 25 guineas and tells him to give it to his master, Joe.\nThey get back and tell Mrs. Joe and Mr. Pumblechook and they are very surprised at the amount given. As he goes back home, Pip realizes that the job that he once looked forward to, is not exciting anymore. He does not want to be a blacksmith.\nChapter XIV - Pip feels bad about being just a blacksmith\nPip says that it is a miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. He once felt distinguished and happy merely at the thought of becoming Joe’s apprentice but not anymore. As he thinks back, he reminds himself of all the great qualities of Joe. The reason he did not run away or feel out of place, was not because he was virtuous, or faithful, it was because Joe was virtuous, Joe was faithful beyond measure.\nPip is haunted by the fear that Estella would come one day and see him with a black face and hands, dirtied by the job and consider him lower than she already thought and truly despise him.\nChapter XV - Mrs. Joe is attacked\nPip continues to work for Joe. Since he has grown, his education at Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s school is done. Biddy continues to teach him what she knows, Pip tries to learn things from Mr. Wopsle also. He tries to teach Joe what he knows it is not of much use.\nOne day, he asks Joe for half-day off to go to town and see Estella. Joe advises him against it telling him that Ms. Havisham might think that he has gone there to ask for something. Pip is insistent and Joe grants him his wish. Orlick, another chap who works with Joe also asks for half-day telling him that he should treat all employees equally. Joe relents. Mrs. Joe hears this and is totally furious. She asks Joe if he thinks he is so rich that he can afford to waste wages. Quarrel ensues between her and Orlick. Joe beats him up for talking bad to his wife.\nSunday comes and Pip goes to Satis House. Estella doesn’t open the gate, it is Sarah Pocket. Ms. Havisham tells him that Estella has gone away abroad to be educated to become a lady and is prettier than ever, hoping to taunt him.\nPip is in no mood to go home. But goes over slowly. On the way he hears some commotion, someone says there is something wrong at his place. He reaches home to find that someone has broken in and knocked down Mrs. Joe with a very hard blow on her head.\nChapter XVI - Mrs. Joe is paralyzed, Biddy comes to stay to take care of her\nThey discover that the blow was made with the leg-iron that the convict had filed away long back. Mrs. Joe is completely bedridden and Joe and Pip take care of her with difficulty. Mrs. Joe cannot talk and does not know to write.\nLucky for them, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt passes away and Biddy comes to stay with them. She nurses Mrs. Joe and takes care of others.\nMrs. Joe often used to write the symbol of T which Joe or Pip never understood. Biddy surmises that it could mean a hammer. They realize that Mrs. Joe means to say Orlick. They bring in Orlick thinking that she will denounce him as the person who hit her but she is friendly with him and he comes by often after that.\nChapter XVII - Pip confides in Biddy of his desire to become a gentleman\nPip goes to Satis Manor on his birthday to visit Ms. Havisham. She gives him a guinea and tells him to come next yr during his birthday. Pip becomes conscious of Biddy changing into a neat young lady, though not as beautiful as Estella. He asks Biddy how she manages to take care of the house and also catch up with him on all the reading and learning. She reminds him jokingly that she is his first teacher. Pip has heartfelt conversations with Biddy on how he feels. He tells her that he wishes he could be happy as a blacksmith and be with Joe and her but he is not, he wants to be a gentleman. When he tells her than it is on account of a young lady at Ms. Havisham’s, Biddy asks if he wants to be a gentleman to spite her or to win her. She gives the sage advice that both reasons are not good enough and that the lady is not worth winning over. Pip tells her frankly that it would have been easier if he was in love with her than with Estella. Biddy doesn’t mind it and is thankful for his confidence. On the way back home, they meet Orlick and both hate to be with him. She says he has eyes on her and that’s why she doesn’t like him, but it shouldn’t be of Pip’s concern. They get home. Pip’s dissatisfaction with life keep growing and he says that the confusion is fifty thousand fold and is scattering his wits.\nThis is probably the most poignant part of the story yet. One feels sad for Pip, sad for Biddy, and sad for being in a place of unhappiness.\n\n”Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?” Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\n\n\n”I don’t know,” I moodily answered.\n\n\n”Because if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”\n\nChapter XVIII - An anonymous patron bestows wealth on Pip\nIt is the fourth year of his apprenticeship with Joe and on one Saturday evening, while they were in Three Jolly Bargemen, a lawyer presents himself and asks for Pip. Pip and Joe go with him to Joe’s home, and Mr. Jaggers, the lawyer tells them that an anonymous patron wants to gift a property to Pip and fund his training to become a gentleman. At the beginning, Mr. Jaggers asks Joe if he wants money or some form of compensation for relieving Pip from his apprenticeship. Joe says no. Mr. Jaggers tells them that Pip will live in London and he can take training from anyone. Since he doesn’t know anyone, Jaggers suggests Mr. Mathew Pocket whom he has heard of. Pip quickly makes the connection to Ms. Havisham since he had heard the name there. Jaggers gives him money to buy clothes. Joe is dumbfounded. Jaggers again asks if Joe needs any money for the loss of Pip’s services and he says no. When Jaggers insists, Joe gets upset. Jaggers leaves. Pip decides that he will buy clothes but not wear them from the village, lest everyone see. He will wear them from Pumblechook’s home and go to London. Pip tells Biddy and she is happy with the news. Though Joe and Biddy are cheerful, Pip is gloomy at the prospect of leaving. But he is also looking forward to leaving.\nChapter XIX - Pip prepares to leave his village\nPip prepares to leave to town to shop for clothes. He mentions to Joe that if he could read or ‘get on a little more’ with the lessons, he could have come with him to London. Joe mentions that he is awfully dull and it is better for him here. Pip mentions the same to Biddy and she tells him that Joe might actually like it here in the village than in London. Pip thinks it is because of her jealousy. Biddy says he can think what he wants to. Pip goes over to the town. Pumblechook is totally a changed man to him now. He ingratiates himself to Pip by giving him the best food, shaking his hands many times and praises him often. Pip gets his new clothes and dresses himself up in those and goes over to Satis House.

While eating, he also teaches Pip upper class manners whenever a chance comes. He gives Pip the name of Handel, after a famous composer.\nThis quote about Pip’s impression of Herbert, caught my eye -\n\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich.\n\nI stopped reading the book and thought about myself at that moment!\nMs. Havisham’s Story - Ms. Havisham’s father was a country gentleman and also a brewer. After her mother died when she was young, her father denied her nothing and in his doting, he made her a spoit child.

While they were talking Herbert comes in and is excited to see Joe and talks to him well. Joe tells them that he is in town to see Mr. Wopsle act in a play. Wopsle had left church and now was a full time actor.\nAfter Herbert is gone, Joe tells Pip that he is actually here as a messenger. Ms. Havisham had asked to see him and that Estella was in town.

He does a lot of thinking about what to do. Should he stay at Joe’s place? Should he take the Avenger? What if Trabb’s boy tells Avenger unsavory things about his childhood? etc. He decides to stay at the Blue Boar Inn and not to take the Avenger.\nPip finds that in the coach that he takes, two convicts are also being transported. He recognizes one person as the one who gave him two one pound notes. Pip tries his best to avoid the convicts and being recognized.\nThe convicts don’t have a place in the back so they are put in the front much to the dismay of other passengers.\nPip overhears the convicts talking and one of them says that another person had asked him to give two one pound notes to a boy who had fed him and kept his secret.

He goes on to say that the other man got charged for escaping prison and got a life sentence.\nPip gets even more alarmed after hearing the conversation thinking that he convict might recognize him soon. So as soon as the town comes, he gets down and walks the rest of the way. At the Inn, the waiter recognizes him and asks if he should send for Mr. Pumblechook.

He tells her that Mr. Pocket and family are well.\nThere is a young lady by Ms. Havisham’s side whom Pip doesn’t recognize. But when she lifts her eyes, he recognizes that it is Estella.

In the next day’s post, he also writes a letter to Mr. Trabb saying that he will not do business with him due to the boy’s conduct.\nPip confesses to Herbert about his love for Estella which Herbert had already guessed. Herbert also mentions to him that since Mr. Jaggers never mentioned Estella, marrying her may not be a condition or wish from his benefactor who he thinks is probably Ms. Havisham.

The book has a ton of facts and well researched material that he weaves into the story as a master folktale teller unraveling secrets one by one. There is so much packed into the book, it is mind boggling. The same was the case with Sapiens2. Also with 21 lessons3. This book provides a worldview by taking oneself totally out of it and looking at it as an objective observer, of the past and the future, something Harari asserts that only Homo Sapiens can do. It has a progressive outlook towards the endless possibilities of a brighter future but also has an ominous overtone.\nTLDR;\nThe book starts off by saying that humanity has all but solved the problems that killed people en masse in the past - disease, famine, and violence. The new agenda of the future would be to raise the stakes much higher and aim for - happiness, immortality, and divinity. Well, it is not too far away, the transformation of humans into gods is within reach. It is exciting as well as scary to think of the unimaginable world that humans are entering into.\nProvocative Statements\nThe strength of the book is in the way Harari constructs words to convey meaning. Some of them are so intense that they give you a jolt. There are many unbelievably provocative yet deeply true statements.\nTake for instance something that he says when he describes human relationship with animals in the past.\n“We are suddenly showing unprecedented interest in the fate of so-called lower life forms, perhaps because we are about to become one.”\nOops!!\nHarari says that throughout our history, most humans never gave much consideration about other animals. They were there to serve mankind, as food or labor. Many religions went to great lengths to assert the dominance of humans over other creatures justifying mindless killing for sacrifice or sport. The realization that Artificial Intelligence or Superhumans of the future might treat normal humans as lower life forms, was profound!\nAnother instance is when he compares the Theory of Relativity which is tough to understand vs the Theory of Evolution which is much easier to grasp.\n“The Theory of Relativity makes nobody angry because it doesn’t contradict any of our cherished beliefs”. But the Theory of Evolution makes a lot of people angry because it contradicts the long cherished belief of existence of soul and all the creation myths. The concept of soul and all the theology around it in different religions is so difficult to understand but people defend it with their lives in opposition to Evolution.\nOr consider this statement -\n“People who believe in the hi-tech Ark should not be put in charge of the global ecology, for the same reason that people who believe in a heavenly afterlife should not be given nuclear weapons.” Wow!\nWas reminded of this scene in Westworld Season 2 finale (The Passenger). The hosts see an open gateway at the edge of a cliff and they run to it. The moment they jump in, their consciousness is uploaded into a virtual world and they are very happy but in reality, they are jumping off the cliff edge to their demise! People who have their lives locked into a strong belief in afterlife could blow up everyone and there could just be a void after that! Of course, suicide bombers are scary, but scarier are the people who believe that whatever ecological catastrophe happens, they have an ark or an underground bunker or a colony in Mars to escape into!\nNew Religion\nWhat Harari says about Dataism as the new religion is something that we can identify with. We’re seeing it all around. Everything is just a huge data processing system.\nI was taken aback by his theory around consciousness though. Is it just mental pollution? Here is a quote from the book -\n\n“Consciousness is the biologically useless by-product of certain brain processes. Jet engines roar loudly, but the noise doesn’t propel the aeroplane forward. Humans don’t need carbon dioxide, but each and every breath fills the air with more of the stuff. Similarly, consciousness may be a kind of mental pollution produced by the firing of complex neural networks. It doesn’t do anything. It is just there.”\n\nI don’t quite agree. But it is something to think about for sure.\nOverall, it is an engaging read. You might agree or disagree with a lot of points in the book but it does make you look at things from a different point of view and force an internal dialogue.\nAfterthoughts\nThe title of this post references a famous quote from Robert Browning -\n\n“Ah, a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?”\nfrom Andrea del Sarto 4 By Robert Browning.\n\nThe quote implies that we should try to achieve things beyond what we can hold on to, but we might not be able to reach heaven. I think the book points to the the possibility that in future, humans might go beyond what even the wildest notions of heaven that we have currently.\nThough I agree with many points in the book, I can’t agree with everything. Though Harari is a great scholar, some things seem to be subjective opinions.\nRather than believing that the world is an empty void of eternity, I’d like to believe that we catapult ourselves towards being spacefaring beings that can travel anywhere in this vast Universe, like in the TV series The Expanse5. I’d like to believe that we’d find out more about telepathy, astral projection and other non-understood phenomena, like when Murph discovers that the Ghost in the bookshelf that she was interacting with, was Cooper from future (sorry for the spoiler alert from Interstellar6).\nAs an aside, while we’re talking about Interstellar, here is a thrilling scene from the movie.\n{{&lt; youtube a3lcGnMhvsA &gt;}}\nSeeing the scene or just listening to the soundtrack or live performance is simply inspiring. Napoleon famously said “The word impossible is not in my dictionary”, but Cooper’s “No, It’s necessary” in answer to CASE’s “It’s not possible” could go down as one of the greatest dialogues in movie history.\nNotes\nListing down the TOC and the headings of different sections to jog the memory for myself or anyone who wants to recollect the concepts in the book.\nIntroduction\n1 The New Human Agenda\n\nThe Biological Poverty Line\nInvisible Armadas\nBreaking the Law of the Jungle\nThe Last Days of Death\nThe Right to Happiness\nThe Gods of Planet Earth\nCan Someone Please Hit the Breaks?\nThe Paradox of Knowledge\nA Brief History of Lawns\nA Gun in Act I\n\nPART I Homo Sapiens Conquers the World\nQuestions - What is the difference between humans and all other animals?

Or perhaps more aptly put, each of us may hold a piece to a puzzle no one else has been able to solve since humankind first landed on Hyperion.”\n~ Sol Weintraub in Hyperion1\n\nShort Summary\nHyperion, the novel, starts in the future (2900 AD) at a time when humans have become inter-planetary species, and the worlds are connected via the WorldWeb. People are able to not only talk but also travel across planets almost instantaneously. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly developed and has its own civilization named the “AllThing,” and they assist humans. The worlds are governed by the “Hegemony of Man”, a coalition of representatives from humans (Senate) and AllThing. In addition to this, there is a group of humans called Ousters who broke away from the rest of humanity since they disapproved of the dependence on AI.\nThe novel’s setting is a war between the Outsters and the Hegemony to gain control of a planet named Hyperion. What makes Hyperion unique is that it contains structures that move back in time called the “Time Tombs”. They are guarded by a mysterious four-armed creature named “The Shrike”, with a body full of curved steel blades. The creature is a legend since most people have no idea how it looks or if it even exists. People take a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs and The Shrike temple, never to return.\nFor the first time, the Time Tombs are opening, and there may never be a pilgrimage again. Seven people are selected to take the final pilgrimage to the Time Tombs, and what they find might decide the fate of the galaxy. They don’t know each other, nor how they were chosen, but they have some connection with the Shrike.\nEach of the seven pilgrims tells their stories to understand what connects them and how their past is helpful to the future of humanity. The book ends with stories from all of them except one (since that person goes missing), and they embark on their journey into the valley of the time tombs. So the end is actually the beginning! I liked the ending.\nIt kind of reminded me of “Raised by Wolves”2 Season 1, where a flying snake is born at the end of the season, and that sets the stage for the real beginning. Or even in “Game of Thrones”3 Season 1, after an entire season of eventful happenings, at the very end, the dragons are born, signaling that the story is just about to start.\nOf course, I read part 2 of the book - “The Fall of Hyperion”4 to get to know what happens to the pilgrims.\nin medias res5\nI love stories that start in the midst of things, and the past is revealed slowly as the story progresses. If you think of it, once you’re an adult, most people you meet always have some fascinating history that you get to know slowly as you get to know them in the present.\nThinking of flashbacks, the first thing that comes to mind is “The Arrow”6 TV series. I saw the first couple of seasons of the show a few years ago, and the way the show presented the two parallel timelines was incredible. It was like watching two movies in parallel.\nIn fact, there are many stories that start in the middle, and that’s what makes them intriguing. There are so many, but a few come to mind right now. ‘The Odyssey’7 doesn’t immediately begin after the Trojan War but many years later. We get to know of the events prior to the start of the book (Ulysses being held captive by the goddess Calypso) at a later point. ‘Paradise Lost’8 begins after Satan, and his followers are defeated. The backstory of the reason and the war are told as the story progresses. Coming back to TV series’, GOT3 is a good example. It starts 15 years after the rebellion, which dethroned the Targaryens, who had ruled Westeros for 300 years. As the series progresses, we get to know a lot of the backstory and mythology about Westeros. ‘The Blacklist’9 is an example of a story where the backstory has so many twists and turns!\nList of stories\nAs I mentioned earlier, the book is effectively a collection of short stories by the pilgrims - Catholic priest Father Lenar Hoyt, Colonel Fedmahn Kassad, poet Martin Silenus, scholar Sol Weintraub, detective Brawne Lamia and the Hegemony Consul. The Templar Het Masteen does not tell his story since he goes missing. Father Hoyt starts with another priest’s (Paul Duré) account. So in a way, Father Hoyt says two stories - his and Duré’s. So there are actually seven stories. If you strictly count the number of pilgrims, it is not seven but eight. Sol has a baby with him.\n\nThe Priest’s Tale: “The Man Who Cried God” - Told during dinnertime when the pilgrims are on the treeship Yggdrasil on their way to Hyperion.\nThe Soldier’s Tale: “The War Lovers” - Told after they land on Keats and start their journey upriver on a ship named Benares.\nThe Poet’s Tale: “Hyperion Cantos” - Told on the ship during dinner time while traveling further north to the Shrike temple.\nThe Scholar’s Tale: “The River Lethe’s Taste is Bitter” - Told on the windwagon that would take them across the sea of grass.\nThe Detective’s Tale: “The Long Good-Bye” - Told on the tramcar between the mountains.\nThe Consul’s Tale: “Remembering Siri” - Told after they reach Chronos Keep.\n\nThe first story gives you a jolt and makes you think, especially about resurrection. Sol’s story is sad and helps explain the presence of the baby. Brawne’s story reminded me of Snowcrash10. The story that I liked best was Martin the poet’s tale. There were so many quotable passages that I re-read a few of them.\nThough the genre is sci-fi and the backdrop is war, the presence of John Keats11 looms large. There are references to Keats everywhere. The capital city of Hyperion is named Keats. Several of the poems get mentioned throughout the story. Searched for Keat’s poems and found the list of 10 Greatest Poems by John Keats by Annabelle Fuller quite good. In the comments section someone mentioned an article about Keats’ Great Odes and the Sublime and that set me thinking about the Submlime in Westworld.\nIn Westworld12, The Sublime, is a virtual world, a heaven, for the hosts. They can upload their consciousness into the Sublime and leave their robot bodies behind. Watching the hosts gleefully jump into the sublime through the door in the ‘Valley Beyond’ was one of the iconic scenes in Westworld.\nBack to Silenus, here are a few quotes from his tale.\nQuotes from the poet’s tale\n”There arises from a bad and unapt formation of words a wonderful obstruction to the mind.&quot;\n&quot;My early poetry was execrable. As with most bad poets, I was unaware of this fact, secure in my arrogance that the very act of creating gave some worth to the worthless abortions I was spawning.&quot;\n&quot;Belief in one’s identity as a poet or writer prior to the acid test of publication is as naive and harmless as the youthful belief in one’s immortality … and the inevitable disillusionment is just as painful.&quot;\n&quot;The life of a poet lies not merely in the finite language-dance of expression but in the nearly infinite combinations of perception and memory combined with the sensitivity to what is perceived and remembered.&quot;\n&quot;Reworked experience is the stuff of all true poetry and raw experience was the birthing gift of my new life.&quot;\n&quot;Besides, history viewed from the inside is always a dark, digestive mess, far different from the easily recognizable cow viewed from afar by historians.&quot;\n&quot;Prison always has been a good place for writers, killing, as it does, the twin demons of mobility and diversion.&quot;\n&quot;As long as the task is both onerous and repetitive, I discovered, the mind is not only free to wander to more imaginative climes, it actually flees to higher planes.&quot;\n&quot;Words bend our thinking to infinite paths of self-delusion, and the fact that we spend most of our mental lives in brain mansions built of words means that we lack the objectivity necessary to see the terrible distortion of reality which language brings.&quot;\n&quot;Language serves not only to express thought but to make possible thoughts which could not exist without it.”\n“Poets are the mad midwives to reality. They see not what is, nor what can be, but what must become.&quot;\n&quot;Words are the only bullets in truth’s bandolier. And poets are the snipers.&quot;\n&quot;Poetry is only secondarily about words. Primarily, it is about truth.&quot;\n&quot;The difference between finding the right word as opposed to accepting the almost right word was the difference between being struck by lightning and merely watching a lightning display.&quot;\n&quot;Sometimes took an hour or a day for a word to come to me, for a concept to sink its roots into the firm soil of language.&quot;\n&quot;For those who do not write and who never have been stirred by the creative urge, talk of muses seems a figure of speech, a quaint conceit, but for those of us who live by the Word, our muses are as real and necessary as the soft clay of language which they help to sculpt. When one is writing—really writing—it is as if one is given a fatline to the gods. No true poet has been able to explain the exhilaration one feels when the mind becomes an instrument as surely as does the pen or thought processor, ordering and expressing the revelations flowing in from somewhere else.”\nFootnotes\n\n\nSimmons, D. (1990). Hyperion. New York: Bantam Books. www.google.com/books/edition/Hyperion/u4R_FstZDEgC ↩\n\n\nRaised by Wolves, Season 1, Ep 10: The Beginning. raised-by-wolves.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beginning ↩\n\n\nGame of Thrones, Season 1, Ep 10: Fire and Blood. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_Blood_(Game_of_Thrones) ↩ ↩2\n\n\nSimmons, D. (1995). The Fall of Hyperion. New York: Bantam. www.google.com/books/edition/_/e-ZOSWjeWroC ↩\n\n\nwww.britannica.com/art/in-medias-res-literature ↩\n\n\nArrow - Season 1. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(season_1) ↩\n\n\nThe Odyssey (Emily Wilson Edition). (2018). United Kingdom: W.W.

It is dark , the wind is heavy , the campfire is blazing furiously ..yet Makar , smoking his huge pipe , was unfazed. It was as though these heavy conditions never affected him.(reminds me of Vikram-Betal stories of chandamama ! it was dark , the night was heavy , yet Vikram was unfazed. He climbed the tree , pulled the corpse out . as he started walking away with it , the corpse on his shoulder came to life !!!) .\nMakar is of the opinion that people are born to travel; that there is nothing better than traveling. “A curious lot people are ; they herd together trampling on each other when there is so much of space-” . he asks why a man should be ploughing a field . “A man who ploughs land pours his strength into the land. He not only loses his strength but also his freedom. He is tied to the soil. I have traveled so much , seen so much and learnt so much that you would require a 1000 bags of paper to put them all in.”\nWait , wait ! what’s happening ? is this the story of an old gypsy and his philosophy ? dear pal , it certainly is not. who , in reality is he in the story ? No one. He is less significant that the phone operator in my office who connects me to some important person outside whom I wish to speak to . The story belongs to the fearless youth Loiko Zobar or does it belong to the beautiful but vicious Radda ? Let us pace towards them.\nThe talk stops when they hear Nonka , Makar’s daughter singing. The author looks at her and is fascinated by her beauty. Makar says “you would like to have a beautiful maid like her to fall in love with you . wouldn’t you ? No good for you. Put no faith in women. Once you kiss one , all your freedom is gone. You will come to ruins. Let me tell you a story -”\nLoiko Zobar was a fearless youth who was famous across the whole of steppes. If he ever took fancy to something , it was his . He traveled hither and tither as he pleased. There were at least 10 men in each village who had sworn to take his head. But they couldn’t even touch a hair on his head. It was said that he could even knife the devil if he came in his way.\n“His moustaches swept down his shoulders , where they mingled with his hair; his eyes shone like two bright stars, and his smile was sun itself. ..When he looked into your eyes, your soul surrendered to him, and instead of being ashamed of this, you were proud of it. You seemed to always become better in his presence.”\n(Though I see Richard Grenvile in every brave man whom I read of , if I were to write about Richard , the description would match the one above – word to word.)\nRadda was the queen among beauties. A man could not but be rooted to the place where he stood if he saw her. “No words could ever describe Radda’s beauty. Perhaps it could be played on a violin , but only by one who knew the instrument as he knew his soul.”\nMany many men asked for her hand but she refused. A rich man was so dumbstruck with her beauty that he was ready to give away everything for her sake. But she was too haughty. To the rich man her reply was “if the eagle’s mate went into the nest of a crow of her own will, what would you think of her ? ”. Likewise she mocked at everyone who asked her hand.\nIn one of his travels , Zobar chanced to come to the camp that Radda was in.\n….\nAt once smitten by Radda’s beauty he tries to woo her. But she finds his talk humourless, finds his music bland, she doesn’t in anyway relent to him. Zobar plunges into deep despair and is seen playing his fiddle throughout the night. He is so brilliant with the fiddle, that his music melts everyone’s heart.\n“You felt that tune with every fibre of your body, and you became a slave of it. And if at that moment Zobar had called out ‘out with your knives, comrades’, every man would have bared his knife against anyone he pointed out. He could wind a person with his little finger, but everyone loved him dearly”. Such was Zobar’s effect on all. Yet Radda would have nothing at all of it. She mocked him continuously. While all others appreciated every song that he sang, she vehemently criticised them.\nNot finding a way to make her approve of him directly, Zobar approaches Danilo, Radda’s father. Danilo approves; says “Take her if you can” . Radda is seen sitting on a horse and Zobar approaches her. He says he has seen many a woman but none as fiery and beautiful as her. He asks her to be his wife but warns her that being his wife doesn’t mean that she would be able to curb his freedom. In reply she lashes her whip at him. The whip catches his feet and pulls him down. He falls on the ground on the back of his head. Radda has a wild grin on her face.\nAs he limps away Radda dismounts from the horse and comes towards him. As soon as she is near him, Zobar goes for his knife, Radda pulls her pistol out. She tells him that she is ready for truce, that she finds him the bravest man in the whole of steppe, the only one who could ever stand up to her. She presents a proposition before him . If she has to be his wife he has to touch her feet in front of every one around and then kiss her hand. She tells him that her passionate kisses and caresses are just waiting for him. Under their effect he will forget the brave life he led in the past and be a servant of her for ever.\nEveryone finds it distasteful that Zobar has to touch her feet. Zobar says nothing, he goes away. He is seen thinking the whole night, sometimes playing sad tones with his fiddle in the night .\nThe next day comes . Zobar tells his comrades that he will touch her feet but he needed to test how strong her heart was. Zobar walks towards Radda , goes close to her and plunges his knife into her heart. She pulls the knife out and moments before life went out of her she said “Farewell Zobar. I knew you would do it”. As the stunned crowd sees a lifeless Radda fall down, Zobar throws himself on her feet. Moments later everyone is still silent as Zobar gets up and starts to walk away. It was then that Danilo Rushes towards Zobar and thrusts his knife to the back of his heart. Zobar falls.\nThe image of Radda and Zobar lying dead keeps circling in the author’s mind, but Makar continues smoking his huge cigar.\n\nHeader Image - “The steppe” by Alan Fieldus via Flickr"},"Book-Notes/Measure-What-Matters":{"title":"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs by John Doerr","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Management","Leadership","Business"],"content":"\nThis is the definitive book on OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), the de-facto goal-setting system in many Silicon Valley companies (my opinion based on my experience).\nWhat are OKRs?

But those few hours can truly set you thinking for several days. The book starts off like a comedy and you keep expecting the protagonist to wake up from his dream or for him to transform but you reach the end of the story and it is quite difficult to come to terms with the tragedy of it all.\nThe Story\nGregor Samsa is a traveling salesman with a hectic schedule and is the sole earner for his family. He doesn’t like his job nor his micromanaging boss but he cannot quit since he needs to take care of his family. He is an exemplary worker who has not called in sick in his five years of service and yet he is afraid of being fired on the spot by his boss.\nHe wakes up one day and finds that he has changed into a giant bug (or cockroach). His biggest concern is that he will not be able to catch the train and go to work and that his boss will misunderstand that he is slacking.  And that turns out to be the case. When Gregor is delayed, the Head Clerk comes to his home and asks him to come out assuming that he is hiding in his room after having done something wrong.\nWith great difficulty he manages to roll over and get out of bed and open the door. Everyone is shocked, the Head Clerk runs away. From that day onwards everything goes awry. His family slips into poverty, his father starts working as an assistant, his sister starts working as a salesgirl, they get some boarders home for rent, etc. Though initially sympathetic to his plight, gradually it gets to a state where they blame him for all their misfortunes. They think that they will be ruined unless he is dead. In the end, Gregor dies heartbroken and the family is relieved.\nReflection\nI was reminded of the story of the leper2 in the Bible. Over the years, I’ve heard a lot of sermons on this story which is usually given on the second Sunday of the lent. The story is the same but the interpretation and the message is always different. But it could also be that the same message is perceived and understood differently.\nLeprosy or any kind of skin disease was deemed to be a curse. After contracting leprosy, some people would go away from their families and stay with other lepers outside the city gates. Some people would be driven out by their family. In some cases, family would take care of the lepers but the society would ostracize the family and sometimes force them to send the leper way. Regardless of the way people treated them when the disease started, they almost always ended up being alienated and outsiders to the society.\nThe fear of alienation and the pressure of the society is real. Many times, people give more than what is needed for a job, sacrifice their sense of self for a relationship or to be part of a group - just not to be alienated. Then they lose their ‘self’ completely and become a bug only to get into the situation that they feared the most - being alienated. I guess the key is to ‘give it all’ and “do more” only for something that is “your true calling” and not when you don’t like it every day. But the unfortunate thing is also that most of the people in the world do not have that choice. The technological advances of the 21st century have not solved world hunger and disease yet. Improving the quality of life seems quite far off.\nAnother thing was family’s view of life when misfortune hits them. When you have a misfortune and you compare yourself against others, you begin to believe that only you are riddled with problems and everyone else has an easy life.\n\n”The main thing holding the family back from a change in living quarters was far more their complete hopelessness and the idea that they had been struck by a misfortune like no one else in their entire circle of relatives and acquaintances.”\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe Metamorphosis (AmazonClassics Edition) free for Prime members. ↩\n\n\nStory of the Leper - Matthew 8:1-4, Mark 1:40–45 and Luke 5:12–16 ↩\n\n\n"},"Book-Notes/My-Cousin-Rachel":{"title":"My Cousin Rachel by Daphne du Maurier","links":[],"tags":["Fiction","Romance","Historical"],"content":"{{&lt; img src=“/images/img/general/blog6_cornwall.jpg” width=“100%”&gt;}}\n\n6/17\nIt was Krishna’s wedding. Krishna, my closest pal during childhood; my first best friend (first best friend !! does that sound strange ? well ! at different times in life I had different best friends. Guys with whom I had nothing to hide and who hid nothing from me. My brothers.) All day I was wondering what to give. He generally was fond of things carved out of glass. The only doubt was whether he still liked showpieces . well, I thought I’d go to the shop and decide. Brigades was on the way. I decided to put at stop at Archies there to choose a gift. As always there was no place to park. Went downwards alng Church Street looking for a space. Drove, drove and drove .. finally found a place to park. Turned around to see something that I would always love to see. Blossoms. Something was going on. Was it being renovated ? No, this was the newly furnished ground floor and was still being filled with books. I went to the first floor – straight to the du Maurier section. Eyes sought ‘My cousin Rachel’ . There it was – a greenish book with a lady draped in a green shawl looking directly at me. Behind her was a house, a villa. The villa was a bit far off. Between the villa and her one could see a lot of greenery. Trees all around and a well maintained lawn.\nI turned the book and started with what was written on the back cover (I hate reading whatever is written in the back cover. I feel it somehow gives away the author, somehow cheats me, somehow doesn’t give me the right to let the events unwind in my mind since I start expecting things to happen. My best readings have come from books of which I hadn’t read an introduction, of which I knew nothing, expected nothing. I don’t know how many of you like to see movie trailers or would enjoy the movie after you have been told the story.) Anyway, the crime was committed. I read it in a single go ..\n“Ambrose married Rachel and never returned home. His letters to his cousin hinted that he was being poisoned and when Philip arrived in Italy, Ambrose was dead…”\nI’ll put a stop to Gorky and start with du Maurier.\n..\n6/20\nIt’s a flashback. Philip’s flashback. It’s about him recounting the events that haunt him. Philip ? Philip in ‘The Mill on the floss’ had a hunchback, Philip in ‘Of Human Bondage’ had a clubfoot, what disadvantage does this Philip have ? None? He is orphaned, yes, but none with his physique, something with the psyche though.\nWhen the narrative starts with Tom Jenkyn’s hanging that he had witnessed in his childhood, you wonder why he is telling about it and as you go further, you tend to dismiss it as some bad happening that he had witnessed as a kid.\nHaving lost his parents at a very young age he was brought up by Ambrose, his cousin. Ambrose was everything to Philip, He was Philip’s father, mother, guardian, teacher, role model – all in one. Ambrose is unmarried, is very passionate about garden, always trying to gather some rare shrub to plant.\nThe story starts with a middle aged Ambrose not being able to withstand winters in England. He is advised to go to a hotter place and this time Ambrose decides to go to Italy. From Italy he writes to Philip often. In one of his letters he mentions about meeting a distant cousin of theirs, cousin Rachel. In the next few letters he is all words about Rachel, describing her interest in gardening and trees. The letter after that comes with the news of him being married to Rachel. This is a shock to Philip and he feels as though someone has taken Ambrose away from him. But he conveys the news to his neighbours who are really happy upon hearing the news. The letters from Ambrose stop coming. After a long time, Philip gets a very short letter from Ambrose, in illegible handwriting , hinting that his wife is trying to kill him. Philip gets alarmed, speaks to his godfather Nick Kendal, who says Ambrose might not be well and that he might have tumour in the head that his father had.\nPhilip sets out to Italy.\n..\n6/21\nOn the way he gets a mail from Ambrose asking him to leave to Italy immediately. With great difficulty he get to Florence and when he reaches the Sangaletti villa, he is informed that Ambrose is dead. Philip is almost devastated and inconsolable. He could not even imagine that he would never see Ambrose again. He comes to know that Rachel has left the place taking away all of Ambrose’s possessions except for a hat. Philip takes the hat and sets out to meet Rachel’s friend Rainaldi. Rainaldi is a matter-of-fact businesslike person and Philip takes an immediate dislike for him.\nPhilip sets back to England. After a few months, he is called by his godfather Nick who tells him about a mail from Rachel. Rachel was planning to come to visit them.\n\nHeader Image - “Cornwall England” by barnyz via Flickr"},"Book-Notes/Navigating-the-Cybersecurity-Career-Path":{"title":"Navigating the Cybersecurity Career Path by Helen Patton","links":["Book-Notes/This-Is-How-They-Tell-Me-the-World-Ends"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Information-Technology","Cybersecurity","Career-Development"],"content":"I follow Helen Patton on LinkedIn.

It is in Brittanica Great Books Volume 5. My newsletter post is here.\nNotes\nPage 1 ( Lines 1-71):\n\nThe play begins with An elderly Oedipus and his daughter Antigone arriving at a sacred grove and Oedipus wondering where they are.\nAntigone looks around and says that they are near Athens. As she is describing the place, a stranger arrives and and tells them that they’re on sacred ground that shouldn’t be trodden upon.\nThe place is dedicated to Eumenides, the daughters of Earth and Darkness. (From reading Aeschylus’ Eumenides, we know that they are the Furies, the goddesses of vengeance.) He also mentions that the area is sacred to Poseidon and Prometheus.\nThe stranger says that the king of the place and surrounding is Theseus. Oedipus asks to see Theseus.\n\nPage 2 (Lines 72 - 193):\n\n\nThe stranger leaves, and Oedipus prays to the gods asking for their grace since he believes that he found the prophesied final resting place.\n\n\nA group of elders (chorus) enters and asks Oedipus to move away from the sacred place and sit in a corner. Then they ask him about his origins.\n\n\nPage 3 (Lines 194 - 305):\n\n\nAfter Oedipus tells his story, they are alarmed and want this cursed person to leave their land as soon as possible.\n\n\nAntigone appeals to the Chorus for compassion, emphasizing that her father’s crimes were unintentional.\n\n\nOedipus also says that his crimes were fated and not done by him, and he questions the value of Athens’ reputation for hospitality if they reject him.\n\n\nPage 4 (Lines 305 - 409):\n\n\nIsmene (Oedipus’ second daughter) arrives and Oedipus and Antigone are overjoyed to see her.\n\n\nIsmene tells them about the conflict between Oedipus’ sons, Eteocles and Polyneices. She says Eteocles has seized the throne, expelling Polyneices.\n\n\nShe says that an Oracle has told Creon that if Oedipus is in Thebes (regardless of alive or dead), they will have victory. The people of Thebes want Oedipus near their land but not within their borders since they think he is cursed.\n\n\nPage 5 (Lines 410 - 512):\n\n\nOedipus is upset and angry that people are going to be seeking him to get the throne and not because they care for him.\n\n\nLooks like after Oedipus had exiled himself after his mother/wife’s death and his blindness, he wanted to go back and at that time, the city exiled him and his sons did not help. Oedipus declares that he will never help Thebes or his sons.\n\n\nThe Chorus suggests that Oedipus make atonement to Eumenides and give instructions on the ritual. Since he is blind, Isemene performs the ritual and leaves.\n\n\nPage 6 (Lines 513 - 603):\n\n\nOedipus goes into detail about his past as the chorus is eager to know more.\n\n\nTheseus, the king of Athens, arrives. He is sympathetic to Oedipus and offers him support and protection.\n\n\nOedipus thanks him and says that the city will benefit even after he is dead. He says that his sons had refused him when he was willing to return and now will come to seek his help to get the throne.\n\n\nPage 7 (Lines 604 - 722):\n\n\nOedipus prophesies that Athens will benefit from him being buried there. Theseus accepts Oedipus as a citizen of Athens and offers him the option of staying where he is or come to his home.\n\n\nOedipus decides to stay at the grove. Theseus leaves and the chorus sings praises of Colonus and Athens.\n\n\nPage 8 (Lines 723 - 828):\n\n\nCreon arrives and appeals to Oedipus to return to Thebes, citing kinship and pity. Oedipus rejects him outright.\n\n\nThey exchange sharp words. Creon says they have already taken Isemene and orders his guards to seize Antigone. Oedipus is shocked. The chorus demands Creon to leave.\n\n\nPage 9 (Lines 829 - 919):\n\n\nAs Antigone is dragged away, Creon threatens to take Oedipus also captive.\n\n\nTheseus arrives and immediately takes action, sending men to rescue the daughters. He criticizes Creon for disrespecting Athens and its laws.\n\n\nPage 10 (Lines 920 - 1040):\n\n\nCreon says he didn’t think that Athens was providing refuge to Oedipus. He says Oedipus is cursed by the gods and no one would give him refuge.\n\n\nOedipus says that everything in his life was fated by the gods and his crimes committed in ignorance. But Creon’s crimes are not so.\n\n\nTheseus stands by his word to protect Oedipus and orders Creon to return the maidens.\n\n\nPage 11 (Lines 1040 - 1163):\n\n\nTheseus leaves with Creon and returns with Antigone and Ismene.\n\n\nOedipus is overjoyed to see his daughters back and thanks Theseus and praises him.\n\n\nDuring this time, they are informed of a new suppliant at Poseidon’s altar.\n\n\nPage 12 (Lines 1164 - 1281):\n\n\nThe new suppliant is Polyneices, Oedipus’s son, who is reluctant to come to Oedipus, knowing that his father doesn’t want to see him.\n\n\nAntigone urges Oedipus to meet with Polyneices, emphasizing forgiveness and duty.\n\n\nOedipus agrees and Polyneices comes in laments his family’s fate, says sorry for his past faults and asks for mercy.\n\n\nPage 13 (Lines 1281 - 1409):\n\n\nPolyneices explains how he was exiled by his brother and how the plans to attack Thebes with the support of Argos and talks about the great warriors on his side. He says he can win the battle with Oedipus’s blessing.\n\n\nOedipus curses Polyneices, saying he will never conquer Thebes. He prophesies that he will get killed by his brother and vice versa.\n\n\nThe chorus asks Polyneices, and he starts to leave in sadness, lamenting his failure and thinking about the doom that awaits him.\n\n\nPage 14 (Lines 1409 - 1515):\n\n\nAs he leaves, Polyneices asks his sisters to give him a proper burial. Antigone begs him to abandon the plans to attack Thebes, but Polyneices says honor is above life and leaves.\n\n\nEveryone hears thunder and sees lightning, and Oedipus says that his time has come and asks to summon Theseus.\n\n\nPage 15 (Lines 1516 - 1634):\n\n\nOedipus tells Theseus that the location of his death has to be kept a secret.\n\n\nThey all leave and a messenger comes back to tell the audience that Oedipus has died and gives details about his final moments. He says Oedipus prepared for his death by washing and dressing, then comforted his daughters. A god’s voice was heard - “Oedipus, Oedipus, why delay we to go? Thou tarriest too long.”\n\n\nPage 16 (Lines 1634 - 1779):\n\n\nThe messenger continues recounting the final moments. After Oedipus asks Theseus to swear to protect his daughters, he bids a tearful farewell to his daughters.\n\n\nThe messenger says that Oedipus vanished mysteriously, and when they looked back, they saw only the king.\n\n\nThe daughters mourn their father’s death. Antigone asks to see Oedipus’ tomb, but Theseus refuses. The sisters then ask to be sent back to Thebes, and Theseus agrees.\n\n"},"Book-Notes/Of-Love-and-Other-Demons":{"title":"Of Love and Other Demons by Gabriel Garcia Marquez","links":["Gabriel-Garcia-Marquez"],"tags":["Fiction","Magical-Realism","South-America"],"content":"Of Love and Other Demons by Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nThere are some novels that start slowly, and build up momentum as we progress through the story. And there are others that start with a bang. ‘Of love and other demons’ is definitely in the latter category.\nThe books opens with a letter from Marquez on how he came upon the story. On a routine round to cover a story for his newspaper, the author is sent to find out about the emptying/transportation of crypts of Santa Clara Convent, which is in a dilapidated state. He comes across an astonishing sight when after one of the crypts is open, they see copper colored hair  on a skeleton head. It was as if the hair grew after death out of the skeleton. The author is reminded of a story that his grandmother had told him about a young girl with long hair, who got bitten by a dog, became mad and was later venerated as a saint since she performed miracles.\nFrom the get go, when “an ash gray dog with a white blaze”, charges into a market and bites the protagonist, a young girl who is the daughter of a local nobleman, the novel transports the reader to a different place in a different era, and doesn’t let go. Till the last page, we’re intrigued by what is going to happen and are rooting for Sierva Maria to come out of the whole ordeal victorious.\nI’d always wanted to read Marquez. I’d heard about this famous book ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ in high school or college, as a quiz question or may be it was a crossword puzzle on The Hindu. It was at the back of my mind. I read the prologue of this book our local library and was totally hooked. It was a worth read. AK also read the book. She also bought ‘One Hundred Years’. Haven’t gotten to reading that yet though.\nIn short, the novel is about a young girl getting bitten (very small bite) by a dog. She is actually not affected but due to the rumours and superstitions, she is forced to undergo exorcism by many people. Finally is brought to a convent. The young priest there falls in love with the girl. Though he recommends that she is not mad, the authorities don’t listen. It ends tragically for all the ‘good’ people in the book.\nWhat is good and not good is often a gray area. If you follow society’s norms and act in the way it expects, then you’re branded as good. The religious fanaticism that existed in the 17th century South America exists even today, almost everywhere in the world.\nThe novel explores many themes, and one of them is the fight between good and evil. One could say that the ‘good’ is the truth and everything that is natural in the world. The ‘evil’ is dogma and superstition that plagued the society during that time period. A strong belief in demons and reliance on hearsay, made the people around Sierva Maria see her differently than what she really was. She was just a 12 year old adolescent who was coming out of childhood into adulthood. She was also a victim of neglect by her parents. Her Yoruban beliefs, songs, dances, painting her face black, etc. were part of her growing up and it was natural for her. But it was tangential to her European parents or the Church.\nIn a way, the novel conveys that going against the confines of the present norms can sometimes work, or sometimes go awry. When a new idea upends an old one, it is many times because of myriads of factors that led to that time. Though people always venerate heroes who led the revolution without realizing that the people were the instruments and the revolution would have happened regardless of that particular person.\nAlso, I think the novel depicts that the conflict between good and evil is a human condition. Though we could judge the people based on our moral compass and group them as good vs evil, every person is fighting the battle against evil. What he or she thinks is evil could be based on his/her level of intelligence or what they’ve been told. It is not just the external evil but also the internal one. The internal conflict sometimes manifests externally by being too good to people or too cruel. So a human life’s journey is about fighting their own battle with their hidden evil and also fighting the external forces of evil from their standpoint.\nThe novel also alludes to the fact that people may not fully be in control of their destiny. One can only attempt to be true to oneself and hope that it aligns with the surroundings.\n\nOf Love and Other Demons"},"Book-Notes/Payment-Systems-in-the-US":{"title":"Payment Systems in the US - Second Edition by Carol Coye Benson, Scott Loftesness","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Business","Banking","Fintech"],"content":"This is probably the 3rd time I’m reading this book.

Back in 2005, NC had mentioned him as a great author who wrote cyber thrillers and I should definitely read. Time passed by, I forgot about this and when someone recently mentioned Stephenson in a chat about books, I thought I must get hold of a copy. Reading a paperback after a long time was fun. I felt it didn’t live up to the hype and it took me a bit of time to get into the book. But if you read the backcover, you’d surely be intrigued enough to give it a try. Here it is, verbatim -\n“Only once in a great while does a writer come along who defies comparison—a writer so original he redefines the way we look at the world. Neal Stephenson is such a writer and Snow Crash is such a novel, weaving virtual reality, Sumerian myth, and just about everything in between with a cool, hip cybersensibility to bring us the gigathriller of the information age.”\nThe main takeaway for me was that you could literally die if you read a string of characters in a particular order even if you don’t understand it. I’ve heard of people saying similar things about words that you hear. When you hear words spoken in a specifc sequence, you could get affected. For e.g., magical incantations in Sanskrit or Latin. Since words that you hear and words that you see are processed by the brain, it is theoretically possible that the brain’s wirings could get impacted mysteriously by some sequence that we don’t yet understand."},"Book-Notes/Team-Topologies":{"title":"Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Software-Development","Leadership","Information-Technology"],"content":"\n“If the architecture of the system and the architecture of the organization are at odds, the architecture of the organization wins.”\n~ Ruth Malan (Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow ^1)\n\nNotes\nPART I TEAMS AS THE MEANS OF DELIVERY\nChapter 1: The Problem with Org Charts\n\nCommunication Structures of an Organization\nTeam Topologies: A New Way of Thinking about Teams\nThe Revival of Conway’s Law\nCognitive Load and Bottlenecks\nSummary: Rethink Team Structures, Purpose, and Interactions\n\nChapter 2: Conway’s Law and Why It Matters\n\nUnderstanding and Using Conway’s Law\nThe Reverse Conway Maneuver\nSoftware Architectures that Encourage Team-Scoped Flow\nOrganization Design Requires Technical Expertise\nRestrict Unnecessary Communication\nBeware: Naive Uses of Conway’s Law\nSummary: Conway’s Law Is Critical for Efficient Team Design in Tech\n\nChapter 3: Team-First Thinking\n\nUse Small, Long-Lived Teams as the Standard\nGood Boundaries Minimize Cognitive Load\nDesign “Team APIs” and Facilitate Team Interactions\nWarning: Engineering Practices Are Foundational\nSummary: Limit Teams’ Cognitive Load and Facilitate Team Interactions to Go Faster\n\nPART II TEAM TOPOLOGIES THAT WORK FOR FLOW\nChapter 4: Static Team Topologies\n\nTeam Anti-Patterns\nDesign for Flow of Change\nDevOps and the DevOps Topologies\nSuccessful Team Patterns\nConsiderations When Choosing a Topology\nUse DevOps Topologies to Evolve the Organization\nSummary: Adopt and Evolve Team Topologies that Match Your Current Context\n\nChapter 5: The Four Fundamental Team Topologies\n\nStream-Aligned Teams\nEnabling Teams\nComplicated-Subsystem Teams\nPlatform Teams\nAvoid Team Silos in the Flow of Change\nA Good Platform Is “Just Big Enough”\nConvert Common Team Types to the Fundamental Team Topologies\nSummary: Use Loosely Coupled, Modular Groups of Four Specific Team Types\n\nChapter 6: Choose Team-First Boundaries\n\nA Team-First Approach to Software Responsibilities and Boundaries\nHidden Monoliths and Coupling\nSoftware Boundaries or “Fracture Planes”\nReal-World Example: Manufacturing\nSummary: Choose Software Boundaries to Match Team Cognitive Load\n\nPART III EVOLVING TEAM INTERACTIONS FOR INNOVATION AND RAPID DELIVERY\nChapter 7: Team Interaction Modes\n\nWell-Defined Interactions Are Key to Effective Teams\nThe Three Essential Team Interaction Modes\nTeam Behaviors for Each Interaction Mode\nChoosing Suitable Team Interaction Modes\nChoosing Basic Team Organization\nChoose Team Interaction Modes to Reduce Uncertainty and Enhance Flow\nSummary: Three Well-Defined Team Interaction Modes\n\nChapter 8: Evolve Team Structures with Organizational Sensing\n\nHow Much Collaboration Is Right for Each Team Interaction?\nAccelerate Learning and Adoption of New Practices\nConstant Evolution of Team Topologies\nCombining Teams Topologies for Greater Effectiveness\nTriggers for Evolution of Team Topologies\nSelf Steer Design and Development\nSummary: Evolving Team Topologies\n\nConclusion: The Next-Generation Digital Operating Model\n\nFour Team Types and Three Interaction Modes\nTeam-First Thinking: Cognitive Load, Team API, Team-Sized Architecture\nStrategic Application of Conway’s Law\nEvolve Organization Design for Adaptability and Sensing\nTeam Topologies Alone Are Not Sufficient for IT Effectiveness\nNext Steps: How to Get Started with Team Topologies\n\nAmazon - www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology/dp/1942788819/"},"Book-Notes/The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People":{"title":"7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Steven Covey","links":[],"tags":["Management","Leadership","Motivation","Self-Help","Non-Fiction"],"content":"There are many books that when I think back on them, I have this lingering feeling that either due to reading quickly or not taking notes, I didn’t really take in the full essence of the book. There is more to be understood and when there is time, I need to get back to it. “7 Habits of Highly Effective People” by Steven Covey is one such book. My classmate from school, RR, was probably the first person to recommend the book to me. I have probably read the first chapter at least 5 or 6 times before I finally was able to finish reading the book around 2002 when I was working in Chennai. This is the second time I’ve read this book.\nIt is one of those books which the moment you finish reading, you will feel inspired, to do more, to yearn to lead a more fulfilling life. You will see the world in a new perspective with a feeling within you that things are more in your control than not.\nPART 1 - Paradigms and principles\n\nInside-out\n\n\n”There is no real excellence in all this world which can be separated from right living.&quot;&quot;\n~ David Starr Jordan\n\n\nThe Seven Habits : an overview\n\n\n”We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”\n~ Aristotle\n\nPART 2 - Private victory\nHabit 1 - Be Proactive - Principles of personal vision\n\n”I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.”\n~ Henry David Thoreau\n\nBe proactive and have control over the outcomes rather than being reactive to everything around you.\nHabit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind- Principles of personal leadership\n\n”What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.”\n~ Oliver Wendell Holmes\n\nAlways visualize the end before starting something and this habit will help you focus better towards the goal.\nHabit 3 - Put First Things First - Principles of personal management\n\n”Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.”\n~ Goethe\n\nOnce you begin with end in mind and start implementing things, prioritize so that you always put most important things first.\nPART 3 - Public victory - Paradigms on interdependence\nHabit 4 - Think Win-Win - Principles of interpersonal leadership\n\n”There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity.” ~ Samuel Johnson\n“We have committed the Golden Rule to memory; let us now commit it to life.&quot;&quot; ~ Edwin Markha\n\nMost things in life don’t have to be a zero sum game. Win-Win is based on the assumption that there is plenty for everyone, and that success follows a co-operative approach more naturally than the confrontation of win-or-lose.\nHabit 5 - Seek First to Understand and then to be Understood - Principles of empathic communication\n\n”The heart has its reasons which reason knows not of.” ~ Pascal\n\nHabit 6 - Synergize - Principles of creative cooperation\n\n”I take as my guide the hope of a saint \nin crucial things, unity — \nin important things, diversity — \nin all things, generosity”\n~ Inaugural Address of President George Bush\n\nSynergy means that 1 + 1 may equal 8, 16, or even 1,600.\nPART 4 - Renewal\nHabit 7 - Sharpen the Saw - Principles of balanced self-renewal\n\n”Sometimes when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things… I am tempted to think…there are no little things.”\n~ Bruce Barton\n\n\nInside-out again\n\n\n”The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would  shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature.\n~ Ezra Taft Benson\n"},"Book-Notes/The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant":{"title":"The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness by Eric Jorgenson","links":["The-Knowledge-Project","Shane-Parrish","Naval-Ravikant","Lists/Naval's-Life-Formulas-and-Rules","Lists/Naval's-Recommended-Reading"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help"],"content":"Thoughts\nI got to know about Naval when one of my colleagues, AJ recommended me to watch an episode of The Knowledge Project podcast.

Mathematicians have been responsible for developing the codes that are currently used to protect military information.\n~ Simon Singh, The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography\n\nThoughts\nOver the years he (Babbage) accumulated a thick file of encrypted messages, which he planned to use as the basis for an authoritative book on cryptanalysis, entitled “The Philosophy of Decyphering”. The book would contain two examples of every kind of cipher, one that would be broken as a demonstration and one that would be left as an exercise for the reader.\nWhen I was reading through the above passage, it occurred to me that this is what Simon Singh was doing - Creating a book about deciphering! Full credit to him for weaving interesting tidbits from history and making the book an engaging whodonit story.\nThe best parts are the way the ciphers are broken down and explained that any one could easily understand. Even without the explanations of deciphering specific ciphertext (if you want to skip over that), just the history is fascinating.\nI was surprised (or may be not) that the book started with the story of Mary, the Queen of Scots. I feel that retelling of the stories of Mary, the Queen of Scots, Willam Wallace (Braveheart), Jacobite revolution (Outlander) and other martyrs in the last couple of decades through movies, TV series and books, have made the public feel a kind of kinship with Scotland. There is a kind of romantic allure to Scotland. What better way to hook a reader to a book than start with a story connected to Scotland!\nAnother great thing is, he makes it all so simple and easy to understand something that was otherwise out of the reach for most. He does mention that in the modern age, it is more relevant to everyday life than in the past. Here is a quote from the book -\n\n“Cryptography used to be an obscure science, of little relevance to everyday life. Historically, it always had a special role in military and diplomatic communications. But in the Information Age, cryptography is about political power, and in particular, about the power relationship between a government and its people. It is about the right to privacy, freedom of speech, freedom of political association, freedom of the press, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, freedom to be left alone.”\n\nNotes\nIntroduction\n1 The Cipher of Mary Queen of Scots\nMary the Queen of Scots’s life is on the line. people in the court of Queen Elizabeth are trying to prove that Mary committed treason.

There’s only a certain number of computers attached, yet you never quite reach the edge of the network. There’s always another computer down the line. Eventually, you’ll make a complete circuit and wind up back where you started. Most networks are so complicated and interwoven that no one knows where all their connections lead.”\n~ The Cuckoo’s Egg1\n\nThoughts\nWhat’s the book about?\nIt is a first-person account of a sysadmin (who was an astronomer) at Berkeley tasked with a seemingly innocuous task of tracking down a 75 cent accounting discrepancy of server usage and discovering a secret web of computer network hacking and stealing of classified information. A year-long hunt for the hacker connects Cliff to many government departments and cable network operators across the US and finally finds that the hacking originated from abroad.\nIt is a fascinating book. I had heard a lot about this book and always wanted to read it. It is an engaging book even if you’re not into cybersecurity, though in today’s world, everyone is unwittingly into cybersecurity and should be aware of the security of one’s own data and privacy.\nHowever, it is not just a story about chasing a hacker but a glimpse of society and people interactions. It is a history lesson on how things were networked in the 80s; it’s about life in Berkeley as an astronomer; about how being too passionate about work can affect one’s love life; about persistence, about taking notes, about how frustrating it can be to work with bureaucrats; how to improvise when you don’t have resources; and so on.\nMy key takeaway\nMy big takeaway was that you have to take notes. Being able to journal events of the day and being able to retrieve crucial pieces of information when you need it, is critical to your learning process. Our brain works that way. There are many PKMs2 that allow you to organize notes like a “Second Brain”, a concept popularized by Tiago Forte3.\nThere are a few instances where Cliff talks explicitly about the importance of taking notes. In the first few * Chapters, he mentions -\n\n“The astronomer’s rule of thumb: if you don’t write it down, it didn’t happen.”\n\nThere is also an incident later where someone in the NSA had leaked information about the investigation to DoE. His manager says that not informing DoE was a mistake since their lab got funding from DoE. Cliff points to his notes and says that DoE was informed two months ago and it was documented in the logbook. Here is the quote from the book after this -\n\n“Saved by my logbook. Just like observing at a telescope. If you don’t document it, you might as well not have observed it. Sure, you need powerful telescopes and computers. But without a logbook, your observations won’t amount to much.”\n\nNotes\nHighlights from my kindle\n\nChapter 3\n\nPage 22 · Location 390\nCollect raw data and throw away the expected .

But funds run out and instead of letting him off he is transferred to the computer center. He is grateful that he has a job instead of having to stand on the unemployment line.\nHis neighbors - Wayne an expert who complains and Dave, a Unix Buddha. They manage the computers used by the lab employees.\nOn the second day, Dave hands Cliff a problem of a 75 cent shortfall in the last month’s bill or server usage.\nAfter trying several programs and trial and error, Cliff finds that a user named Hunter had used a server for some time. It was not accounted for since Hunter was not added to the system. He thought the problem is solved.\nNext day they received an email from a computer named Dockmaster saying that their computer was broken into. While investigating this Cliff finds that a user named Sventek had logged in.\nBut Dave says it could not have been Joe Sventek since he had left for England last year.\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA week later Sventek logs in again.\nCliff talks about account types, privileges, people hacking for fun, etc. Could the movie Wargames actually happen? (Reminds me.. I’ve got to watch this! I’ve come across mentions of the movie earlier too.)\nCliff wonders if the user who is accessing the labs computers could be a super-user hacker.\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nInteresting tidbit - Lawrence Berkeley lab and Lawrence Livermore lab - both were named after California’s first Nobel Laureate.\nCliff and Dave go to Rory who is their division head and talk about the hacker. He asks them to find proof.\nCliff writes a program to beep his terminal whenever someone connected to the Unix computer and finds out which port the hacker connector from - tt23. “tt” - dial-in telephones.\nHe decides to printout commands issued by the hacker when they log in.

Things that work magically now used to be so slow in the past.\nIf you need to provide value to the customer, you cannot be bogged down by a system that takes too long to set up, build, make changes and deploy. A lot of these can be streamlined and automated. If you have flaky tests that block your releases and if someone needs to baby-sit releases to make sure nothing goes wrong in production, you’re not operating as efficiently as you could.

In the 21st century, power is easy to get, harder to use - and easy to lose.“\n\n’The End of Power’ was the first book chosen. The theme of the book is that power is not what it used to be. People in power are not as powerful as in the past and not as much as we sometimes think them to be. Power has weakened because barriers to power have reduced by the “More”, “Mobility” and “Mentality” revolution. The book makes one think about the world around us. In a way, the world has become more democratic and ordinary people have access/chance to rise to the top but when one looks at the world from the top, it is more chaotic and difficult to manage. One might choose to not get into management/leadership positions because of this.\nChapter 1\t: The Decay of Power\n\n”Power is the ability to direct or prevent the current or future actions of other groups and individuals.”\n\nThis chapter gives the example of James Black Jr., a 12 yr old from a working class family in Brooklyn, NY who becomes a Chess Grandmaster at the age of 12. It is a global trend. More players are learning the game and achieving mastery sooner than their predecesors, many of them on their own!. The reason is because the easier access to knowledge - of millions of games by other Grandmasters or computer simulation of moves, made by digital revolution and the internet. The author goes on to say that the similar trend is seen in all the other aspects of life. The chapter also gives us an overview of what the book’s is going to talk about.\nChapter 2\t: Making Sense of Power: How It Works and How to Keep It\n\n”Identify the barriers to power and whether they are coming up or going down, and you can solve a large part of the puzzle of power.”\n\nThe main theme of this chapter is extend the definition of power in the first chapter. Power is expressed through four different means - The Muscle, The Code, The Pitch, The Reward.\nMacMillan’s Taxonomy of Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome seen as improvementOutcome seen as nonimprovementChange incentivesInducement via reward: Increase the salary, lower a priceCoercion via muscle: Law enforcement, repression, violenceChange preferencesPersuasion via pitch: Advertising, campaigningObligation via code: Religious or traditional duty, moral suasion\nChapter 3\t: How Power Got Big: An Assumption’s Unquestioned Rise\n\n”Weber’s central message was that without a reliable, well-functioning organization, or, to use his term, without a bureaucracy, power could not be effectively wielded.”\n\nThe main theme of this chapter is to about how companies throughout the world became huge, especially after the World War II. Huge companies could be managed only via hierarchies and bureaucracy. The author talks in depth about Max Weber, German sociologist who analyzed Western economies and wrote about bureaucracy and how it would lead to power being managed by big corporations.\nChapter 4\t: How Power Lost Its Edge: The More, Mobility, and Mentality Revolutions\n\n”The decoupling of power from size, and thus the decoupling of the capacity to use power effectively from the control of a large Weberian bureaucracy, is changing the world.”\n\n\nThe More revolution - Overwhelming the means of control\nThe Mobility revolution - The end of captive audiences\nThe Mentality revolution - Taking nothing for granted anymore\n\nPower and the three revolutions:\n\nChapter 5\t: Why Are Landslides, Majorities, and Mandates Endangered Species?

Goldratt & Jeff Cox","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Business","Leadership","Self-Help","Management"],"content":"The book is about Alex, a plant manager who is in the middle of a very difficult situation. Everything seems to be falling apart. Shipments are always late, backlog is growing, factory is bleeding money though every single person is working hard all the time. The VP comes to the factory and asks about an order that is seven-weeks overdue. He goes into the factory floor and asks folks to stop everything and work on the order that he wants to be done. He yells at the machinist and he quits. The VP tells the manager that the order has to go out today no matter the cost. Also that the factory is running so badly that it will be shut down in 3 months. The manager goes on the floor and finds out that the machinist who quit earlier, is crucial to get the work done fast! To add to all this, his wife is completely upset with him since he is mostly at office and does not give enough time to the family. Tonight he was supposed to take his wife out and it turns out to be an allnighter to deliver an order that VP has asked for. Phew!\nIf anyone thinks that this is a far fetched scenario, I assure you that it is not. It is a day-to-day reality at most of the tech companies, especially the ones on the cutting edge, not to mention Startups. As someone who worked at online companies for the last 15 years, close to a decade at ebay and six years at PayPal, this situation is all too familiar to me. Of course, it depends on the team and role but an online company is 24/7 and unanticipated issues can happen anytime. With SRE on your back and a lot of people asking questions, you could hear the collective heartbeat of the executive team and also\nthe sound of money going down the drain, when there is a production P0 at hand. Impacting the livelihood of merchants is another thing that would spring you to action.\nBut the story is not a sombre one. Alex, the plant manager is able to get out of the trouble. He makes a remarkable turnaround and posts profits every month and delivers orders ahead of time. He also wins back the love of his wife and gets time to spend with his kids.\nAll because he gets a chance to present his problem to his professor in the past and the professor, a wise man, asks a series of great questions. The questions get Alex thinking and he finds solutions by working with his team. The key inputs are the questions raised by the ‘Yoda’ professor, Jonah.\nWhen one is close to the ‘factory’, one tends to dismiss theoretical scientists as moutain-top hermits who are not close to code and don’t know the realities. But the book proves that for critical thinking, one doesn’t have to be working at the lathe, one could as well be outside and observe the workings to analyze what is wrong. This is what Jonah does.\nThe biggest takeaway from the book was that one needs to be clear about what the Goal is. The goal of a company is to make money. Increase throughput, reduce inventory and reduce the operation expenses. Look at the whole operation and find out bottlenecks, reduce bottlenecks to improve throughput. The key thing is to sell quality products which could translate in software terms to ‘ship code’.\nPlanning makes all the difference. The team is able to deliver a sudden order of 1000 parts without overworking or spending time in the weekends because they do things in a methodical manner.\nOverall, it is a great book and I’m so glad that someone recommended this to me. For new managers, it might help them be better managers, for existing managers who are finding it tough to juggle all the balls in the air, it would offer hope - to think, to look for new solutions, and be optimistic. The best thing is, it is a business book that is written as a story, a thriller, where you’re turning the next page to find out what happened!\n\nThe Goal on Amazon - The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement"},"Book-Notes/The-Great-Mental-Models,-Volume-1":{"title":"The Great Mental Models, Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts by Shane Parrish","links":["Shane-Parrish"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Business","Philosophy","Mental-Models"],"content":"\n“The quality of your thinking depends on the models that are in your head.”\n~ The Great Mental Models, Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts1 by Shane Parrish &amp; Rhiannon Beaubien\n\nThoughts\nI was introduced to The Knowledge Project2 by AJ last year during one of our 1-1 walks around the campus. He sent me the link to Naval Ravikant’s podcast3 after the walk, and I listened to it in the bus on the way back home. It was one of the best podcasts that I had listened to and was totally taken aback. It was like listening to a philosopher.  I subscribed to the podcast and to the newsletter. One of the newsletters earlier this month spoke about the release of Volume 2 of The Great Mental Models. And I was like, wow, I haven’t even read the first volume. In order to be not left behind, I bought the kindle version of the books right away and started reading it.\nIt is a good read. But I think, it is one of those books where the hardcover would be better. Better formatted, with right things in the right pages. The book has many ‘sidebar’ anecdotes or snippets that are very interesting but break the flow of the current topic at hand. Also, sometimes a picture that a paragraph refers to, could be found a couple of pages later. A kindle book is great when the content is mostly just text and it flows continuously. Going by the pictures of the book pages on fs.blog4, looks like the hardcover would be a good buy. Probably will wait for all the books in the series to come out.\nWhat is a Mental Model?\nAs the book says, ‘A mental model is simply a representation of how something works.’ It is a way of looking at things and approaching problems that are presented to us. The chief goal in life, i.e if you want a comfortable life, is to have as few blind spots as one can. Either you work in a narrow area of your expertise or learn fast or try different things, you’re always consciously or unconsciously trying to figure out how to make tomorrow better than today. I feel that everyone has a mental model of what is needed to effectively do something. They are all probably smaller variations of some universal mental models. Knowing more, would enable us to think better and make informed decisions.\nThe book presents nine mental models as ‘general thinking concepts’. They are things that you’ve probably already heard of of know, but it is presented in a simple manner, with great quotes and memorable anecdotes.\nThe following are the mental models -\n\nThe Map is not the Territory\nCircle of competence (Supporting Idea - Falsifiability)\nFirst principles thinking\nThought experiment (Supporting Idea - Necessity and Sufficiency)\nSecond-order thinking\nProbabilistic thinking (Supporting Idea - Causation vs Correlation)\nInversion\nOccam’s razor\nHanlon’s razor\n\nNotes\n1. The Map is not the territory\nIn ‘The Map is not the territory’ the Authors outline that the ‘map’ is a miniature version of the land and not the land itself. Knowing the map can help navigate the terrain but only going on the terrain gives full understanding of the terrain. Maps are very useful since they abstract away a lot of complexities and information bloat. When we read news or a book summary, we’re reading abstractions created by other people who have condensed the information to smaller chunks to represent the actual information. The key issue with using maps is many times, we mistake map for the reality.\nIf I think of religion, I think though most religions have doctrines that are universal, many have rules that were written in the context of some particular scenario which has probably no relevance now. Map is useful only if we’re able to use feedback loops to update the map based on the changed terrain.\nThe chapter gives example of Newtonian physics and how it couldn’t explain interstellar phenomena that Einstein’s Special theory of relativity explains well.\nI didn’t quite understand if the sidebar on ‘Tragedy of Commons’ was cautioning against every person looking out to profit for themselves or not. Probably it means that if we’re working on a shared resource, the map becomes useless if everyone does things that doesn’t align with ‘sharing’ principle.\nIn order to use the map effectively, one must take 3 important considerations -\n\na. Reality is the ultimate update - The actual terrain may be different, map might have missed something.\nb. Consider the cartographer - The map maker might not be objective. What you might be seeing is one representation.\nc. Maps can influence territories - It is dangerous to fit complexity into simplification or extrapolate wrongly.\n\nThe chapter concludes by a short snippet about Frederick Taylor’s Scientific Theory of Management of breaking down tasks into smaller pieces and specializing people which worked great on the factory floor but had to be changed with time in different office settings. I couldn’t but wonder if Agile methodology is same as this!\n2. Circle of competence\nWhen one knows little, there is a sense of feeling of high confidence. The unknown unknowns are a lot. The chapter talks about a novice vs a lifer. A lifer is someone who has been in the place or industry for a long time and knows a lot of things about the domain. It would always make sense to get inputs from a lifer. To have a lifer as a mentor would be a great asset. Having sherpas as guides to climb Mt. Everest is a good example. A lifer/competent person knows what he/she doesn’t know and is able to make quickly and relatively accurately.\nAlso, even if you are an expert now, you should not operate as though the circle of competence is static. You must keep the knowledge updated. There are 3 key practices to build/maintain the circle of competence.\n\nWillingness to learn\nMonitor track record in areas that you have/want to have competence\nOccasionally solicit external feedback\n\n3 parts to successfully operate outside the circle of competence -\n\nLearn by basics while acknowledging that you’re a novice.\nTalk to experts\nUse a broad understanding of the basic mental models of the world to augment your understanding of the new field.\n\nThe chapter cites examples of Queen Elizabeth 1, Warren Buffet’s advice on not straying from the circle of competence.\nFalsifiability - If you can’t prove something wrong, you can’t really prove it right either. if you keep eliminating things that don’t work, you strengthen things that work (evolution example). Karl Popper, who propounded the theory of Falsifiability, also put forth another idea on our false notion of historicism. We use examples from the past to make definite conclusions about what is going to happen in the future. This is dangerous. Think of the worst events in history. We look at the worst in the past and prepare for that. But the future could be worse than the worst.\n3. First Principles Thinking\nThis is a way of breaking down any complex system or ideas into simple fundamental things, or building blocks. Once you see everything in terms of first principles, you’d be able to see how disparate things are connected. It is like taking apart a computer or a machine and putting it together. Once you’re able to do that you’re not only able to debug issues faster but also build new systems from the building blocks.\nTwo techniques - Socratic questioning and the Five Whys.\nSocratic questioning - disciplined questioning process, stops one from relying on gut and limits strong emotional responses.\nFive Whys - Determine the root cause of something by repeatedly asking ‘Why’. Each why is based on the previous answer.\nFirst principles thinking gives amazing results and innovative breakthroughs. E.g - H.pylori (stomach bacteria) discovery by Marshall and Warren, Curved carrier chute by Temple Grandin,First principles of meat, etc.\n4. Thought Expriment\nThought exeperiment is a technique wherein one uses imagination to think through things that are not in existence or are not available currently. Lot of philosophical ideas have been based on thought experiements.\nThe chapter examines 3 areas in which thought experiments are very useful -\n\n\nImagining physical impossibilities - e.g. Einsten’s theory of Relativity or the train and the platform example in Stephen Hawking’s ‘A Brief History of Time’.\n\n\nRe-imagining history - This is one of my favorite things to think about thing. Love TV series like ‘The Man in the High Castle’, ‘Outlander’, ‘12 Monkeys’, ‘Battlestar Galactica’, ‘The Expanse’, etc. which dwell not only on alternate history but also possible futures.\n\n\nIntuiting the non-intuitive - A thought experiment allows us to verify if our gut instincts are correct or not.\n\n\nNecessity and Sufficiency -\n\nThe gap between what is necessary to succeed and what is sufficient is often luck, chance, or some other factor beyond your direct control.\n\nThe hard truth - There could be thousands of people who write well and are able to publish but everyone cannot be J.K Rowling. Talent and hardwork is necessary to become a published author but not sufficient to become J.K Rowling. The gap, is huge!\n5. Second-Order Thinking\nAlmost everyone can think of immediate consequences of doing something. But about the ripple effects? Second-order thinking is the ability think farther than immediate consequences. A lot of disasters in the world could be attributed to lack of second-order thinking.\nExample - During the colonial rule, The British wanted to reduce the number of poisonous snakes in Delhi and announced a reward for people who brought in dead snakes. People did. By growing more snakes to make money, they inadvertently increased the number of snakes!\nUse of plastics, smoking, bad city planning, overgrazing - there are too many examples of lack of thought when we look around the world.\n\nStupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results.\n~ Margaret Atwood\n\nWhat a quote !\nThe key think is to think forward as much as possible with all the information at hand. “Haste makes waste!“\n6. Probabilistic Thinking\nProbablistic thinking is to try to estimate the likelihood of an outcome by using data at hand. The whole world probably runs on Probablity! A self-driving car, a complex search algorithm, a Machine Learning model, they’re all using probability to produce an outcome that is most likely. The same is probably true of our minds also. The feedback loop is pretty great for our brains though. The success of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) is greatly due to it being modeled after neurons. Probablistic thinking avoids analysis paralysis and also waiting for ever for all the perfect data to be made available.\nThree important aspects that you need to be aware\n\nBayesian thinking / Conditional probability - When making uncertain decisions, it is always important to check prior conditions.\nFat-tailed curves - Beware of fat-tailed curves. They distort risk estimations. A small error is measuring the risk of an extreme event can mean we’re way off - by orders of magnitude, not 100 fold but 10,000 fold. I think the corona virus epidemic and the lack of preparation is a good example.\nAssymetries - How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% early? Almost never? How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% late? All the time? Or when you aim to get 25% returns on an investment, are you more likely to get 10% (-15) or 40% (+15) ?\n\n7. Inversion\nInversion is a technique to think from the opposite end of the problem. Flip the problem, think backward, start from the end rather than beginning, etc.\nThe chapter gives example of Edward Bernays’s revolutionary campaign to get women to smoke cigarettes. He approached by problem by imagining how it would be if smoking was already an accepted norm.\nIf you’re stuck with something, invert. Even if not stuck, it always helps to think from different angles.\n8. Occam’s razor\nThe simplest solutions are most likely to be the right ones. Simple explanations are more likely than complex ones.\nDavid Hume was very cautious about believing in miracles.\nVera Rubin was able to explain behavior of galaxies using the simpler theory of ‘dark matter’\n9. Hanlon’s razor\nA lot of things that we attribute to malice might be more easily explained by stupidity or laziness. Brings me back to the earlier quote from Margaret Atwood - “Stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results.”\n\nBook cover Image Credit: Amazon\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\n\nParrish, Shane, et al.

On the one hand, it was nostalgic, and on another, it was an eye-opener to know how things are connected. It took me back to my school days where I had learnt a lot of basic concepts like inertia, friction, evolution, etc. There is joy in learning for the sake of knowing things and in school, you get to learn new things in each class and it is a wonderful experience. Math and Physics were my favorite subjects in school, closely followed by Biology and Chemistry. As adults we read more and are exposed to more information on a daily basis, it is not the same as structured learning in school. As kids we learn new things in a variety of subjects but as adults the learning is sometimes focused on narrow areas of work or the group we’re in.\nOf late, there are talks all over the world about overhauling the educational systems because, there is a general dissatisfaction and misunderstanding about what needs to be taught. Some want to reduce pure sciences and focus more on practical training, some want to focus on nationalism and history, some want to go back to religious teachings that are centuries older, and so forth. Instead of building upon what we have, there is a tendency to erase and start afresh. In the chapter on ‘Hierarchies’, Parrish cites the example of the French revolution to show that “People could not destroy the hierarchy altogether; they just ended up with a new form of it.” We see examples of this over and again. People who don’t learn from history are cursed to repeat it.\nThis book is a testament to the fact that learning basic sciences is crucial to our knowledge. They give us the building blocks using which so many of the happenings in the world can be explained. The world is a mystery when we’re born, and through every waking moment, we’re trying to make sense of it. Even the basic understanding of the Sun, the Moon, other animals, and vegetation will be flawed if we were to make our own theories about them. Centuries of research and debates have given rise to the current understanding of the world. We could seek to learn from them, understand that and add to it. By refining our understanding at different stages with new information, we can always connect the dots and fill the blanks. The best way to gain more understanding is to have different mental models and apply them to various situations.\nThe book covers terms in Physics (relativity, thermodynamics, inertia, friction, viscosity, velocity, leverage, etc.), terms in Chemistry (catalyst, alloying, etc.), and terms in Biology (evolution, ecosystem,  replication, etc.) and explains how these fundamental concepts have parallels in social situations. One gets the feeling that everything is an interconnected web. Even a few of these mental models could be used for most situations in life and knowing them is incredibly useful. Shane says at the end of the book that these are tools and not necessarily connected together. It is for us to pick and choose what makes sense for us to form a latticework of models that we can best apply.\nThere are some great quotes in the book and a lot of enriching references. It is also an introduction to a lot of famous people - Aristotle, Rafi’ al-Tahtawi, Norman Bethune, Hadrian, Alice Hamilton, Lise Meitner, Taiichi Ohno, Napoleon Bonaparte, Mae West, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Leonardo da Vinci, Heidi Lamar, Frank Lloyd Wright, Geerat Vermeij etc. Also, many women scientists whose contributions were incredible but not well known. Overall, it is a great book to be read and reflected upon.\nAs I was reading this over the last week, I got this quote from James Clear’s newsletter2 last Thursday and thought it was quite timely -\n“The fastest way to improve is to learn from others.\nRead good books\nTalk to people who have done it\nSoak up the lessons of the past\nLearn from the experiments history has already run and you can start the race halfway finished.”\nNotes\nIntroduction\n\nVolume 1 had introduced 9 General Thinking concepts which had broad applicability.\nVolume 2 explores fundamental ideas from physics, chemistry, and biology and how these ideas offer insights that we can apply to improve our lives.\nLife will be better if we “work with nature instead of against it”. That needs the effort to understand nature itself. e.g. - Fram boat anecdote from In Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life by Helen Czerski. No one was able to get to North Pole since ships got destroyed due to the pressure from ice. Fram boat was designed to float on top of ice when the pressure from ice on both sides increased.\nModels in the book are value-neutral. They can be used to highlight positive or negative aspects of a situation. They function as metaphors or tools of comparison. They are tools that can be used in myriad ways.\n\nPhysics\nRelativity\n\nPut it into perspective.\n\n\nThere is more than one way of looking at things. All perspectives may not be equally valid though.\nThe key thing is to acknowledge that we may not have the full picture.\nE.g. - Galileo’s thought experiment about a person dropping a ball from a moving ship. The person in the ship sees it vertically moving down, a stationary person outside might see the lateral movement.\nE.g. - Einstein’s thought experiment about a person in a moving train seeing light from 2 ends of a train. The person sees light from the front first, but the person outside sees both arriving at the center simultaneously. I think this was mentioned in Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time”3.\nE.g. - Eyewitness testimony - from Rashomon4, a famous Japanese movie about differences in the testimonies of several eyewitnesses to a crime.\nE.g. - Chris Kinison’s killing in 2000. shows that Self-interest and time can distort a person’s memory.\nE.g. - Seeing things in a new lens. Story of 6 Muslim students from Iran in London in 1815. Mirza Salih, one of the students kept a diary of his experiences and his account of a visit to a museum shows how he was able to compare Iranian history with other countries.\nE.g. - Egyptian named al-Tahtawi traveled to Paris in the late 1820s and wrote about his 5 yrs in Paris and this had cultural and scientific impact in his country.\nSummary - In the physical world, relativity exists because things are moving in relation to other things. It is the same in the social world, there are always moving parts and different ways of looking at things.\n\nReciprocity\n\nGive and Take.\n\n\nNewton’s third law - “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”\nPhysical world examples - gravity, jet propulsion, tackling in football, etc.\nGiving is as valuable as having. But doesn’t mean that for every good thing that you do, you get corresponding amount of positive results.\nCommon phrases - “Quid pro quo” (something for something), “tit for tat” (this for that), “do ut des” (I give, so that you may give)\nE.g. - Norman Bethune, a Canadian surgeon, who provided medical services free to the poor and established a free-of-charge clinic when he was working in Montreal, who designed and developed the first ever mobile blood transfusion unit while in Spain, went to China in 1938 and was responsible in setting up a lot of medical infrastructure that saved millions of lives. His achievements are regarded as heroic in China even to this day.\nWhen we give, we get. We improve our physical health and feel better about ourselves and our place in the world.\nConcept - “Loss Aversion” - When compared directly, losses always loom larger than gains. This prevents people from giving if there is a risk of getting nothing at all.\nConcept - “Shadenfreude” - Joy in someone else’s misfortune. We feel strongly when someone’s misfortune seems to be earned, something that happened due to their misdeeds.\nE.g - “Eternal Treaty” between Egyptians and Hittites at a time when fighting wars and winning was the norm. This established peace which was very useful to both countries. They got more in return.\nSummary - “Be the change you want to see.” Small changes in your actions change your entire world.\n\nThermodynamics\n\nReduce chaos and find order.\n\n\nLaws of Thermodynamics -\n\nFirst Law (Law of Conservation of Energy) - Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. It can only be transferred.\nSecond Law - Entropy of any isolated system always increases.\nThird Law - Entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.\nFourth Law (Zeroth Law) - If two objects are in thermal equilibrium with a third object, then those two objects are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.\n\n\nEquilibrium\n\nSystems always tend to move towards equilibrium. If there is hot object next to cold, there is energy transfer towards making both at the same temperature.\nE.g. - Hadrian’s wall (facilitate interaction) - Used to control the movement of people.\nE.g. - Great Wall of China (prevent interaction) - designed to prevent mingling of people/cultures. Was not successful since equilibrium cannot be avoided.\nE.g. - Berlin Wall - built to stop movement of ideas and people. People still crossed, at great risks to themselves, many getting killed in the process.\n\n\nDisorder\n\nLife is naturally disorderly and a constant effort is needed to maintain structure.\nE.g. - Fairy tales, structure of a story, Hero’s journey.\n\n\nSummary - Barriers you erect will face a relentless pressure to get broken. Understanding randomness and bringing order is a basic pursuit of human life.\n\nInertia\n\nNothing happens unless something moves.\n\n\nNewton’s first law of motion (Inertia) - “An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.”\nInertia helps explain why we continue with bad habits and why it is so difficult to make a systemic change.\nOnce an idea gets rolling, it can be hard to stop. Momentum (p) = m*v, greater the mass and velocity, greater the momentum.\nE.g. Harmful effect of lead. Over time lead got used in so many different places that in spite of overwhelming evidence of its bad effect, it could not be removed from the day-to-day things.\nE.g. Absinthe - In contrast to lead, this lasted only for 50 yrs before it was banned altogether. Mass matters! It was easier to Absinthe out of the market.\nIntertia in War - If soldiers are able to rest well, they build better momentum.\nEscape velocity - The force that is needed to escape gravitation pull is highest at the beginning.\nE.g. Lise Meitner - Great researcher whose contributions were not recognized since she was a woman. But she persevered and continued her good work. Was instrumental in discovering nuclear fission. Was nominated for Nobel prize 29 times by Niels Bohr.\nSummary - Getting started is the hard part.\n\nFriction and Viscosity\n\nMovement is a battle.\n\n\nFriction - force that opposes movement of objects that are in contact with each other. Overcoming friction needs extra energy.\nViscosity - Meausure of how hard it is to move through a liquid.\nTwo aspects - a) What is easy in one might be hard on another. b) Scale matters (a tiny fish has to try hard to move through viscous sea water which is much easier for a whale)\nE.g. - Agnes Pockels, 19th century physicist who studied on her own and succedeed in a higly viscous environment which was against women.\nE.g. - Chernobyl nuclear power plant issue - Viscous information environment made information flow very difficult and that resulted in millions getting killed.\nE.g. - Inefficiency at mass-production systems that were studied by Toyota. Friction to change. Lean methodology by Taiichi Ohno mitigates the problem by reducing the friction at the working level.\nSummary - There is always something trying to slow us down. Reducing resistance is often easier than using more force.\n\nVelocity\n\nDirection over speed.\n\n\nIt is much more important to pay attention to where you are going and not how fast you are moving.\nE.g. - Napoleon who was famous for his focus on speed towards a goal. This won him many battles. But the focus on this without accounting for factors that can limit it, can be dangerous. For e.g. Napoleon’s battle against Russia which was a failure since the distance was long and half the army died before reaching Moscow and had to return.\nE.g. - Mae West who was intensely focused on her career and diligently worked towards improving it. She was the highest woman earner in the U.S. at one point int time.\nSummary - Direction and speed are very important. We must adjust our tactics to continue towards our direction.\n\nLeverage\n\nEnough to move the world\n\n\nArchimedes - Said he could lift the Earth with the right lever.\nThree main types of physical levers - a) Force/Fulcrum/Weight (using a crowbar to open a door); b)Fulcrum/Weight/Force (wheelbarrow); c) Fulcrum/Force/Weight (baseball bat).\nRoger Volkema, in “Leverage”, two principles - a) perception, b) social construct\nWhen need to know three things - a) Do I have it? b) Where and when should I apply it? c) How do I keep it?\nE.g. - Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was Queen of France and then England, had a lot of influence through leverage that she learnt to wield.\nE.g. - The dark side of Leverage - The coal companies in West Virginia who kept the workers in ignorance and poverty.\nSummary - Simply working hard towards a path is probably not the right solution. The right one is to identify the appropriate levers use them appropriately to put effort in the right areas.\n\nChemistry\nActivation Energy\n\nGet to the end.\n\n\nActivation energy is the energy required for a chemical system to initiate and complete a reaction. Once heat is applied, molecules collide, the transition state is unstable and finally a new compound is created or the original ingredients are transformed.\nEvery reaction needs a minimum level of activation energy. One sheet of newspaper is not enough to start and sustain a fire in the fireplace. It may burn and then die out. It takes more paper, fires in multiple points to get the logs burning.\nBigger and more challenging something is, more activation energy is needed.\nE.g. - Getting out of addiction.\nE.g. - Thomas Sankara from Burkina Faso, a western African country who built a campaign, mobilizing support from the ground and overthrew the political system.\nE.g. - Countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand experienced periods of intense growth but only the first 3 succeeded in turning that into a sustainable long-term system.\nSummary - Determining and using the right amount of activation energy is crucial to making lasting changes. If the amount is not right, the change will fizzle out.\n\nCatalysts\n\nChange agent.\n\n\nCatalysts accelerate change. Without them, the actual change may take a significantly more time. Moreover, catalysts are not changed by the change that they bring about.\nE.g. - Catalytic converters in cars (diesel &amp; gas), alcohol manufacture, soap manufacture, Elizabeth Fulhame and her work on oxidation, Industrial Revolution, the printing press, the black death, private spaces in homes (Louis XV)\nSummary - People and technology often act as catalysts. The goal should be to either be a catalyst or use a catalyst to speed up transformations.\n\nAlloying\n\nGreater than the sum of its parts\n\n\nAlloy - A mixture, either in solution or compound, of two or more metals, or a metal and a nonmetal.\nE.g. - Sumerians made bronze (90% copper, 10% tin) which was better than copper or tin in isolation. Steel (iron + carbon) is much harder than pure iron.\nMedicine - A combination of two or more drugs could have a greater benefit than each drug separately.\nLife - We may not have all the skills needed to complete something. If we partner with someone, that creates an alloy which could be stronger than each.\nE.g. - Two men beating an army - Tecumseh a Shawnee chief and Isaac Brock, a Major-General in the British army, worked together to keep Americans out of Canadian territory.\nKnowledge is the ultimate alloy. We learn from others, the concepts that we learn are made stronger with experience.\nFive components of knowledge by Aristotle - science (episteme), art/craft (techne), practical knowledge (phronesis), intuitive apprehension (nous) and wisdom (sophia).\nE.g. - Leonardo da Vinci was a creative genius mainly because he combined knowledge from different disciples.\nSummary - With the right mixture, one + one can really equal ten. Alloying produces something that is greater than its parts.\n\nBiology\nEvolution Part One: Natural Selection and Extinction\n\nAdapt or die.\n\n\nNatural Selection - The frequency of traits within a population changes as a response to environmental conditions, resulting in species that are more adaptable to the environment.\nTwo species requiring the same resources cannot coexist in the same area.\nThere are over 10 million distinct species with only 20% being catalogued! So many species might be going extinct without us knowing.\nE.g. - Evolution of language. There have been thousands of languages over centuries and most are dead now. French is simpler and more adaptable than Latin. Hence it survived.\nSummary - The world is constantly changing and we need to adapt in order to survive.\n\nEvolution Part Two: Adaptation Rate and the Red Queen Effect\n\nGetting better all the time.\n\n\nAdaptation requires understanding the environment and what is changing in it.\nE.g. French in World War II were prepared for how they fought World War I and won and got defeated by Germany.\nThe Red Queen effect - “It takes all the running you can do, to be in the same place”. It is a sobering thought. Being lazy and not doing anything will set you back.\nApplication to Business - Competitors are always working to get ahead, Customers are changing, needs are changing, so one must always try to get ahead of oneself. Standing still means taking a setback.\nVestigial structures - If it does no harm, and doesn’t consume energy to maintain, don’t bother.\nExaptation - An animal produces something to adapt to some situation and that gets used for a totally different purpose. E.g. feathers in birds first provided heat and attractiveness and later got used to help in flight, Self-playing piano, remote-controlled torpedo.\nGreat quotes - “We don’t always know the value of something at the outset, and there doesn’t always have to be a justification for doing everything.”, “Having to know the benefit of everything before you begin leads to missed opportunities.”\nE.g. When Radium was invented, no one knew it could be used in hospitals. Play-Doh was used as wallpaper cleaner for 20 yrs before becoming a household toy, Botox is toxin that causes paralysis but is used to cure muscle and limb spasms.\nSummary - Adaptations and exaptations are part of a continuous process that are needed to survive in a changing world. Success comes from being flexible to change.\n\nEcosystem\n\nEverything is connected.\n\n\nEcosystem - Community of interacting species and their environment, an intricate web with multitude of dependencies.\nSaving an animal from extinction by breeding them in a cage is not as effective as protecting their ecosystem.\nKeystone animals and ones that play crucial role in the ecosystem and if their numbers dwindle, it could destroy the system.\nTrade ecosystem, 3 lessons -\n\na) If you try to close off a section of the system, it will self-organize in a different way. Story of China banning all trade fearing a weakening of power, but trade continued.\nb) When external factors come in, one needs to adapt. When trade opened up many adapted to producing Silk.\nc) Ecosystems are resilient - e.g. Chinese community in Manila.\n\n\ne.g. - Bill Walsh - created a culture that valued a well-functioning ecosystem that helped 49ers become champions.\nSummary - Everything is connected and small actions can have unintended consequences. Hence we must think before effecting a change.\n\nNiches\n\nFind a good fit.\n\n\nGeneralists can survive and flourish in any setting. Specialists thrive in stable conditions.\nConvergence - Features and behaviors are similar when conditions are similar. E.g. - Wings of bats and birds, features of species from different continents. The number of ways to fulfill a function is finite.\nThis could also mean that the same culture across difference places, could produce similar results.\nCoke is an example of being a generalist.\nSummary - There is a trade-off between specialization and generalization. Specialization means less stress but cannot survive in all conditions, while it is the opposite for generalization.\n\nSelf-Preservation\n\nSurvive to thrive.\n\n\nSelf-preservation a fundamental behavior to all organisms.\nAnimals do a lot of things to protect themselves. Many animals do selfless things for the self-preservation of the community or species.\nE.g. - Gioconda Belli and the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in the 1970s.\nE.g. - Derinkuyu: Turkey’s ancient underground city.\nSummary - Self-preservation is a core instinct that explains a lot of irrational things that we might do.\n\nReplication\n\nCopy, copy, copy.\n\n\nmitosis - making identical copy, meiosis - reproduction, creating new possibilities.\nE.g. - Habsburg family - They went into ruin due to generations of intermarriage.\nE.g. - Germans getting defeated by French. Four elements of commander’s intent: formulate, communicate, interpret, and implement. The key thing is to have flexibility to implement at the ground level.\nReplicating a culture - example of tea.\nWe don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Often a great starting point is from something that already exists.\n\nCooperation\n\nWork Together\n\n\nThis is similar to Alloying. The sum is greater than its parts. It is what really helped in the development of human civilization and build complex societies.\nDunbar Number\n\n5 people: Inner core of closeness. Partners, family, best friends.\n15 people: Close friend group.\n50 people: Basic friends and acquaintances.\n150 people: Part of a community.\n500 people: Friends of friends.\n1500 people: Upper limit which includes number of faces that you can put names to.\n\n\n\nHierarchical Organization\n\nKnow your place\n\n\nHierarchies can be found everywhere in the animal kingdom. E.g. Hens, Chimpanzees.\nPlato &amp; Plotinus - The entire universe is arranged in a hierarchical structure. Pebbles, soil, etc. at the bottom, plants, then animals, humans and god at the top.\nFrench society before the revolution had 3 estates : 1st Estate - Church and Clergy, 2nd Estate - Aristocracy, 3rd Estate - everyone else (~98%). During the revolution, a vast majority was in abject poverty. People overthrew the system and instilled another which was even worse. But in all subsequent systems, there was some kind of hierarchy.\nE.g. - Chile miners who formed their own hierarchy while trapped in a mine.\nSummary - Hierarchy is core to most animals. Lack of hierarchy and too much hierarchy leads to unrest.\n\nIncentives\n\nShape Behavior\n\n\nConsistent but infrequent rewards &gt; frequent rewards. infrequent rewards give better behavioral changes.\nDrive for incentives is everywhere. People decide on immediate rewards while voting or doing many things in life. CEOs with short tenure think of immediate goals, people with quarterly use-it-or-lose-it budget spend recklessly towards the end.\nE.g. - Thalidomide drug of the 50s. It was destructive but was sold in so many places across the world due to the incentives given to people in the sales and others in the middle. Luckily U.S got saved due to Dr. Frances Kelley.\nSummary - Incentive can shape behavior. We’re wired to respond to it. Companies, organizations focused on incentives can manipulate people into doing the wrong things.\n\nTendency to Minimize Energy Output\n\nLeast effort principle\n\n\nAll living beings have developed mechanisms to increase their energy efficiency. E.g. - turtles, sharks\nHeuristics - We take good enough decisions and not the best ones.\nSatisficing - We search for the first thing in our brain that satisfies our minimum acceptable conditions.\nRemember base rates and pay attention to quality of data.\nCubicle or not - Very good argument against open plan offices.\nSummary - We have a natural tendency to minimize energy. Sometimes it helps, many times it gets in the way of doing difficult things.\n\n\nBook cover Image Credit: Amazon\nFootnotes\n\n\nParrish, Shane, et al.

I finished the first half of the first book in the series. The Iliad!\nAs mentioned in the previous post, as I read The Iliad, I picked a quote/passage, crafted a prompt to tie it to some contemporary issue, and submitted the prompt to ChatGPT and Bard. They definitely gave me interesting answers, which made me think further. I posted them on Substack as and when I read them, usually scheduling the newsletter to go out the next day at midnight.\nI thought I would read a chapter a day and finish by the end of  April, but other priorities took over, and I could finish the book only by today. I was reminded of the movie “Troy” and couldn’t but not think of Brian Cox when Agamemnon came up and Brad Pitt when Achilles. The movie wasn’t entirely faithful to the book, but it was a well-made one.\nHere are the episodes and the posts. I configured Substack to make it free for one month and subscriber-only after that. So if you’re reading this after June 22, 2023, all the episodes on Iliad will be for subscribers only.\nMay 31 update - Took all the Substack posts and converted them into an ebook and published it on Amazon. It was great to get it done on May 31st since that is a key date for me personally. Creating the ebook was a bit tougher in the beginning since the formatting options on kindle create was limited, but in retrospect, I think it was good. With more editing options, I may not have completed the book soon. I just used only the standard elements - Title, Subtitle, Opening quote, Subheading and Body text.\nSubstack Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDateTitle/LinkChapterTopic of DiscussionApr 1Great Books Ep 1: The Sword and the Crown: Differing perspectives on Personal GloryThe Iliad - Book 1Is leadership a show of strength?

Christensen","links":["Book-Notes/The-Goal","Effective-Executive","Good-to-Great","David-vs-Goliath"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Business","Leadership","Management"],"content":"Comments\nBack in 2020, when I wrote a post on The Goal, I’d mentioned that it was one of the 3 books1 that Jeff Bezos used to ask his Senior Managers to read. At that point, I’d read 2 of the 3 books - Effective Executive by Drucker and The Goal by Goldratt. The one that was left to read was “The Innovator’s Dilemma”. It is a phenomenal book to read. Great quotes, examples and life lessons to learn from. In some ways, it goes against some of the principles in Good to Great. It says that good management was the most powerful reason many big companies failed to stay atop their industries.\n”If good management practice drives the failure of successful firms faced with disruptive technological change, then the usual answers to companies, problems — planning better, working harder, becoming more customer-driven, and taking a longer-term perspective — all exacerbate the problem. Sound execution, speed-to-market, total quality management, and process reengineering are similarly ineffective.”\nIn spirit, it is similar to Gladwell’s David vs Goliath. David is nimble, and has lot more freedom for manouverability but Goliath is huge, has a heavy armor and is limited in mobility and what he can use.\nNotes\nIntroduction\nquotes\n\n”An organization’s capabilities reside in two places. The first is in its processes — the methods by which people have learned to transform inputs of labor, energy, materials, information, cash, and technology into outputs of higher value. The second is in the organization’s values, which are the criteria that managers and employees in the organization use when making prioritization decisions.”\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\n\nweb.archive.org/web/20140819090050/http://www.businessinsider.com.au/jeff-bezos-favorite-business-books-2013-9 ↩\n\n\n"},"Book-Notes/The-King's-General":{"title":"The King's General by Daphne du Maurier","links":["Gone-with-the-Wind","Richard-Grenvile","Honor-Harris","Menabilly"],"tags":["Fiction","Romance","Historical"],"content":"{{&lt; img src=“/images/img/general/blog3_menabilly.jpg” width=“100%”&gt;}}\n\nThe “The Kings General” is unlike any novel that I’ve read. It’s as pacy as a modern day thriller. Reminds me of Gone with the Wind though. It is about Richard Grenvile, the king’s General in the west, the bravest amongst the brave, the lion of the times, the king’s darling, the rebels’ dread and about the only woman in the world he cared for : Honor Harris – a beautiful lady who was crippled just a day before their marriage in a tragic accident.\nThe novel is a first person narrative by Honor and from the time it starts with her brother Kit’s marriage to Gartred Grenvile, events unfurl one after another so quickly that within no time you would find yourself in Menabilly amidst a raging civil war between the forces of the King and the Parliament, pausing probably in the middle during the accident which cripples Honor, more due to shock than because the story slackens in pace there.\n\nHeader Image - “The Cornish coast at Menabilly” by Matt Buck via Flickr"},"Book-Notes/The-ONE-Thing":{"title":"The One Thing by Gary Keller","links":[],"tags":["Self-Help","Business","Productivity","Non-Fiction"],"content":"The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Result by Gary Keller with Jay Papapsan\n\n”If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.” ~ Russian Proverb\n\nThis is the first book that I’m reading from “Prime Reading” catalog. I discovered Prime reading accidentally, that too when searching for deals during thanksgiving !! It is a great offering from Amazon. I’m amazed. I always felt that kindle/prime lending wasn’t that great. You never got the book that you wanted, there were restrictions around one per month..etc. I thought I will stop my prime membership next year since I’m not using prime much and haven’t had a lot of time to view movies or TV series off late. But due to “Prime Reading”, I’ll continue with prime for a long time, I’m sure. It doesn’t have a great collection yet, but I think it will come. Looking forward to a day where I can borrow books from my local library through kindle. I can borrow e-books and read from ‘Overdrive’ app on my phone but still nothing matches the experience of reading from a kindle.\nMy impression of reading this book was that it was very inspiring. It is an easy, fast read, one feels like the author is an inspiring preacher who talks to you from a podium and you’re listening to him with rapt attention. You would love the idea of focusing on one thing, timeblocking (4 hours !) and other practical steps to make life more streamlined. After reading the book, you walk away with a feeling that you’ve gained an insight and will transform your life to follow what was said. Of course, after a few days, you go back to being the old self, being reactive to everything around and multi-tasking and not have time for anything. I think reading the notes again will re-inforce the learning and will slowly change the way you do things.\nHighlights from my Kindle\n”Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.&quot;\n&quot;Success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.&quot;\n&quot;The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it. That’s it.&quot;\n&quot;It takes an average of 66 days to acquire a new habit.&quot;\n&quot;The more we use our mind, the less minding power we have.&quot;\n&quot;The problem with living in the middle is that it prevents you from making extraordinary time commitments to anything.\n”To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. This requires getting extremely out of balance in relation to all other work issues.&quot;\n&quot;When you act on your priority, you’ll automatically go out of balance, giving more time to one thing over another.&quot;\n&quot;A big opportunity is better than a small one, but a small problem is better than a big one.&quot;\n&quot;The good news is that science isn’t about guessing, but rather the art of progressing.&quot;\n&quot;What you build today will either empower or restrict you tomorrow.&quot;\n&quot;Achievement and abundance show up because they’re the natural outcomes of doing the right things with no limits attached.&quot;\n&quot;A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.&quot;\n&quot;Quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question.&quot;\n&quot;Anyone who dreams of an uncommon life eventually discovers there is no choice but to seek an uncommon approach to living it.&quot;\n&quot;Your big ONE Thing is your purpose and your small ONE Thing is the priority you take action on to achieve it.&quot;\n&quot;Our purpose sets our priority and our priority determines the productivity our actions produce.&quot;\n&quot;Connect today to all your tomorrows.&quot;\n&quot;Putting together a life of extraordinary results simply comes down to getting the most out of what you do, when what you do matters.&quot;\n&quot;The people who achieve extraordinary results don’t achieve them by working more hours. They achieve them by getting more done in the hours they work.&quot;\n&quot;When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to.&quot;\n&quot;Actions build on action.

Finally, out of desperation, I went as small as I could possibly go and asked: “What’s the ONE Thing you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?” And the most awesome thing happened. Results went through the roof.\nChapter 2 : The Domino Effect\n\n”Every great change starts like falling dominoes.” ~ BJ Thornton\n\nLet’s line up all the ‘ducks in a row’ is a phrase that my previous manager AH used to use often. It does make sense. When you line up the right things, with one flick, you can start a chain reaction of great things.\nSuccess builds on success. When you see someone who has a lot of knowledge, they learned it over time. When you see someone who has done a lot, they accomplished it over time. The key is ‘over time’.\nChapter 3 : Success Leaves Clues\n\n”It is those who concentrate on but one thing at a time who advance in this world.” ~ Og Mandino\n\nPassion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.\nWhen the author says “The ONE Thing shows up time and again in the lives of the successful because it’s a fundamental truth.”, I’m reminded of the ‘Matthew Effect’ from “Outliers” - ‘To one who has, more will be given ..‘”\nPART 1 : The Lies - They Mislead and Derail Us\nThe Six Lies Between You and Success:\n\nEverything Matters Equally\nMultitasking\nA Disciplined Life\nWillpower Is Always on Will-Call\nA Balanced Life\nBig is Bad\n\nChapter 4.\tEverything Matters Equally\n\n”Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.” —Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nWhen everything feels important, everything seems equal. We become busy-bodies, fully active but not moving towards success. Busyness rarely takes care of business !!\nIn his seminal book Quality Control Handbook, Juran adopted Pareto principle of 20/80 to highlight “vital few and trivial many”. 20% of things that we do has 80% of impact.\nTransform to-do list to ‘success list’. Take 20% of the to-do list to make the success list. Take the 20% of that, iteratively you can reach the ‘one’ most important thing.\nChapter 5.\tMultitasking\n\n”To do two things at once is to do neither.” —Publilius Syrus\n\nMultitasking is a lie. There is a cost to task-switching that most people don’t realize they are paying. Distraction undermines results and you can end up doing nothing well. Also it takes a toll on mind and body.\nChapter 6.\tA Disciplined Life\n\n”It’s one of the most prevalent myths of our culture: self-discipline.” —Leo Babauta\n\nSuccess is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right. ‘Selected discipline’ by channeling the energy to important things is very crucial. It takes an average of 66 days to form a habit. Build one habit at a time and give each habit enough time so that it becomes a routine.\nChapter 7.\tWillpower Is Always on Will-Call\n\n”Odysseus understood how weak willpower actually is when he asked his crew to bind him to the mast while sailing by the seductive Sirens.” —Patricia Cohen\n\nWillpower is alway on-call is a lie. Like the charge of a battery, it goes down with usage. So it is super important to prioritize the right thing to do when willpower is higher.\nWillpower is important. For e.g., the Marshamallow experiment done by Walter Michel at Stanford in the 60s and 70s where kids were given a marshamallow and were told that they could have that now or if they wait for 15 minutes, they could eat two. Kids who exercised willpower and delayed their gratification were found (on average) to be more successful later in life.\nWillpower gets reduced on usage. Another study done at Stanford by Prof Baba Shiv - where he divided undergrad students into 2 groups and asked them to memorize some numbers. The first group had to memorize 2-digit numbers and the second 7-digit numbers. They had to then walk across a hallway, to another room and tell the numbers to someone. On the way, they were offered 2 foods - chocolate cake or fruit salad. Students who were asked to memorize 7-digit numbers were twice as likely to choose chocolate (unhealthy treat) since they had reduced willpower.\nWillpower gets reduced if you don’t eat. Research shows that people who do not eat make roughly twice as many errors than those who do.\nWhen willpower is low, we tend to fallback on default settings or on autopilot. This leads to errors in judgement.\nMany things tax our willpower - Implementing new behaviors, Filtering distractions, Resisting temptation, Suppressing emotion, Restraining aggression, Suppressing impulses, Taking tests, Trying to impress others, Coping with fear, Doing something you don’t enjoy, etc.\nMost important thing to remember is that when it comes to willpower, timing is crucial.\nChapter 8.\tA Balanced Life\n\n”The truth is, balance is bunk. It is an unattainable pipe dream… . The quest for balance between work and life, as we’ve come to think of it, isn’t just a losing proposition; it’s a hurtful, destructive one.” —Keith H. Hammonds\n\nBalanced life is a lie, a myth. The term itself was coined only in the 1980s.\nMagic happens at the extremes. To achieve extraordinary results one must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. That may be work or life. And then counterbalance later to offset it.\nThink about life as two balancing buckets - work life and personal life, each with its own counterbalancing goals and approaches.\nChapter 9.\tBig Is Bad\n\n”We are kept from our goal, not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal.” —Robert Brault\n\nBig is bad is a lie. You should not be afraid of big success and end up sabotaging your own efforts to achieve it. There are a lot of examples of people who went all in and lost everything. And those are used to create fear. So we tend to play it safe.\nNo one knows the ultimate limit of what we can achieve. So it is better to think big, dream big.\nThink big - Act big - Succeed big.\nPART 2 : The Truth – The Simple Path to Productivity\n\n”Be careful how you interpret the world; it is like that.” — Erich Heller\n\nChapter 10.\tThe Focusing Question\n\n”There is an art to clearing away the clutter and focusing on what matters most. It is simple and it is transferable. It just requires the courage to take a different approach.” — George Anders\n\nGreat questions are path to great answers.\n”Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.” - Voltaire\n”A prudent question is one-half of wisdom.” - Sir Francis Bacon\n”The power to question is the basis of all human progress.” - Indira Gandhi\nFocusing Question -\n\n“WHAT’S the one thing I can do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary.”\n\nChapter 11.\tThe Success Habit\n\n”Success is simple. Do what’s right, the right way, at the right time.” —Arnold H. Glasow\n\nThe Focusing Question is the foundational habit to use to achieve great results.\nImportant areas of life\n\nSpiritual Life\nPhysical Health\nPersonal Life\nKey Relationships\nJob\nBusiness\nFinancial Life\n\nLeverage reminders and recruit support to keep your success habit working as powerfully as possible.\nChapter 12.\tThe Path to Great Answers\n\n”People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.” —F. M. Alexander\n\nFour options for framing a Great Question.\nQ4. Small &amp; Specific\nQ3. Small &amp; Broad\nQ2. Big &amp; Broad\nQ1. Big &amp; Specific\nWhen you ask a Great Question, you’re in essence pursuing a great goal.\nThinking big and specific is key to a great question. Think Possibilities and benchmark and trend for the best answer.\nPART 3 : Extraordinary Results - Unlocking the Possibilities Within You\n\n”Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.” — Will Rogers\n\nChapter 13.\tLive with Purpose\n\n”Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.” —George Bernard Shaw\n\nGary goes over Scrooge’s story to illustrate that “our purpose sets our priority and our priority determines the productivity our actions produce”.\nYou cannot seek happiness. It happens in the journey. Discover your big “Why” and do things that bring purpose to your everyday actions.\nChapter 14.\tLive by Priority\n\n”Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now.” —Alan Lakein\n\nPurpose is very important and has the power to shape our lives only in direct proportion to the power of the priority we connect it to. Purpose without priority is powerless.\nFuture purpose should connect to current priority.\nChapter 15.\tLive for Productivity\n\n”Productivity isn’t about being a workhorse, keeping busy or burning the midnight oil… . It’s more about priorities, planning, and fiercely protecting your time.” —Margarita Tartakovsky\n\nExtraordinary results come when you get the most out of what you do.\nTime blocking is key for achieving great productivity.\nTime block 3 things in the following order -\n\nTime block your timeoff.\nTime block your ONE Thing.\nTime block your planningtime.\n\nTo experience extraordinary results, be a ‘maker’ in the morning and a ‘manager’ in the afternoon.\n4 proven ways to battle distractions -\n\nBuild a bunker\nStore provisions\nSweep for mines\nEnlist support\n\nChapter 16.\tThe Three Commitments\n\n”Nobody who ever gave his best regretted it.” —George Halas\n\nMastery can happen only if you commit to be the best.

One step at a time, focusing on the ONE big thing.\nPutting The ONE Thing to Work\n\n”In delay there lies no plenty.” -William Shakespeare\n\nThe key thing to make it work is to develop the habit of asking the ‘Focusing Question’ and keep it up."},"Book-Notes/The-Outliers":{"title":"Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcom Gladwell","links":["People/Authors/Malcom-Gladwell"],"tags":["Leadership","Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Sociology","Psychology"],"content":"Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcom Gladwell\nKey Points\n\nExtraordinary achievers are not simply products of their own talents and hard work, but also beneficiaries of hidden advantages, cultural legacies, and unique opportunities.\nMastery in any field typically requires about 10,000 hours of practice. You also need opportunity for deliberate practice (Bill Gates example).\nBirth dates and historical context can impact success (Canadian hockey players born in Jan).\nYour place of birth and the traditional work of ancestors could have a bearing on how skilled you are at something (Rice farmers in China had to work hard since rice farming is tough.

The world is moving fast and successful companies usually grow much faster than anyone in the company can envision, usually in unanticipated directions. Of course, it is always better to have a messy system that serves customers than a clean system that does not have customers. A road full of potholes can serve the purpose of taking someone from one point to another but it is a toil, harmful for the vehicles and the people, and it only gets worse with time leading to despair. Work has to be joyful and a smooth build and release pipeline should be the last of the worries for engineers.\nWas reminded of this quote from Dave Thomas’s2 talk on “Agile is Dead (Long live Agility)”3 -\n\n“99% of software projects looked like this [picture of revolutionaries with guns], valiant people manning the barricades, do-or-die, mostly die. Chaos, smoke, gunfire, death - that was your average software project, and clearly that’s not sustainable. It’s fun and you get to wear cool uniforms but it’s not sustainable.”\n\nThrough engaging story telling, “The Phoenix Project” takes the reader from visualizing a situation of complete disarray where the company is failiing financially, not able to launch things on time and people are overworked, to seeing an ideal state where everthing, including the unpredictable things, are predictably executed. Most of the situations that the characters go through will evoke a sense of déjà vu for folks who have been active in Software development in the last couple of decades, especially in ‘online consumer’ companies. Many of the situations and dialogues might seem forced and a bit artificial. But overall, it is a good read and recommended reading for most engineers. It is a fast read and almost unputdownable.\nI look back to a time when downloading code from clearcase repository, doing a build and starting the server could take almost a day sometimes. Now everything is so fast that it seems magical. The ability to clone a random repository from github and have it up an running in minutes is nothing short of extraordinary. The story underscores the importance of incredible feeling that one gets when things go smooth everytime and things get done as per expectations.\nInspired from ‘The Goal’4\nFor those who have read The Goal, this book will seem very familiar. In fact, the structure is quite the same and the authors do give credit to “Sensei Goldratt” in a few places. When you read the beginning, you know how it will end but it is the journey that makes it fascinating. I’ve been involved in multiple large scale software migrations, most of them being backend services that handled billions of API calls per day and had huge blast radii. It is usually not the question of what the end goal is but about handling situations that arise during the migration. It is like you’re on one bank of a river and want to get to the other bank. You get on the bridge and realize midway (or earlier) that it is incomplete. You’ve got to figure out how to bridge the gap in the bridge.\nBill Palmer, VP of IT, who is the central character, figures out how to get out of many difficult situations by thinking through questions raised by Dr. Erik, who is similar to the Jonah, the ‘Yoda’ like person from ‘The Goal’. He comes up with the four types of work just by the prodding questions from Dr. Erik. In the same way, Bill graps the concept of Goldratt’s “Theory of Constraints” and works out that a brilliant engineer like Brent who is called for every important thing and is always overworked, is actually one of the bottlenecks. Using TOC, the team identifies bottlenecks in the system and introduces continuous integration and deployement thereby improving the flow of work.\nHere are some concepts from the book.\nThe Four Types of Work\n\nBusiness Projects - Much needed for the business to survive, driven by market forces and business leadership within the company.\nInternal Projects - Also called as “Platform projects”, these are technical in nature and involve upgrades, rearchitectures, patches, etc. The technology landscape is changing so fast that no adopting the right technology can have huge impacts to business deliverables. Say - not having Disaster Recovery (DR) capability and being unavailable for customers, or exposing customer data due to a security breach, could destroy the business.\nChanges - Bug fixes, updates, improvements generated by first two types of work. Changes can be anticipated and handled usina a process like Kanban.\nUnplanned Work - It is invisible force that drags everything else down. If something that is done has to be redone because the implementation was faulty, that is usually not accounted for. The quote at the beginning of this post is said in this context. “Like matter and antimatter, in the presence of unplanned work, all planned work ignites with incandescent fury, incinerating everything around it.” Phew!\n\nThe Three Ways\nAt the end of the novel is a section fully dedicated to explaining the Three Ways in detail. It is taken from the follow-on book ‘The DevOps Handbook’.\n\nThe First Way — Principles of Flow - Continuously improve the flow of work. Make work visible, limit work-in-progress (lean principle), reduce batch sizes, reduce hand-offs, remove bottlenecks and waste.\nThe Second Way — Principles of Feedback - ‘Fail fast’ and build new knowledge fast, move quality closer to the source. Build a strong feedback loop by shortening the bridge between operations (or customer support) and development.\nThe Third Way — Principles of Continuous Learning - Improve daily work and reduce toil, embrace a learning culture, try out new things, learn from failures.\n\nNotable Quotes\n\n”Until code is in production, no value is actually being generated, because it’s merely WIP stuck in the system.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Left unchecked, technical debt will ensure that the only work that gets done is unplanned work!&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Remember, outcomes are what matter — not the process, not controls, or, for that matter, what work you complete.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Features are always a gamble. If you’re lucky, ten percent will get the desired benefits.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;To tell the truth is an act of love. To withhold the truth is an act of hate. Or worse, apathy.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Practice creates habits, and habits create mastery of any process or skill.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;You get what you design for.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Every work center is made up of four things: the machine, the man, the method, and the measures.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;There should be absolutely no way that the Dev and QA environments don’t match the production environment.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;It’s not the upfront capital that kills you, it’s the operations and maintenance on the back end.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;But problems, like dog poop left in the rain, rarely get better just by ignoring them.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;IT is not merely a department. Instead, it’s pervasive, like electricity. It’s a skill, like being able to read or do math.”\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nKim, G., Behr, K., &amp; Spafford, K. (2014).

What I realize is that I got the gist of the story but had missed out on a lot of details that Hardy provides. Nevertheless, I had become a fan of Hardy and ended up reading almost all of his books other than Jude the Obscure. The Mayor of Casterbridge remains my favorite since it kind of resembled a Bollywood movie when I read it.\nHardy was not just a writer who wrote a story. He was a history buff, a traveler, an expert in birds and plants, a biblical scholar, and more importantly, a philosopher who understood human nature very well. I felt that he put in all his knowledge into the book in order to teach, and the story was just a small part of it.\nThere are a lot of references to Greek mythology throughout the novel. References to Artemis, Athena, Prometheus, Scylla and Charybdis, Zeus, Olympus, Tantalus, Ulysses, Aeneas, etc. pop up in many places. Reading these references took me back to a time when I read ‘Purana Kathasagarangal’ a book of stories from Greek mythology.\nAlso, a lot of biblical references are found throughout. Different quotes and references from the Gospels, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Book of Samuel, Judges, etc. are found in different places. Was surprised by references like - comparison of watchman recognizing Ahimaaz’s gait from afar to Mrs. Yeobright recognizing Clym’s gait, Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams to that of Eustacia’s, destruction of Sennacherib’s army, and so on.\nHe refers to history of UK (Guy Fawkes, Mary Queen of Scots) , USA (Virginia, War of Independence), Greece (Alexander the Great), India (there is a reference to Begum and Warren Hastings), and so on.\nDetailed descriptions of birds, places, plants, sometimes using botanical names, references to Darwin, are astounding.\nAlso, there are so many philosophical insights about human nature that it is remarkable and thought provoking. For instance, he says that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity, that a well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer. It made me sit and think. Viewing someone as exceptional or godly is bad for the viewer and the person!\nOverall, it is a great read to understand many things. Though most people would read the book during their college days, I think it is best enjoyed after you have experienced many facets of human life - childhood, adolescence, marriage, children, jobs, after you have read enough history or seen enough movies/documentaries about different cultures in the world.\n\nNotes\nBOOK ONE THE THREE WOMEN\n1 - A Face on Which Time Makes but Little Impression\nMeaning of the title = Egdon heath is the face which has not changed over time.\nThe whole of the first chapter is an intriguing introduction to the landscape that the events in the novel are based on. It is a description of Egdon heath as a powerful force of nature, as nature itself. One can almost visualize the twilight as though one is right there. About the twilight he says, it is the time of the day where when a worker looks up, he might continue to work but when he looks down or around, he might feel like it is getting darker and is time to wind up. Hardy calls the heath as a wasteland that is vast and lonely. It has brown vegetation. But he goes on to say that is has been there since prehistoric times and has been unaltered as the stars above though everything around has changed over time. He contrasts it with the sea that is renewed frequently - ‘distilled by the Sun and kneaded by the moon’! The sea changed, the fields changed, the rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained. He gives an imposing persona to the heath.\n2 - Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble\nMeaning of the title = Reddleman appears with a woman (trouble) on his carriage. An old man who meets them on the way gets to know that there is a woman in the carriage and probably adds to the trouble.\nA old man with a walking stick, wearing an ancient boat-cloak (cloak worn by naval officers) is seen walking alone. He sees a van far away and catches up to it. It was that of a reddleman, a person who sells reddles to the villages. Reddles are red seeds that are used to mark sheep when they are sold in fairs. The trade makes the person who sells red since the pigment spreads on clothes and skin during handling.\nThe reddleman is not much of a talker but since he keeps going to the back of the van to check upon something, the old man inquires and is told that there is a lady. The old man tries to extract more information but cannot. They part ways when the reddleman says that his ponies need to rest.\nIt is getting darker and the reddleman looks towards the horizon and sees a woman near the barrow on top of the mountain. After a short while, she goes away and more people come in.\n3 - The Custom of the Country\nMeaning of the title = Custom of the Country is to light a bonfire on the 5th of Nov.\nThis is a long chapter and there is a good amount of dialogue in it. After the first two chapters ended with no characters being named, here many are introduced.\nThe group that gathered around are children, men and women of the neighboring hamlets and they’ve come to light bonfires. Across the heath, you can see bonfires at different places and they’re doing it to celebrate some custom. Hardy says people have been lighting bonfires since ancient times of the Druids. Even if the reasons change, the custom remains.\n\nTo light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man when, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded throughout Nature. It indicates a spontaneous, Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat that this recurrent season shall bring foul times, cold darkness, misery and death. Black chaos comes, and the fettered gods of the earth say, Let there be light.\n\nThe people around the bonfire include Grandfer Cantle, his son Christian, Timothy Fairway, Humphrey, Sam, Susan Nunsuch, Olly Dowden. Grandfer is quite a jolly person who sings songs and dances. Christian is just over 30 yrs and says that no woman would marry him. The folks are quite superstitious and they say that he lacks virility since there was no moon when he was born. They also say that single sleepers are visited by ghosts.\nThey talk about the marriage of Thomasin Yeobright and Wildeve that was to happen earlier that day. They mean to go to Wildeve’s inn and sing a song later. The marriage was opposed by Thomasin’s aunt openly in the church and later she had agreed. They also mention that Mrs. Yeobright’s son Clym is soon returning and they seem to have an admiration for him. They look at a bonfire a bit faraway that is burning steadily and mention that it might be due to wood being used. They mention that it might be by Eustacia, Captain Vye’s granddaughter. They don’t speak favorably of her.\nThey dance as the fire dies out, Christian gets frightened when reddleman appears who has come towards them asking the way to Mrs. Yeobright’s house. A few minutes after the reddleman leaves, Mrs.Yeobright comes. She takes Olly and goes towards Wildeve’s Inn, The Quite Woman.\n\nPersons with any weight of character carry, like planets, their atmospheres along with them in their orbits.\n\n4 - The Halt on the Turnpike Road\nMeaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright halts to talk to Diggory Venn and finds out the bad news.\nMrs. Yeobright and Olly walk down the hill and when they reach the road Olly goes towards her home and as Mrs. Yeobright is about to enter the Inn, she sees a horse and a van nearby and the reddlemen walking alongside. She goes and talks to him to find out that her neice is no in Wildeve’s Inn but in the carriage, that she did not get married earlier in the day as expected. Thomasin gets down from the carriage, Mrs. Yeobright and she walk toward the Inn to confront Wildeve.\n5 - Perplexity among Honest People\nMeaning of the title = Probably indicates the surprise in the village folk who came to dance and found Thomasin inside and not outside with Wildeve\nShe says that if he promised to marry her, he must do it, otherwise, it would bring great shame to the family. Wildeve explains that it couldn’t happen because of an issue with licence. They had gone to Anglebury to register the marriage but since it was made out for Budmouth, it wasn’t useful in Anglebury. Thomasin tries to defend Wildeve. She says that she was upset and decided to come back by herself and not with Wildeve and that it was not his mistake. Wildeve promises that the marriage will happen in a couple of days.\nIn the mean time, the earlier group of people come to celebrate the wedding. Wildeve asks the Yeobrights to stay in the room while he goes to entertain. He gives them drinks and chats with them. They leave and when he comes back, he finds the Yeobrights to have already left by the open window at the back.\nHe looks outside and sees one bonfire still being lit and knows that it is a sign for him. He goes towards it.\n6 - The Figure against the Sky\nMeaning of the title = Figure against the sky that reddleman saw was Eustacia\nIn the chapter we learn that the old man who had spoken to reddlemen was Eustacia’s grandfather. He had put one-and-one together and informed Eustacia that probably the marriage didn’t happen. She lights the fire to signal Wildeve to come to her thinking that he called of the wedding in the last minute because of her.\nShe has asked Johnny Nunsuch, a boy in the neighborhood to tend to the bonfire and goes once in a while to the barrow to check on Wildeve’s Inn through a telescope and then comes back. She asks the boy if he heard a frog jump on the lake to which he replies no. Her grandfather asks her to come indoors and she says she will. After a while, the boy tells her that he heard a frog jump. She sends him off with a sixpence and we see Wildeve coming over after the boy leaves. He tells her that she does not give him peace with the lighted bonfire that does not die out. She tells that she is upset that he chose Thomasin over her. But that she is glad that he didn’t marry due to his love for her. Wildeve explains that it was no the case and it was due to a licence issue. But they continue to chat about their love for each other. She doesn’t allow him to kiss her though. He leaves and she goes to sleep.\n7 - Queen of Night\nMeaning of the title = Description of Eustacia as a Queen\nThis chapter is a detailed character sketch of Eustacia. She is described as exceptionally beautiful. Her father was a bandmaster in the navy and was lucky to have married the captain’s daughter. Her grandfather was not quite happy about it since he was from a noble family. Other aristocratic roots, comparisons to greek gods are also made. She is also portrayed as a very passionate person who has highly romantic notions in her head.\n\nFidelity in love for fidelity’s sake had less attraction for her than for most women; fidelity because of love’s grip had much. A blaze of love, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same which should last long years.\n\nThough she grew up in Budmouth, she is now at Edgon heath with her grandfather after he dad passed away. She hates being here and is always in expectation of something grand to happen.\n\nTo dwell on a heath without studying its meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue. The subtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia; she only caught its vapours. An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet, a suffering woman a devotee, a pious woman a psalmist, even a giddy woman thoughtful, made a rebellious woman saturnine.\n\n8 - Those Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody\nMeaning of the title = The boy Johnny finds Wildeve and Eustacia together and later stumbles upon Diggory Venn.\nThe boy Johnny Nunsuch is going towards his home happy with the money he got from Eustacia. On the way he gets frightened with something and decides to go back and ask Eustacia to lend a servant to walk back with him. But once he reaches there he finds Eustacia talking to Wildeve and he is caught in what Hardy calls as ‘Scyllaeo-Charybdean’ position (after rock and a whirlpool in greek mythology). He decides to not disturb them, musters courage and goes towards his home.\nOn the way back, he gets frightened of something and slips and falls near Diggory Venn. Venn asks him some questions and finds out about Wildeve meeting with Eustacia.\n9 - Love Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy\nMeaning of the title = Diggory Venn hatches a plan to eavesdrop on Wildeve and Eustacia.\nHardy explains that women used to scare their children by saying ‘the reddleman is coming for you’. He says that ordinary people don’t take up the trade though it is vanishing. Reddlemen are wanderers like gypsies but they look down upon gypsies. Sometimes people take up the reddle trade as a penance after some wrongdoing.\nVenn returns to his van and takes up an old letter to read. It is a letter from Thomasin where she explain why she couldn’t marry him. She does see him that way. Looks like the spurned marriage offer is what made Venn to leave his father’s dairy farming and go into reddle trade. He still cares for Thomasin and is upset and Eustacia and Wildeve are causing pain to her.\nSince the boy had told him that Eustacia and Wildeve had agreed to meet on the Rainbarrow, Venn goes there daily to see if they are.

Pessimism leads to paranoia, which leads to defensiveness, which leads to risk aversion. Optimism sets a different machine in motion.”\n~ From The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company.1  by Bob Iger\n\nThoughts\nIf I could describe the book in one word, it is - Optimism. The book charts the big milestones in Bob Iger’s life mainly focusing on the 45 year career at Disney/ABC.  He faced many challenges as he rose through the ranks and what stood out was the strong belief that every challenge was something that could be overcome, that a disruptive idea was not really a long shot once you got into the details, that when you believe in people you can get extraordinary things done. His bosses believed in him and he believed in the people that worked under him. Huge acquisitions like Pixar (7.8 B), Marvel (~4 B), Lucas films (~$4 B), and 21st Century Fox (over 50 billion dollars) were viewed as deals that were good for the consumers and the companies and not takeovers. There is a remarkable scene in the book where Steve Jobs comes to the board of Disney to pitch the sale of Pixar and even Iger is mesmerized by his impassioned speech. I think no other company could have made the running of a big business as a service to people, especially kids and families like Disney did, except maybe Google. Iger did an excellent job of portraying the positive side of Disney.\nAs a top executive, Iger is humble throughout and it comes across in the narrative. It is an emotional, straight-from-the-gut retelling of life at different stages of his career. He believes in the cause, puts in more effort, has the grit to ride out difficult times, and has a great work ethic. He had great bosses that he looked up to, especially Tom Murphy and Dan Burke who bet on talent and put people at places which would help to blossom their abilities. Also, it is not just about work. He brings in a lot of humanity into the book. He talks about his friends and family and other people that he leans on for support. It was enlightening to see the personal relationship he had with Steve Jobs. He dealt with people as friends. His accounts of the Marvel and Lucas films deals were heartwarming since he describes these as times when he forged friendships with Ike Perlmutter and George Lucas.\nI came across this book in Gates Notes2 and found the review by Bill Gates to be a great endorsement. I was also amazed at the great reviews and thumbs up on Amazon and Goodreads. The book lived up to the expectations and didn’t disappoint at all. Would gladly recommend to anyone who is in need of some inspiration. The other business book in recent times, that I was excited to read based on the excitement of the reviewers was The Goal, which is another great read.\nOf the many life lessons, one thing that stood out for me was the description of how a manager at a big corporation should be.\n\n”Managing your own time and respecting others’ time is one of the most vital things to do as a manager. &quot;\n\n\n&quot;.. in a company like Disney, if you don’t do the work, the people around you detect that right away and their respect for you disappears. You have to be attentive. You often have to sit through meetings that, if given the choice, you might choose not to sit through. You have to learn and absorb. You have to hear out other people’s problems and help find solutions. It’s all part of being a great manager.”\n\nThere are other great life lessons and the best thing is that Iger has condensed all of it as short notes at the end of the book in the Appendix. As always, I took some notes at the end of every chapter but I guess that was not needed since the gist is there in the appendix.\nNotes\nPrologue\n\nThis is probably the best start of any book and clearly shows the challenges that Iger faced. It is 2016. Shanghai Disneyland which took 18 years to build, is in the process of opening up. Nightclub shooing in florida, and the alligator attack of a small boy at Disney happen around that time. He speaks to the boy’s father and in less than half an hour attends a banquet for Disneyland.\nHe has worked for the same company for 45 years - 22 at ABC, 23 at Disney with 14 yrs as CEO.\nSome key pointers -\n\nEven the least eventful days require the ability to constantly adapt, and re-adapt.\nThere are always cries and failures for which you can never be fully prepared.\nThe days are challenging and dynamic, but they’re also a never-ending exercise in compartmentalization.\nTen principles necessary to true leadership\n\nOptimism\nCourage\nFocus\nDecisiveness\nCuriosity\nFairness\nThoughtfulness\nAuthenticity\nThe Relentless Pursuit of Perfection\nIntegrity\n\n\n\n\n\nPart One: Learning\nChapter 1: Starting at the Bottom\n\nHe has always been a person who woke up early and that has helped him throughout his life, to be able to carve out time in the morning to think.\nHe fell in love with books in high school. He credits his dad who had a den lined with shelves of books.\nHe started working at young age. He got a chance to work at ABC through his uncle Bob who met someone while at hospital.\nHe was a fan of Frank Sinatra and the high point was him getting a gold cigarette lighter inscribed ‘Love Sinatra’, which he still has in his possession.\nThe personality of Roone Arlidge loomed large in his life at this point. He learnt a lot from him.\nHe credits Arlidge for instilling the ‘relentless pursuit of perfection’, about creating an environment where one refuses to accept mediocrity.\n\nChapter 2: Betting on Talent\n\nCap Cities, a smaller company acquires ABC. Iger along with others are surprised.\nWith time, Iger grows to respect the new owners - Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. Warren Buffett had called them “probably the greatest two-person combination in management that the world has ever seen or maybe ever will see”.\nCovering Winter Olympics in Calgary was a great opportunity for Iger.\nIger talks highly of Tom and Dan and calls them ‘perfect bosses’. He learnt from them that genuine decency and professional competitiveness weren’t mutually exclusive, that ‘betting on brains’ and giving people the right opportunity to flourish was the best thing to do.\n\nChapter 3: Know What You Don’t Know (and Trust in What You Do)\n\nIger takes up the job as the Head of ABC entertainment and moves to L.A.\nAt the outset he says that he had no clue about how things were done at Hollywood. He also points out that ‘inexperience is no excuse for failure’.\nHe was fully dependent on Stu and Ted. His managers Tom and Dan had full faith in him and that was a huge morale booster and he didn’t feel like the was leaping without a parachute.\nDoogie Howser M.D. was one of the first successes. Then came Twin Peaks which was a huge success. Cop Rock, a musical police drama, was a failure.\nThe key lessons were - Never start negatively, never start small, take big risks and fail sometimes rather than not taking risks at all, be comfortable with failure and own up to failures.\n\nChapter 4: Enter Disney\n\nAvoid getting into the business of manufacturing trombone oil. You may become the greatest trombone oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end, the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year. (Dan Burke)\n\n\nThe quote above is mentioned a few times and it was a like a guidepost to Iger.\nDisney acquires Cap Cities/ABC. For Iger, it didn’t seem like a good career option. He was in line to become the next CEO of ABC and was being asked to run the media division of Disney for at least five years.\nHis wife Willow was very supportive. Tom had a lot of confidence in Iger. He told him that if Iger did well, he could run the bigger company some day.\nHe was expecting to be #2 to Michael Eisner but Eisner got in Ovitz to that position and Iger reported to him. He describes it as an unproductive period.\nOvitz was not a fit to the corporate culture at Disney and the description of that period was a lesson in how to be a good manager and also that when executives fight, it is the team that suffers.\nThe key thing is to ask hard question and take fast decisions when things don’t work out.\n\nChapter 5: Second in Line\n\nAfter Ovitz left Eisner didn’t officially announce a #2, but Iger was running most of the things.\nThe key thing is to focus on the job and do it well rather than focus on the next job and not do the current one well.\nABC entered a downward slide in ratings. Who Wants to be a Millionaire brought in success.\nABC’s 24 hour coverage of the Millennium was a novel idea and a great success. Iger was the boss of his earlier boss Roone Arlidge and appealed to his sense of pride to take up the challenge.\nIger’s vivid description of visiting Arlidge while in hospital was touching.\nEisner tells the board that Iger cannot be CEO and Iger is hurt when he hears that. But he doesn’t quit.\nEisner later makes a proposal for Iger to become President and COO and a member of the Disney board.\n\nChapter 6: Good Things Can Happen\n\nIger describes how Eisner had become a legend as a person who had ‘re-founded’ Disney. He was remarkably creative businessman and is credited for turning Disney into a modern entertainment giant.\nHe learnt a lot from Eisner during this period through his visits to Disney parks and Imagineering. Eisner used to be referred to as an oppressive perfectionist and a micromanager. He was proud of it and would say “Micromanagement is underrated”.\nDisney and Pixar have a deal but Pixar feels it is lopsided. Eisner and Jobs don’t get along well.\n9/11 happens and Disney and ABCs profits and ratings go down.\nRoy Disney becomes critical of Eisner and wants to have him replaced. He launches “Save Disney” campaign.\nComcast tries a takeover bid that fails.\nBoard wants a new CEO and tries to shortlist candidates. Iger is the only internal candidate.\n\nChapter 7: It’s About the Future\n\nIger has many interviews and meetings with the Board and others to convince them of his vision for Disney and to convey that he was the best suited to be CEO at that point.\nHe urges the board to look to the future and not the past. Many times he feels the pressure and also gets frustrated in a meeting at one point.\nScott Miller gives him good advice on how to view it as a campaign, define priorities and pitch the ideas clearly.\nIger defines three key priorities for the company under his leadership -\n\nDevote most of the resources to creation of high-quality content. (reminded of trombone oil quote)\nEmbrace technology - to enable creation of content, to reach consumers.\nBecome a truly global company.\n\n\nIn the end, Iger is named the CEO by the board. He is at home with his wife and kids when he gets to know the news from George Mitchell through phone. Eisner also calls him. He later calls his parents, his old bosses - Tom Murphy and Dan Burke, and Steve Jobs.\n\nPart Two: Leading\nChapter 8: The Power of Respect\n\nIn week 1 of the CEO-in-waiting period, Iger calls his closes advisers and lays out the immediate things to be addressed -\n\nBury the hatchet with Roy Disney.\nTry to salvage the relationship with Pixar and Steve Jobs.\nBegin the process of changing the way Disney made decisions, which consisted of restructuring Strat Planning.\n\n\nBefore he could reach out to Roy Disney, Roy and Stanley Gold sued Disney over Iger’s appointment. Iger talks to Stanley and then to Roy, agrees to make Roy as Director Emiretus in the board. The key take away is to “Not let ego get in the way of making the best possible decision”.\nHe patches up Disney’s relationship with Steve Jobs and even forges a friendship. He is on stage with Jobs during the launch of video ipod.\nHe restructures Strat Planning and the company morale across the board goes up.\n\nChapter 9: Disney-Pixar and a New Path to the Future\n\nWhen Iger starts with the talks of Pixar acquisition, everyone is against for multiple reasons, Jobs will not sell, it is too big a risk to take as a new CEO, etc.\nIn his first board meeting, he makes a presentation of the parade in Disneyland Hong Kong that showed that there were no Disney characters in the last decade. Then pitches the idea of Pixar acquisition.\nHe visits Steve Jobs at Pixar office in Emeryville and is impressed at the campus. They whiteboard the pros and cons.\nMinutes before the deal is announced, Jobs takes Iger into confidence and tells him about his cancer and offers that he could back out if he wanted and put the blame on Jobs. It is a poignant moment and Bill Gates highlights this event in his review. Iger doesn’t backout.\nThe key point was the optimism that Iger had about the future of Disney and Pixar with the deal.\n\nIt could fix Disney animation which was core to the success of Disney since the beginning.\nIt would bring Steve Jobs into the Disney Board.\nIt would bring a lot of technological prowess and a culture of excellence into Disney.\n\n\n\nChapter 10: Marvel and Massive Risks That Make Perfect Sense\n\nIger talks about how he got in touch Ike Perlmutter and the process of acquiring Marvel. Ike is described as a tough-to-reach private person and Iger shows a lot of patience in dealing with him. When Ike is not convinced that the Marvel culture would be changed with the acquisition, Steve Jobs calls him and says that Iger would be true to his word.\nIger talks about a personnel mistake that he made - Rich Ross who was very successful at running Disney channel but failed as the chairman of Disney Studios. He fires Rich and brings in Alan Horn who ends up transforming the division.\nHe gives a lesson on firing people - that it has to be done in person, look the person in the eye, not use anyone else as an excuse, be direct, etc.\nAbout hiring he says “Surround yourself with people who are good, in addition to being good at what they do.” Honesty and Integrity matters a lot.\nLot of people and media criticize Iger for the 4 billion dollar price tag for Marvel but he says time have proven that it was one of the best acquisitions ever.\nHe talks about Black Panther and Captain Marvel which were again discouraged since they didn’t fit the stereotype. But former becomes the fourth highest grossing superhero film of all time, and the latter the tenth, Both earning well over $ 1 billion.\n\nChapter 11: Star Wars\n\nIger attends Steve Jobs’ funeral and mentions about Jobs’ confidence in him during the Pixar deal. Jobs’ wife, Laurene tells Iger the other side of the story and that Steve Jobs really liked him.\nAcquisition of Lucas films was an emotional roller coaster. Iger was patient throughout the process and treated George Lucas with greatest respect at the same time protecting the interests of Disney.\nThey bring in JJ Abrams to direct the first Star Wars movie under Disney and that becomes a huge success.\n\nChapter 12: If You Don’t Innovate, You Die\n\nIger talks about his concern about Disney’s place in the future and the need to adapt to the changes and to launch a streaming service directly to the consumers.\nHe goes through a phase of discussions around buying tech companies. They almost end up buying Twitter but he changes his mind in the last minute.\nThey buy a controlling stake in BAMTech which helps them build Disney+ and ESPN+. It meant taking a profitable section of business and investing into future. Though the books don’t look good in the short run, it is going to be a major success in the future. Stock market rewards Disney for this.\nIger talks about a time when he was thinking about running for President. Rupert Murdoch calls him and asks him about it.\nAfter his meeting with Murdoch, the idea of buying 21st century fox takes hold.\n\nChapter 13: No Price on Integrity &amp; Chapter 14: Core Values\n\nIger visualizes the combined company after Fox acquisition and whiteboards the different operational groups the company would be divided into. He gets his staff onboarded with the idea.\nBut the deal itself takes long to materialize due to Comcast bidding at a higher price, then backing off, then coming back after AT&amp;T merger with Warner Media is approved.\nThough Iger is reluctant to go above 28 price point initially, after the AT&amp;T-Warner deal when Comcast makes a 35 a stock, cash offer to Fox, he raises the bid to $38, and finally gets the deal.\nIt is also a period of turmoil since a few key executives get caught in harassment cases - John Lasseter for unwanted physical contact with women, John Skipper for drug abuse. He removes both from their posts and is left with no one managing Disney Animation and ESPN suddenly.\nAfter the merger with Fox and the presentation to the media about the future prospects with Disney+, Hotstart and others, the response from Wall Street was great with the stock going up 30% in a month.\nHe wraps up by saying that 2019 was going to be his retirement date and it was changed to 2021 due to Fox merger. He mentions that he had great mentors and bosses along the way.\n\n\nBook cover Image Credit: play.google.com/store/books/details\nFootnotes\n\n\nIger, Robert. The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company. United States: Random House Publishing Group, 2019. ↩\n\n\nwww.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Ride-of-a-Lifetime ↩\n\n\n"},"Book-Notes/The-Unicorn-Project":{"title":"The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data by Gene Kim","links":["Book-Notes/The-Phoenix-Project","Book-Notes/The-Goal"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Software-Engineering","Business","Information-Technology"],"content":"The Unicorn Project was a project that was mentioned in The Phoenix Project as an important project that people need time to work on.

This procedure makes good use of the value of the diversity of knowledge and opinion in the group. The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them.”\n“The experiencing self does not have a voice. The remembering self is sometimes wrong, but it is the one that keeps score and governs what we learn from living, and it is the one that makes decisions. What we learn from the past is to maximize the qualities of our future memories, not necessarily of our future experience. This is the tyranny of the remembering self.”\n“Experts who acknowledge the full extent of their ignorance may expect to be replaced by more confident competitors, who are better able to gain the trust of clients. An unbiased appreciation of uncertainty is a cornerstone of rationality–but it is not what people and organizations want.”\n“The idea of mental energy is more than a mere metaphor. The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose.”\n“A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.”\n“Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it”\n“Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.”\n“The psychologist, Paul Rozin, an expert on disgust, observed that a single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of a bowl of cherries, but a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of cockroaches.”\n“Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.”\n“If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do.”\n“The idea that the future is unpredictable is undermined every day by the ease with which the past is explained.”\n“Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.”\n“A general “law of least effort” applies to cognitive as well as physical\nexertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the\nsame goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course\nof action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of\nskill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.”\n“This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.”\n“I have always believed that scientific research is another domain where a form of optimism is essential to success: I have yet to meet a successful scientist who lacks the ability to exaggerate the importance of what he or she is doing, and I believe that someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare successes, the fate of most researchers.”\n“We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events.”\n“The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little.”\n“Money does not buy you happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery.”\n“we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.”\n“The world makes much less sense than you think. The coherence comes mostly from the way your mind works.”\n“You are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in general.”\n“Familiarity breeds liking.”\n“The illusion that we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future.”\n“The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?”\n“The test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact.” ,\n“acquisition of skills requires a regular environment, an adequate opportunity to practice, and rapid and unequivocal feedback about the correctness of thoughts and actions.” ,\n“People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media. Frequently mentioned topics populate the mind even as others slip away from awareness. In turn, what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently on the public’s mind. It is no accident that authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media. Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common” ,\n“We are prone to blame decision makers for good decisions that worked out badly and to give them too little credit for successful moves that appear obvious only after the fact.”\n“We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base rates, exposing ourselves to the planning fallacy. We focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others. Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore prone to an illusion of control. We focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs.”\n“Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.”\n“The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.”"},"Book-Notes/This-Is-How-They-Tell-Me-the-World-Ends":{"title":"This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends - The Cyberweapons Arms Race by Nicole Perlroth","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Cybersecurity","Information-Technology","Geopolitics"],"content":"\n“We were plugging anything we could into the internet, at a rate of 127 devices a second.

Many of the situations are dramatic and unbelievable that one could think that there is no hope. But the truth is there are many more cyber security professionals now than before and there is better understanding of the threats. Also Presidential Directives like PDD-63 (1998), HSPD-7 (2003), PPD-21 (2013), National Security Order on Cybersecurity (2021) and so forth have put significant federal funds towards bolstering security of Critical Infrastructures.

She goes through a series of dramatic events in the last decade or so that were the result of cyber warfare.\n\nShe talks about the 2017 attack in Ukraine which was timed to happen during the Independence Day. Ukraine was a digital test kitchen for Russian hackers and they had been testing since 2014, when the US was busy with violence in Ferguson, ISIS crisis, North Korean hack of Sony, etc.\nRussian hackers had hit Ukraine in Dec 2015 cutting off power for around 6 hours, and again in Dec 2016.\nChinese hackers at the same time were stealing American IP. Former NSA director Keith Alexander, called Chinese cyberespionage the “greatest transfer of wealth in history.”\nIranian hackers brought down servers at Sands casino in Vegas as a retaliation to Sands owner Sheldon Adelson’s public comment about bombing Iran.\nRussian hackers brought down the entire nation of Estonia offline after Estonians dared to move a Soviet-era statue.\nRussian hackers apparently bombarded the Brexit referendum, hacked the American grid, meddled with the 2016 U.S. elections, and the French elections.\nThe US always thought it was far ahead of other countries in the world when it came to cyber skills but b/w 2016 and 2017, the gap b/w the US and other bad-faith nations closed considerably. One reason could be the “Shadow Brokers” who leaked a lot of cyber tools from NSA. Snowden leaked data, the Shadow Brokers leaked the actual code which was more damning.\nAfter getting hold of NSA’s hacking tools, Russian hackers launched an offensive attack against Ukraine (called “NotPetya”), hitting companies like Maersk, Merck, FedEx, Cadbury, etc. By 2019, the total tally of losses was $10B.\n\nPART I: MISSION IMPOSSIBLE\n\n\n\nCloset of Secrets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fucking Salmon\n\n\n\nPART II: THE CAPITALISTS\n\n\n\nThe Cowboy\n\n\n\n\nThe First Broker\n\n\n\n\nZero-Day Charlie\n\n\n\nPART III: THE SPIES\n\n\n\nProject Gunman\n\n\n\n\nThe Godfather\n\n\n\n\nThe Omnivore\n\n\n\n\nThe Rubicon\n\n\n\n\nThe Factory\n\n\n\nPART IV: THE MERCENARIES\n\n\n\nThe Kurd\n\n\n\n\nDirty Business\n\n\n\n\nGuns for Hire\n\n\n\nPART V: THE RESISTANCE\n\n\n\nAurora\n\n\n\n\nBounty Hunters\n\n\n\n\nGoing Dark\n\n\n\nPART VI: THE TWISTER\n\n\n\nCyber Gauchos\n\n\n\n\nPerfect Storm\n\n\n\n\nThe Grid\n\n\n\nPART VII: BOOMERANG\n\n\n\nThe Russians Are Coming\n\n\n\n\nThe Shadow Brokers\n\n\n\n\nThe Attacks\n\n\n\n\nThe Backyard\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nPerlroth, N. (2021). This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race. United Kingdom: Bloomsbury Publishing. ↩\n\n\n"},"Book-Notes/When-Breath-Becomes-Air":{"title":"When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi","links":["Abraham-Verghese"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Biography","Philosophy"],"content":"\n“I would have to learn to live in a different way, seeing death as an imposing itinerant visitor but knowing that even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.”\n~ Paul Kalanithi, When Breath Becomes Air 1\n\nI first read about this book through Gates Notes2, where Bill Gates mentions that the book left him in tears. It has been on my reading list for some time. Glad to have read it this year. It is far from being just a sad story about a person dying. It touches many aspects of human life, as though Paul lived many lives in a short span of 37 years. As a son of parents from different religions, son of immigrants, as someone who experienced competitive city life and outdated education in the suburbs, as someone who lived closely with nature, as an explorer, as a wanderer studying different subjects and earning degrees in literature and medicine, as a neurosurgeon, as a husband, as a father, as a son, as a brother.. he indeed lived a fascinating life. The book is a gift to the world. It was truly altruistic of him to write during his last few months as he was going through extreme physical pain due to Chemotherapy and other treatments for his cancer.\nI was taken aback by the foreword itself. The foreword, written by Abraham Verghese, another man of medicine who is also a writer, was quite touching and memorable. I read it more than twice. He underscores the point that you often get to know a person intimately after the person has passed on. He knew Paul at Stanford and had read a couple of his essays, but he really started getting to know him during his funeral through the stories that people recounted and afterward.\nPart 1 of the book is set in the past - recounting his life from childhood to becoming a neurosurgeon at Stanford. His father was a doctor. He credits his mother for instilling a love of literature in him. Though they moved from New York to Arizona, his mother didn’t want them to be behind in studies. So she made sure her kids read books from the AP list and were on par with students from the best schools in the US, in preparation for SAT and college. I got intrigued to find out what this list was. Googled for it and found that the recommendations are varied. Goodreads has 205 books as recommendations3, The Ultimate AP English Literature Reading List from Albert.io has 404, another list had the top 225, etc. But all these books are quite famous, and I haven’t read all of them. Just imagining someone reading all these books in their teenage years was mind-boggling.\nIt was also good to read about intense schedules, being completely immersed in work, being on call for emergencies, having no time for anything else, and yet finding fulfillment in the work since he viewed it as a calling. It is something that I could relate to. Paul says that most people find jobs that fit their lifestyle.\n\n”Indeed, this is how 99 percent of people select their jobs: pay, work environment, hours. But that’s the point. Putting lifestyle first is how you find a job - not a calling.”\n\nIn Part 2, Paul returns to the day he is diagnosed with cancer. Then it is a detailed account of what he goes through. At one point, it seemed like he would overcome it, but then cancer wins. In between all this, he goes through tough decisions in life - whether to take a job offer in a different state, whether to have a child, etc. The most challenging part of life is being in a state of uncertainty where you’re not able to decide on basic things that are probably much easier for most of the others. NYT book review6 captures this really well -\n\n“..Dr. Kalanithi tries to reinvent himself in various ways with no idea what will happen. He can’t gauge how much strength his body still has until he tests it, and sometimes the consequences are horrific. He no longer knows who he is or what he wants. His whole sense of identity is shaken.”\n\nOverall, it is a great book to reflect upon one’s life. Nuggets of wisdom are peppered throughout the book and there are some great quotes that would make you stop and think. By talking about death, the book talks volumes about life and relationships. Here are some quotes to reflect upon -\n\n“Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;The tricky part of illness is that, as you go through it, your values are constantly changing. You try to figure out what matters to you, and then you keep figuring it out.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Most lives are lived with passivity toward death — it’s something that happens to you and those around you.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Literature not only illuminated another’s experience, it provided, I believed, the richest material for moral reflection.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Those burdens are what make medicine holy and wholly impossible: in taking up another’s cross, one must sometimes get crushed by the weight.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;While all doctors treat diseases, neurosurgeons work in the crucible of identity: every operation on the brain is, by necessity, a manipulation of the substance of our selves.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;All have a notion of what it means to be good, and we can’t live up to it all the time.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Moral duty has weight, things that have weight have gravity.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Suffering can make us callous to the obvious suffering of another.”\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nKalanithi, P. (2017). When Breath Becomes Air. United States: Random House. ↩\n\n\nwww.gatesnotes.com/books/When-Breath-Becomes-Air ↩\n\n\nGoodreads - Books for AP English Literature and Composition courses ↩\n\n\nThe Ultimate AP English Literature Reading List from Albert.io ↩\n\n\nREAD, READ, READ to Prepare for AP Lit Exam ↩\n\n\nNYT Review ↩\n\n\n"},"Book-Notes/Why-We-Sleep":{"title":"Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Psychology","Health"],"content":"Thoughts\nI got to know about this book through Gates Notes1 and a few times on Youtube feed. I’m glad that I finally got a chance to read the book. Of course, almost everyone instinctively knows about the importance of sleep. Most people might have had a first hand experience of the ill effects of lack of sleep after going through a sleepless night and struggling through the next day.\nThis book presents information in such a way that would make one sit and think. One gets to understand that sleep is just not ‘rest’, it is beyond what most people think it is. It defines our personality and is critical for our cognitive ability and creativity. A case could be made that humans have evolved to be the most intelligent species on earth because we make the most use out of our sleep. In comparison to most other animals we sleep less but have more percentage of REM sleep which gives us a huge advantage.\nIf our closest cousins, the orangutans, need to sleep for almost double the time (around 16 hours), in the the last 350,000 yrs, we have evolved to sleep less - a mere 8 hours. May be this is a trend and in another 100,000 years, humans might sleep much lesser and yet be more effective. Once we figure out the exact semantics of what sleep entails, we probably could speeden it up. During the course of history, we have made many natural processes of the body faster. For e.g., take the case of healing of a wound. Body can take care of it and heal slowly but with medication, it is faster. There are so many different aspects of our body that has become much better due to modern science.\nEven if you don’t get a chance to read the entire book, just the first chapter can give you insights about sleep that you can take with you for a lifetime.

It keeps you aware of your nose, your eye, your ear, your tongue, your hand. And, above all, poetry is compacted metaphor or simile. Such metaphors, like Japanese paper flowers, may expand outward into gigantic shapes. Ideas lie everywhere through the poetry books, yet how rarely have I heard short story teachers recommending them for browsing. What poetry? Any poetry that makes your hair stand up along your arms. Don’t force yourself too hard. Take it easy. Over the years you may catch up to, move even with, and pass T. S. Eliot on your way to other pastures. You say you don’t understand Dylan Thomas? Yes, but your ganglion does, and your secret wits, and all your unborn children.

I don’t quite remember who it was, but it was someone happy to see me with a book. That set me thinking.\nIt is great to be in this phase of life where I’m getting time to read and also, write a bit. I hope it lasts. Usually, when things are running smoothly, something happens that throws everything upside down and before long, years would have passed by. Anyway, it feels good to sit back and reminisce.\nChennai Days\nI was in Chennai for less than two years in my life, but from a reading standpoint, it was a tremendous period. Was lucky to be in the same team with 4 people I now refer to as “the philosopher quartet” - JC, MS, AH, and VS. They were well-read and used to discuss books often. VS was a real poet who penned poems in Tamil. Was introduced to Kant, Nietzsche, J Krishnamoorthi, Bertrand Russel, and many authors during this period just by listening to them chat with each other. I believe that it was a stroke of luck that I was even placed in that team as my first job. Specific books that I recall right now are Robert Persig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Hemingway’s Old Man and the Sea recommended by MS, Arthur C Clark &amp; Isaac Asimov novels by AH and Who moved my Cheese and a few other business books by JC. AH gave me Arthur C. Clark’s Rama II as a gift when I left Chennai.\nOther groups of friends were folks outside my team - few people who were in my class during the 3 month orientation where we were given a crash course of CS topics, my roommates, and friends of these people. I developed great admiration for people from TKM and CUSAT (engg colleges in Kerala) due to the interaction with these folks. PS was in my class and was a big Harry Potter fan. She had forwarded a pdf/text of the first book, and I had liked the book a lot. AN was my junior and was from Bangalore. As Bangaloreans were ‘foreigners’ in Chennai, I used to connect with b’lore folks just to chat. He was a big fan of The Lord of The Rings. When we used to meet in the hallways of Elnet/Tidel, he would talk at length about the story and it was pretty entertaining. I’d credit PS and AN for my interest in fantasy novels.\nAnother great influence on my reading during that time was DT. She was PS’s friend and also was in my roommate RV’s team, I think. She was a great fan of English classics. I think I read most of Thomas Hardy’s novels during this period: [[The Return of the Native]], The Mayor of Casterbridge, Far from the Madding Crowd, Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Under the Greenwood Tree. Also remember reading George Eliot - The Mill on the Floss &amp; Silas Marner. I think I read Adam Bede after I came to the US. Her favorite books were Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women and Three Men in a boat by Jerome K Jerome. She introduced me to Somerset Maugham and AJ Cronin. Maugham’s Of Human Bondage and Cronin’s The Keys of the Kingdom were great reads. I read Keys of the Kingdom at a time when I was contemplating becoming a priest.  My goal was to work for a few years, get some personal things taken care of, and get into seminary. I did research a few places but wasn’t sure how to get into. Also was waiting for a ‘sign’ that never came! Erich Segal’s Doctors was another of DTs recommendations. Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code and Leon Uris were my roommate RV’s recommendations. VV was another close friend of mine and he was a big fan of Thoreau. He used to speak at length about Walden.\nWell, at the outset, it seems like I read only the books from people’s recommendations. That is true for the first books of many authors. But usually ended up reading more from the same authors and also did pay it forward by recommending the same with new folks that I met along the way.\nNow that I think of it, I probably could go back to my earliest memories to see what I read when. Most of the books that I’ve read have some person or incident attached to it. It is the question of remembering.\nPrimary School\nOne of the first novels I remember reading is The Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. I got this book as a prize for getting the first rank in 5th std. I remember reading the whole book but not understanding it much. I probably read a few times without understanding, I think. I actually understood the story only after I read an abridged version. Another book that I remember reading during that time is Oliver Twist. My mother probably had to study some of Dickens’ stories in school. She had a high regard for Dickens and her advise was that I stick to reading only biographies or stories by Dickens, and so wasn’t quite happy that I was reading a lot of fiction in high school.\nI do remember reading a lot of Tinkle, Amar Chitra Katha during this time. Probably got them from Krishna or Joe or other friends in the neighborhood. Read Balarama and Balamangalam, mostly with BS. My uncle had a lot of books in Kerala, and when we visited during summer holidays, I used to spend a lot of time reading. Remember reading Ithihyamala (Garland of legends/myths), Greek Purana Kathasagaram (Greek Ancient Stories), and 1001 Arabian Nights. Got really interested in mythology - Indian as well as Greek during this time. Almost all of my mythology reading, in the initial days, were in Malayalam. Can’t believe that I read the stories of Zeus, Ulysses, Achilles, etc. first time in Malayalam.\nAnother group of my readings during primary &amp; high school days were novels from Malayala Manorama weekly. Used to read it stealthily most of the time, though. Josy Vagamattom, Joisy, Ettumanoor Sivakumar, Kottayam Pushpanath were my favorite authors. At least the ones that I remember now after 20 odd years. It used to be serialized, in which only a part of the story would be published every week and most of them always ended on a cliff-hanger at the end. One was left waiting for next Wednesday to come! Josy Vagamattom wrote thrillers which had many fights - I remember Dravidan and a hero named Noble. Not sure if Noble was the hero in Dravidan or it was someone else. Joisy wrote poignant family dramas - I remember Ila pozhiyum shishiram in which a man comes back home from Gulf war after 5 years in captivity and finds that his wife had married his best friend. Ettumanoor Sivakumar was a writer of horror stories that had manthravadam (magic), yakshi (lady vampire), powerful munis and what not! Kottayam Pushpanath wrote detective stories that had a lot of twist and turns.\nHigh School\nHigh school was a different world than what I was exposed to till that point. Most kids were reading Hardy Boys, Secret Seven, Asterix, and a few other books and comics that I’d never heard of. In terms of reading volume, I probably read the maximum during that time. Definitely more than 250 books. Just the Hardy Boys books were probably over 50, may be 100. Read most books of Agatha Christie, Jeffrey Archer, Sidney Sheldon, Robert Ludlum, Harold Robbins, Alistair MacLean, Jack Higgins, Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason) and so on. I think I was mostly reading Hardy boys in the 8th std. and suddenly jumped to reading [[Wilbur Smith]], Harold Robbins, Jack Higgins, etc. in the 9th. Sometimes I read a book a day and rushed through them so fast that I barely remembered anything other than the main plot points. We were also going through a tough time personally and the books were probably a good escape too. All the reading meant that I didn’t study as much as I did during primary school. From someone who used to be upset with anything less than 100/100 in primary school and used to check with my teachers when I got less marks, even half a percent less, I became ok with just getting 90% in high school. But it was also a good transition from memorizing every single word in a text book to understanding high level ideas from books. Jeffrey Archer’s Kane and Abel, Sydney Sheldon’s Rage of Angels, Alistair MacLean’s Guns of Navarone, Robert Ludlum’s Bourne series, were some of the best page turners that I’ve read, then and now. RR was a looming influence and like a guru to me throughout high school. A lot of the books that I read were books that he had read though he was far ahead in terms of vocabulary and comprehending difficult texts. Robert Ludlum and Jeffrey Archer were probably his favorites and mine too. The idea of starting with one of an author and reading through all of his/her books came during this time, I think.\nEngineering\nWhen I think of Engineering days, one book that stands out is Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I can’t recollect how I got the book. It was most probably from Viveknagar library. The curious thing is that the cover and the first couple of pages were not there. The torn book started with ‘Part 1 - Non-Contradiction’ and I thought the name of the book was ‘Non-Contradiction’! As I was studying during the day and taking tuitions for neighborhood kids in the evening and doing homework in the night. So there was not much time to read, but somehow did manage to read.\nI did read many English Classics during the time. Became a member of British Library with RA’s help and we used to visit the library many times. Re-read a few Agatha Christie books, a few Shakespeare books (not the plays but abridged versions which were written as stories). Discovered Antony Trollope while randomly surfing through books. I read a few of his books, but don’t remember any at the moment. I’d read A Tale of Two Cities in the past but read that again and found it to be the best book I’d ever read.\nAlso used to visit the Central library in Cubbon Park during those days. It was very close to UVCE and was the biggest library I had seen in my life. It probably is the largest library in the State even now. I was awestruck with the size every time I visited it. We had a very good library in the College but this was something else. Remember reading books on Kerala history from the library. Didn’t know that Malayalam was a young language and evolved as a result of combination of Tamil and Sanskrit. Also read more about our Church history, Christianity in Kerala, etc. Got a better understanding of Orthodoxy and the beginning of Christianity in Kerala in 52 AD when St. Thomas came. I think the average Orthodox Christian in Kerala knows history quite well due to our faction fight with the Syrian Patriarch. The ‘freedom’ fight has resulted in more awareness, otherwise, numbers could have gone down in every generation, with more of the diaspora moving on to new philosophies or identities.\nA Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking was a book that SN had read and I read it based on his recommendation. We used to have a lot of chat around space time and our place in the world itself. He was a follower of Ramanujacharya’s Dwaita philosophy. There are definitely many more books that I don’t recollect right now.\nWorking Days - India\nWhen CTS recruited us from Campus during 5th semester, there was a hope that the Bangalore office would become big enough. But 9-11 struck and we had to go to Chennai. Couple of years of work in Chennai and then a year or so in Bangalore were great in terms of reading. I already mentioned about Chennai days above. When I rewrite this piece, I’d probably write it in a chronological order. In B’lore, I read a few business and leadership books recommended by AN who was from IIM-A and was super wise. I was lucky that he was sitting next to me since he was not even in our team. AN and GG used to solve the crossword puzzle on the Hindu every day morning. I remember not being able to solve even one in the initial days and then slowly getting a hang of it and really loving it.\nWorking Days - US\nA lot of my time in the US has been this cloud of time where I did nothing other than work. Get up in the morning and immediately check if there were some issues or emails from APAC, work late in the night to deliver projects that had very tough deadlines, etc. In reality, it wasn’t like that every day but it seems like that. I’ve always been nostalgic about my time in India and it has always felt like there was no time.\nBut when I look back at the last decade, I have read many books. Most of my Software Engineering related reading happened in the last 15 years. Reminds me to create a section for Software / Computer Science related books in the Reading List\nI remember reading a lot of poetry in the first couple of years. Was still in touch with friends from Chennai and Bangalore and we used to exchange poems even during Chennai days. Was even writing poems during that time. Emily Dickinson and Elizabeth Browning were my favorite poets I think. Shakespeare’s sonnets were a great read. So were other poets like William Blake, Rudyard Kipling, HW Longfellow, John Donne, Tennyson, Rumi.\nLongfellow’s The Arrow and The Song,  Shakespeare’s Sonnet 18 (Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day), Sonnet 116 (Let me not to the marriage of true minds),  John Donne’s No Man is an Island, Robert Frost’s Stopping by the woods, The Road not taken, and Mending Wall (Good fences make good neighbors), Kipling’s If, Elizabeth Browning’s How do I Love Thee, W.E Henley’s Invictus, William Blake’s The Poison Tree, Wordsworth’s I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud, Konstantinos  Kavafis’s Ithaca are poems that I’d recommend to anyone.\nIn 2007, AK, my wife, and I wrote a book of poems and called it Sycamore Tree. It might have had around 20-25 poems. Not published though. AK has gone ahead and written over 100 poems by now.\nAK is a more prolific reader than I am, and I’ve read many books after she has read them. Susan Cain’s Quiet comes to mind. She loves classics too. She has probably read Jane Eyre five-six times. I read Of Love and Other Demons by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Dear Life by Alice Munro, and a few other books from her list.\nOne of my neighbors suggested reading Jonathan Stroud and I loved the three books in The Bartimaeus Trilogy - The Amulet of Samarkand, The Golem’s Eye and Ptolemy’s Gate. Read Lockwood &amp; Co.: The Screaming Staircase while on a trip to Denver a few years back. It was a great experience. Took me back to the early days of reading Hardy Boys!\nA colleague had recommended Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash. Was astounded by that. Stephenson had pretty much predicted a lot of things way back in the 90s. Need to read more of Stephenson.\nLast two years were good in terms of being exposed to reading and books. MT runs an ‘Authors Series’ in the campus where Authors of books come and talk about their books. Just attending them and getting a gist of the books were great time spent. I have all those books in my bookshelf waiting to be read.\n\nNote - I will probably come back update this since more memories may come back in the future."},"General/Reading-the-Great-Books-and-reflecting-using-chatbots":{"title":"Reading the Great Books and reflecting using chatbots","links":[],"tags":["Great-Books","Reading"],"content":"I recently started reading ‘The Great Books of the Western Civilization’1 after buying the complete set from someone on Craigslist.

It is like things aligned, and some goodness transferred to me.\nOne of my childhood dreams was to own a set of Encyclopedia Brittanica2 or The World Book3, and this comes pretty close to it. It reminds me of a friend from the past, a kindred spirit, who wanted the same. The past seems like chapters in one of the books I read long ago. Can’t imagine the number of people I lost touch with in the tides of time.\nRather than my usual practice of summarizing books on this blog, I wanted to try something new this time. As I read chapters from the books, I’ll take a passage and ask ChatGPT or Bard a question to reflect on the text, to explore the text’s relevance to contemporary issues. This approach allows me to engage with a chatbot like ChatGPT on a daily basis. It also gives me a feeling of being able to discuss the book with someone.\nIf you’re interested in following along, I’ll be publishing these reflections on Substack robinsonraju.substack.com, and you can sign up for the newsletter to receive updates.\nHere is a Youtube video by Benjamin McEvoy. Loved to see his excitement about owning the set.\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World\nGreat Books of the Western World is a series of books originally published in the United States in 1952, by Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc., to present the great books in a 54-volume set. ↩\n\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica ↩\n\n\nThe World Book Encyclopedia: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Book_Encyclopedia ↩\n\n\n"},"Lists/Books---2020-H1":{"title":"Books 2020 H1","links":["posts/books/2020-01-04-factfulness/","posts/books/2020-01-18-21_lessons/","posts/books/2020-04-28-great-mental-models/","posts/books/2020-05-09-life-after-google/","posts/books/2020-06-09-the-goal-goldratt/","posts/books/2020-06-20-zero-trust-networks"],"tags":[],"content":"\nFactfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think\n21 Lessons for the 21st Century\nThe Great Mental Models Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts\nLife After Google: The Fall of Big Data and the Rise of the Blockchain Economy\nThe Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement\nZero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks\n"},"Lists/My-Reading-List":{"title":"My Reading List","links":["General/My-Reading-Journey","Book-Notes/The-Ride-of-a-Lifetime","Book-Notes/How-to-Become-CEO","People/Authors/Peter-Drucker","People/Authors/Jim-Collins","Book-Notes/The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People","Stephen-Covey","Book-Notes/The-ONE-Thing","Gary-Keller","Book-Notes/The-Checklist-Manifesto","Atul-Gawande","books/2016-12-15-blink/","books/2016-07-10-outliers/","books/2021-08-07-beyond-order/","books/2020-04-28-great-mental-models/","Book-Notes/The-Bartimaeus-Trilogy","Book-Notes/The-King's-General","Book-Notes/My-Cousin-Rachel","Book-Notes/Makar-Chudra","books/of-love-and-other-demons/","Book-Notes/Fermat's-Last-Theorem"],"tags":[],"content":"Last Updated - 06/06/2020\nList of books that I have read, re-read, started to read, heard a lot about and want to read.

Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan ‘Press On’ has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.”\n~ Calvin Coolidge\n”Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it.

When you race him, he will win.”\n~ Tom Fleming\n”A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.”\n~ Anonymous\n”When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.\nOnce you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”\n~ Steve Jobs\n”If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.”\n~ Bruce Lee\n”People often become what they believe themselves to be.
