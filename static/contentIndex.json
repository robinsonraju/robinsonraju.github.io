{"About-Me":{"slug":"About-Me","filePath":"About Me.md","title":"About","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Who am I?\nI view myself as a thinker and a teacher. I love to ask big questions about life and the universe and try to find my own answers or relate to books and movies. I constantly have the feeling that there is much to learn, and I’ve only scratched the surface. I am an optimist. I believe in serendipity. Surprisingly blissful things have happened in my life when I least expected them.\nI think life throws similar scenarios at us so that we get a chance to do better next time. Everything - days, months, years, birthdays, anniversaries, festivals - happen in cycles, and we get to relive similar moments as wiser people with time. People that we’re meant to deal with - friends or foes, keep coming in and out of our orbit even when we don’t expect because we still have things to share and learn together.\nI’m grateful for having been surrounded by people and places that brought out the best in me. If you knew me many years back and find me changed with better abilities and more knowledge than before, thank the people I’ve had the chance to be with. I also feel fortunate for being alive at this point in time in the history of mankind. It is arguably the best era so far.\nWhat do I do?\nI’m a Software Professional working in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States.\nI’ve been fortunate to get multiple opportunities to work on mission-critical systems in the past couple of decades which I’ve spent building systems at scale - systems that processed billions of records, web pages that got over 100 million hits per day, APIs that had over a couple of billion calls per day, systems that handled monetary transactions of millions of users and so forth. I’ve worked both as a backend engineer and engineering manager. However, the past decade has been mostly in Engineering Leadership.\nI’m drawn towards projects that are challenging and have tough timelines. I’ve worked on projects that were new ideas and huge re-architecture projects of legacy systems. I love the responsibility that comes with the ownership of a system that is 24/7 and the quick-thinking that is needed to resolve ad-hoc issues that impact customers. I’ve enjoyed working in small, close-knit teams that focused on achieving a large singular goal. I like to streamline things - be it modularizing codebases, or organizing teams to reduce ambiguity.\nMy career has mostly been on e-commerce, payment systems and cybersecurity. I love to learn new things and read books on a variety of topics. I also love to teach and believe that to be my natural talent, with everything else being acquired over the course of my life. I always welcome any opportunity to teach on the side if time permits and hope to do more of it at a later stage.\nHobbies\nOther than software development, I love traveling - mainly to historic landmarks, reading (poetry, classics, sci-fi, technical and semi-technical books). I also love walking long distances and hiking. I’ve run a few half marathons and am looking forward to running a full sometime in the future.\nWriting\nThis website is a collection of my writings on several topics, ranging from books read, places traveled, technologies learnt, and some notes on software. I’ve thought whether I should focus on just one topic - say notes on books read, or on places traveled. Or whether the site should be a professional portfolio. But I’ve decided against those and write the thoughts as-is like I’m talking to a friend. So, all the opinions are like casual conversations.\nAlso, I write everything with the view that it is a draft that I could come back and modify later. I do go back and edit posts when I can. That is one reason for calling the site as ‘Notes’, hoping that with time, it could become PKM system with interconnected links.\nWebsite\nThe current site is a static site generated using Hugo. The site has taken different shapes over the years. The content has been in Blogger, Wordpress, Google Sites, etc. So the site is also an avenue to try some new technology for me.\nIterations\n\nBlogger (2005)\nGoogle Sites (~2008)\nWordpress (2013)\nJekyll with Github pages (2017) - Clean blog theme.\nHugo with Github pages (2020) - Anatole , Aurora, Paperesque, Even, Diary, zzothemes.\nQuartz with Github pages (2024)\n\nWhy not Blogger, Wordpress, etc. ?\n\nA static site is faster.\nI don’t intend to run ads or do any kind of tracking.\nMany of the platforms may have a fine print that says they own the content.\nEasier to migrate to new themes or platforms.\nI don’t need the bells and whistles of a CMS platform yet.\nEasier to write using markdown.\n\nDisclaimer\nThe thoughts and notes on the site are mine and do not reflect any of my employers or friends."},"Blog/2005/2005-06-07---here-cometh-the-time-to-blog":{"slug":"Blog/2005/2005-06-07---here-cometh-the-time-to-blog","filePath":"Blog/2005/2005-06-07 - here cometh the time to blog.md","title":"here cometh the time to blog","links":[],"tags":["blog"],"content":"everyone seems to be blogging.\nis that why i want to blog ? nopes . i have this strong tendency to go retro from the direction that the crowd is going . so thats not the reason. anyway , let me make my tendencies a subject of another post.\nback to why i thought of blogging , i am freeeeeeeeeeeeeee\nso totally free that i need to just come to the office , drink coffee , have lunch , drink coffee again and then rush home . well ! somewhere in the middle , i stuff in a task called “check mails” .\nmoreover, i always wanted to ‘write’ something.\nnow that i have time and have done the great thing of starting to put pen on paper (ePen on ePaper rather) , i guess words will flow ."},"Blog/2005/2005-06-10---about-not-wanting-to-buy-so-many-books":{"slug":"Blog/2005/2005-06-10---about-not-wanting-to-buy-so-many-books","filePath":"Blog/2005/2005-06-10 - about not wanting to buy so many books.md","title":"about not wanting to buy so many books","links":[],"tags":["blog"],"content":"Much as I want to buy as many books as I want , I don’t like being forced into book-buying , to feel that I’ve done something which I could’ve avoided.

What if I get so busy that I cannot come here? Moreover I’m getting a discount here” … mind always finds some reason. Only after I leave the book shop would the impact hit me ; that my pockets just got shallower.\nThe latest book-buying was just a couple of weeks back. Had gone there to meet a friend. Saw Blossoms. Thought , ‘I anyway have another 30 mins to go. lemme check out the books. just see not buy.’ Went in and immediately remembered my friend telling me about “The King’s General” by Daphne du Maurier.

It’s as pacy as a modern day thriller. Reminds me of Gone with the Wind though. It is about Richard Grenvile, the king’s General in the west, the bravest amongst the brave, the lion of the times, the king’s darling, the rebels’ dread and about the only woman in the world he cared for : Honor Harris – a beautiful lady who was crippled just a day before their marriage in a tragic accident.\nThe novel is a first person narrative by Honor and from the time it starts with her brother Kit’s marriage to Gartred Grenvile, events unfurl one after another so quickly that within no time you would find yourself in Menabilly amidst a raging civil war between the forces of the King and the Parliament, pausing probably in the middle during the accident which cripples Honor, more due to shock than because the story slackens in pace there.\n\nHeader Image - “The Cornish coast at Menabilly” by Matt Buck via Flickr"},"Blog/2005/2005-06-15---Makar-Chudra":{"slug":"Blog/2005/2005-06-15---Makar-Chudra","filePath":"Blog/2005/2005-06-15 - Makar Chudra.md","title":"Makar Chudra by Maxim Gorky","links":[],"tags":["Fiction","Short-Stories","book-notes","blog"],"content":"{{&lt; img src=“/images/img/general/blog4_steppe.jpg” width=“100%”&gt;}}\n\nThe story starts with Makar , an aged gypsy conversing with the author. It is dark , the wind is heavy , the campfire is blazing furiously ..yet Makar , smoking his huge pipe , was unfazed. It was as though these heavy conditions never affected him.(reminds me of Vikram-Betal stories of chandamama ! it was dark , the night was heavy , yet Vikram was unfazed. He climbed the tree , pulled the corpse out . as he started walking away with it , the corpse on his shoulder came to life !!!) .\nMakar is of the opinion that people are born to travel; that there is nothing better than traveling. “A curious lot people are ; they herd together trampling on each other when there is so much of space-” . he asks why a man should be ploughing a field . “A man who ploughs land pours his strength into the land. He not only loses his strength but also his freedom. He is tied to the soil. I have traveled so much , seen so much and learnt so much that you would require a 1000 bags of paper to put them all in.”\nWait , wait ! what’s happening ? is this the story of an old gypsy and his philosophy ? dear pal , it certainly is not. who , in reality is he in the story ? No one. He is less significant that the phone operator in my office who connects me to some important person outside whom I wish to speak to . The story belongs to the fearless youth Loiko Zobar or does it belong to the beautiful but vicious Radda ? Let us pace towards them.\nThe talk stops when they hear Nonka , Makar’s daughter singing. The author looks at her and is fascinated by her beauty. Makar says “you would like to have a beautiful maid like her to fall in love with you . wouldn’t you ? No good for you. Put no faith in women. Once you kiss one , all your freedom is gone. You will come to ruins. Let me tell you a story -”\nLoiko Zobar was a fearless youth who was famous across the whole of steppes. If he ever took fancy to something , it was his . He traveled hither and tither as he pleased. There were at least 10 men in each village who had sworn to take his head. But they couldn’t even touch a hair on his head. It was said that he could even knife the devil if he came in his way.\n“His moustaches swept down his shoulders , where they mingled with his hair; his eyes shone like two bright stars, and his smile was sun itself. ..When he looked into your eyes, your soul surrendered to him, and instead of being ashamed of this, you were proud of it. You seemed to always become better in his presence.”\n(Though I see Richard Grenvile in every brave man whom I read of , if I were to write about Richard , the description would match the one above – word to word.)\nRadda was the queen among beauties. A man could not but be rooted to the place where he stood if he saw her. “No words could ever describe Radda’s beauty. Perhaps it could be played on a violin , but only by one who knew the instrument as he knew his soul.”\nMany many men asked for her hand but she refused. A rich man was so dumbstruck with her beauty that he was ready to give away everything for her sake. But she was too haughty. To the rich man her reply was “if the eagle’s mate went into the nest of a crow of her own will, what would you think of her ? ”. Likewise she mocked at everyone who asked her hand.\nIn one of his travels , Zobar chanced to come to the camp that Radda was in.\n….\nAt once smitten by Radda’s beauty he tries to woo her. But she finds his talk humourless, finds his music bland, she doesn’t in anyway relent to him. Zobar plunges into deep despair and is seen playing his fiddle throughout the night. He is so brilliant with the fiddle, that his music melts everyone’s heart.\n“You felt that tune with every fibre of your body, and you became a slave of it. And if at that moment Zobar had called out ‘out with your knives, comrades’, every man would have bared his knife against anyone he pointed out. He could wind a person with his little finger, but everyone loved him dearly”. Such was Zobar’s effect on all. Yet Radda would have nothing at all of it. She mocked him continuously. While all others appreciated every song that he sang, she vehemently criticised them.\nNot finding a way to make her approve of him directly, Zobar approaches Danilo, Radda’s father. Danilo approves; says “Take her if you can” . Radda is seen sitting on a horse and Zobar approaches her. He says he has seen many a woman but none as fiery and beautiful as her. He asks her to be his wife but warns her that being his wife doesn’t mean that she would be able to curb his freedom. In reply she lashes her whip at him. The whip catches his feet and pulls him down. He falls on the ground on the back of his head. Radda has a wild grin on her face.\nAs he limps away Radda dismounts from the horse and comes towards him. As soon as she is near him, Zobar goes for his knife, Radda pulls her pistol out. She tells him that she is ready for truce, that she finds him the bravest man in the whole of steppe, the only one who could ever stand up to her. She presents a proposition before him . If she has to be his wife he has to touch her feet in front of every one around and then kiss her hand. She tells him that her passionate kisses and caresses are just waiting for him. Under their effect he will forget the brave life he led in the past and be a servant of her for ever.\nEveryone finds it distasteful that Zobar has to touch her feet. Zobar says nothing, he goes away. He is seen thinking the whole night, sometimes playing sad tones with his fiddle in the night .\nThe next day comes . Zobar tells his comrades that he will touch her feet but he needed to test how strong her heart was. Zobar walks towards Radda , goes close to her and plunges his knife into her heart. She pulls the knife out and moments before life went out of her she said “Farewell Zobar. I knew you would do it”. As the stunned crowd sees a lifeless Radda fall down, Zobar throws himself on her feet. Moments later everyone is still silent as Zobar gets up and starts to walk away. It was then that Danilo Rushes towards Zobar and thrusts his knife to the back of his heart. Zobar falls.\nThe image of Radda and Zobar lying dead keeps circling in the author’s mind, but Makar continues smoking his huge cigar.\n\nHeader Image - “The steppe” by Alan Fieldus via Flickr"},"Blog/2005/2005-06-17---My-Cousin-Rachel":{"slug":"Blog/2005/2005-06-17---My-Cousin-Rachel","filePath":"Blog/2005/2005-06-17 - My Cousin Rachel.md","title":"My Cousin Rachel by Daphne du Maurier","links":[],"tags":["Fiction","Romance","Historical","book-notes","blog"],"content":"{{&lt; img src=“/images/img/general/blog6_cornwall.jpg” width=“100%”&gt;}}\n\n6/17\nIt was Krishna’s wedding. Krishna, my closest pal during childhood; my first best friend (first best friend !! does that sound strange ? well ! at different times in life I had different best friends. Guys with whom I had nothing to hide and who hid nothing from me. My brothers.) All day I was wondering what to give. He generally was fond of things carved out of glass. The only doubt was whether he still liked showpieces . well, I thought I’d go to the shop and decide. Brigades was on the way. I decided to put at stop at Archies there to choose a gift. As always there was no place to park. Went downwards alng Church Street looking for a space. Drove, drove and drove .. finally found a place to park. Turned around to see something that I would always love to see. Blossoms. Something was going on. Was it being renovated ? No, this was the newly furnished ground floor and was still being filled with books. I went to the first floor – straight to the du Maurier section. Eyes sought ‘My cousin Rachel’ . There it was – a greenish book with a lady draped in a green shawl looking directly at me. Behind her was a house, a villa. The villa was a bit far off. Between the villa and her one could see a lot of greenery. Trees all around and a well maintained lawn.\nI turned the book and started with what was written on the back cover (I hate reading whatever is written in the back cover. I feel it somehow gives away the author, somehow cheats me, somehow doesn’t give me the right to let the events unwind in my mind since I start expecting things to happen. My best readings have come from books of which I hadn’t read an introduction, of which I knew nothing, expected nothing. I don’t know how many of you like to see movie trailers or would enjoy the movie after you have been told the story.) Anyway, the crime was committed. I read it in a single go ..\n“Ambrose married Rachel and never returned home. His letters to his cousin hinted that he was being poisoned and when Philip arrived in Italy, Ambrose was dead…”\nI’ll put a stop to Gorky and start with du Maurier.\n..\n6/20\nIt’s a flashback. Philip’s flashback. It’s about him recounting the events that haunt him. Philip ? Philip in ‘The Mill on the floss’ had a hunchback, Philip in ‘Of Human Bondage’ had a clubfoot, what disadvantage does this Philip have ? None? He is orphaned, yes, but none with his physique, something with the psyche though.\nWhen the narrative starts with Tom Jenkyn’s hanging that he had witnessed in his childhood, you wonder why he is telling about it and as you go further, you tend to dismiss it as some bad happening that he had witnessed as a kid.\nHaving lost his parents at a very young age he was brought up by Ambrose, his cousin. Ambrose was everything to Philip, He was Philip’s father, mother, guardian, teacher, role model – all in one. Ambrose is unmarried, is very passionate about garden, always trying to gather some rare shrub to plant.\nThe story starts with a middle aged Ambrose not being able to withstand winters in England. He is advised to go to a hotter place and this time Ambrose decides to go to Italy. From Italy he writes to Philip often. In one of his letters he mentions about meeting a distant cousin of theirs, cousin Rachel. In the next few letters he is all words about Rachel, describing her interest in gardening and trees. The letter after that comes with the news of him being married to Rachel. This is a shock to Philip and he feels as though someone has taken Ambrose away from him. But he conveys the news to his neighbours who are really happy upon hearing the news. The letters from Ambrose stop coming. After a long time, Philip gets a very short letter from Ambrose, in illegible handwriting , hinting that his wife is trying to kill him. Philip gets alarmed, speaks to his godfather Nick Kendal, who says Ambrose might not be well and that he might have tumour in the head that his father had.\nPhilip sets out to Italy.\n..\n6/21\nOn the way he gets a mail from Ambrose asking him to leave to Italy immediately. With great difficulty he get to Florence and when he reaches the Sangaletti villa, he is informed that Ambrose is dead. Philip is almost devastated and inconsolable. He could not even imagine that he would never see Ambrose again. He comes to know that Rachel has left the place taking away all of Ambrose’s possessions except for a hat. Philip takes the hat and sets out to meet Rachel’s friend Rainaldi. Rainaldi is a matter-of-fact businesslike person and Philip takes an immediate dislike for him.\nPhilip sets back to England. After a few months, he is called by his godfather Nick who tells him about a mail from Rachel. Rachel was planning to come to visit them.\n\nHeader Image - “Cornwall England” by barnyz via Flickr"},"Blog/2006/2006-01-23---All-charged-up-for-nothing":{"slug":"Blog/2006/2006-01-23---All-charged-up-for-nothing","filePath":"Blog/2006/2006-01-23 - All charged up for nothing.md","title":"All charged up for nothing","links":[],"tags":["blog"],"content":"Ever started your day in the office with a rude shock?

If I were a man of action I’d be benumbed for a second, taken aback by the momentary loss of sense before coming to terms with things around.

On the way I think – ‘anyway I’ve got up. Let me take a leak’. 100 out of 100 times I meet up with a few friends in the restroom. We come out of it, talk this and that and head to the pantry.

If you have competence in that field, you must have done something similar. You must have read about something on similar lines.\nSome time back RV had told me what he had learnt in some programme that he had attended - about different levels of competence. There are 4 levels of competence\n\nUnconscious Incompetence\nConscious Incompetence\nConscious Competence\nUnconscious Competence\n\nYou are in the first stage if you don’t know that you don’t know. The second stage is when you know that you don’t know. The third is when you know that you know. The fourth when you, after having transcended the knowing stage, aren’t even aware that you know. For instance, when you become very adept at driving, you can do it skillfully without even concentrating on it. Is it possible that you have qualities that put you in level 4 directly with regards to doing things ? That you are gifted from birth ? \nNah ! you gotta work for it. Only experience can get you to level 4 when you can perform the magic of doing a task in 2 hours which a CC would take 3 days, CI couple of weeks and a UI cannot hope to do.\n\nHe doesn’t remember why they were on the dark unlit road. But there he was.. listening to R as he was walking. R’s words sound so clear even today - “When a master does something, it appears as magic to you.

Excellence in speech seemed natural to him.\nThey keep talking..\nSuddenly he realizes that it is too late. He has to get home. They run towards the bus stand and he manages to catch the last bus to Thiruvanmiyur in the nick of time. Things are so calm and quite in the bus.

Sometime later he looks into his bag. It is heavy. R had given him a lot of books. ‘Take how many ever you want’, R had said. There were 2 boxes full of books. He had taken around 8 or 10.

But luckily C had arranged for everything and we just had to go to the table where he and other team members were sitting. But I wondered.. why so many? what do they sell here? why so many people? The restaurant was a huge circular hall and it looked same from all sides. Seemed as though there were circular tables all over and the same group of people sitting around every table. I looked again .. and again. They looked so alike. It is difficult to tell one Chinese from another and the big crowd in front gave the impression of 100s of duplicates sitting next to each other and chattering.

When it came to philosophy, about the purpose of life, the meaning of life and things around, there was none better than SN. It sometimes seemed to him as though SN had a complete grasp of the whole universe. There were so many things that SN seemed to know. Those days SN was learning Sanskrit in his spare time.None could fathom SN’s knowledge from outside. SN came across as jolly-jovial-loved-by-all chap. SN was very clear in his speech. Very lucid. One would never miss a point when SN spoke. SN never hurried.\nOnce SN had come to his home. The moment they saw him, his mother and sisters had exclaimed. ‘Oh ! he looks so alike you’, they told him. SN’s parents too were surprised at the similarity. Those days a stranger might easily have taken them for brothers.\nHe later looked at himself in the mirror. He was never one to bother much about the way he looked. So he couldn’t tell if he had changed or not! But he found that he spoke slower that he used to. Words were not gushing out of his mouth anymore. They were coming out slowly, purposefully. They soothed him and those whom he spoke with."},"Blog/2006/2006-02-08---The-Storyteller's-Creed":{"slug":"Blog/2006/2006-02-08---The-Storyteller's-Creed","filePath":"Blog/2006/2006-02-08 - The Storyteller's Creed.md","title":"The Storyteller's Creed","links":["All-I-really-need-to-know-I-learned-in-kindergarten’","General-Notes/People/Friends/DT"],"tags":["blog"],"content":"\nI believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge.\nThat myth is more potent than history.\nThat dreams are more powerful than facts.\nThat hope always triumphs over experience.\nThat laughter is the only cure for grief.\nAnd I believe that love is stronger than death.\n\nThis is from a book named All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten’.

I’d watched it till Maria stealthily ran away to the abbey. DT had said it was the best of movies ! must-watch-should-not-be-missed kind of movie. It is a musical about a wannabe nun being a governess in a Captains house (palace!) gaining the confidence of his 7 kids. It’s a classic. It’s a jolly ride, I’d say – jolly roller coaster musical flow in and out of good times.\nBy the time I finished everyone was awake.. \nNC, reading paper – “They’ve opened a new park near downtown. Let’s go.” \nMe – “Yup..I anyway needed to go to the library.” \nNC – “ok. We’ll cook something, take it and eat it from there.”\nMe – “We’ll eat here and then go there. I don’t like to eat in open spaces.”\nNC – “It’ll be cool to eat in the park. It’ll be like a picnic. We’ll eat there.”\nMay be because I’ve seen too many parks littered with leftovers .. I don’t like to eat in parks. Aren’t parks meant to be .. I don’t know .. heaven-in-the-middle-of-rubble or something ? a serene place ? a place where you just sat silently or walked slowly or.. whatever.. well ! it’s my personal prob. I’d rather not impose my ideas into someone else.\nI went to the library .. and to my surprise saw that there was a book sale going on there. Bought some books. That kind of put me back into good spirits. Called up NC to find out if he was coming to the park. He was ready. We found the park, sat on the green grass.. Using bag as pillow I lay flat on the grass and started reading ‘message in a bottle’. \nNC unpacked and had his lunch. \nAfter a while he turned towards me .. \n“How was the sale ? what did you buy ?”\n“Not many .. arnd 5.”\nNC inspected . he put aside duMaurier - Frenchman’s Creek , Life of Pi …and other books.

Over a span of 3 centuries, thousands of brilliant and hardworking men and women were at it.. and in the quest had discovered so many ground-breaking theories ..even new branches of Maths!\nI was just dumbfounded the moment I read it - at the sheer truth behind it. Here it goes ..\n\n&quot;Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. You go into the first room and it&#039;s dark, completely dark. You stumble around, bumping into the furniture. Gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture is. And finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch and turn it on. Suddenly, it&#039;s all illuminated and you can see exactly where you were. Then you enter the next room . . . &quot;\nExactly !! I think this applies to most situations in life! \nI’ve been in this groping-in-the-dark-what-do-I-do-next state so many times !\nMay be that’s the joy of teaching.. you see someone groping in the dark and help him/her to the switch and when the room lightens up .. the look on the bright face..that look is the bliss of teaching. And vice versa.. anyone’d be really happy to be with a person who ‘knows’!\nThere are so many mathematicians mentioned in the book.. Euler.. Gauss .. Galois .. Sophie Germain .. I can see them all..as though they spent their lives on earth just recently. \nWhatever was written about Gauss in the book, I already knew.. even the story of his teacher giving the 7 yr old Gauss with a difficult monotonous problem like 1+2+3+..100 as punishment and him solving it in a couple of minutes ! \nGalois was a revelation .. I was reminded of Marlowe.\nA really bright star who came in, brightened the whole sky with brilliant blinding light , then swiftly disappeared.\nHe was so brilliant that he could solve most equations in his mind. In fact he couldn’t get into the most famous college at that time because he wrote the answers directly without intermediate steps. While still a schoolboy, he’d learnt all the higher level mathematical theories extant at that time and had developed the theory in his name – the Galois theory !\nGalois died in a political duel. The night before the duel.. he was so convinced he would die, that he wrote down his complete mathematical theory and sent it to his friend. At the time of his death, he was just 20!\n\nHeader Image - “Maison Fermat” by Karine C. via Flickr."},"Blog/2006/2006-07-05---The-destruction-of-Sennacherib":{"slug":"Blog/2006/2006-07-05---The-destruction-of-Sennacherib","filePath":"Blog/2006/2006-07-05 - The destruction of Sennacherib.md","title":"The destruction of Sennacherib","links":[],"tags":["blog"],"content":"Some days you get up slowly ..\nsit or sometimes sit n sleep on the bed for sometime ..\nwait for thoughts to gather, slowly come into terms with the world – as though you need time to gradually transition from one world to completely different one – as though you just came out of water and you’re gasping for breath.\nYet, Some other days you get up with a jerk – immediately springing into action – as though the very reason that you got up was to do that . It’s as though you’ve been awake all along but had just closed your eyes temporarily..\nToday was one of those ‘some other’ days.\nIt was a holiday but I just got up and immediately wanted to check out ‘the destruction of Sennacherib’. I wanted to read the Biblical passage which mentioned this incident.\nThis out-of-ordinary behavior was because just yesterday I started with this book named “Familiar Poems, Annotated” by Asimov.\nFor starters, Isaac Asimov was a master science fiction writer, the most famous in his time and the best of them all. He was a child prodigy who started writing books at the age of 7 and has written books on almost topics .. even Bible &amp; Shakespeare.\n“Familiar Poems..” is not just another compilation of poems. It is a glimpse into the times.. into history. The poems are arranged chronologically. After each poem he gives a backdrop.. So when you read the poem, read the description and once again read the poem, you don’t see beautiful words strung brilliantly to produce rhythm and rhyme but the play .. the actual scene being enacted right in front of your eyes.\n“The destruction ..” was the second poem , Ozymandias being the first.\nSo I got up ..\nreached under the cot for the laptop &amp; specs..\ngoogled..\n2 Kings Ch 18 &amp; 19. \nThe Bible says 18,500 people were dead .\n&quot;Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,\nThat host with their banners at sunset were seen:\nLike the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,\nThat host on the morrow lay withered and strown.\n\nFor the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,\nAnd breathed in the face of the foe as he passed:\nAnd the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,\nAnd their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still! &quot;\n\nI finished reading it .. also read the wikipedia article about it. It said that the biblical account was one sided and actually Judah had lost to the Assyrian King. Whatever !\nCame out of the room and found that T and his friends were almost ready .. his friends had come from different places in the US to visit the west coast and he was kind of taking them around. They were going to San Francisco today.\nSince I’m a sleep-early (actually sleep-more) kind of a chap, and they came over pretty late, I never got to speak to them. Thought I’d get acquainted in the morning and now they were about to leave..\nTheir departure set me thinking .. Did they eat anything in the morning? Gosh ! May be I should’ve asked them if they wanted to have something ! Frozen Idiappam ?\nNah ! People brought up in Kerala usually don’t brighten up so much when they hear ‘idiappam’/ ‘kappa’ / ‘aluva’ ..etc in comparison to those brought up outside.. Well! there was nothing much to eat anyway !\nWhen you’re staying as a bachelor and when friends’s friends usually drop in .. you kind of lose the host-guest feeling .. You’d slowly tend to stop worrying about such things.. bachelorhood..decadence of social skills ?\nThat’s ok.. Things can only get better in future..\nHad breakfast ..\nSaw the spelling bee contest .. Gee!! how do these small kids know the spellings of all those difficult words. amazing !\nWatched soccer.. I was routing for Germany and they lost ! 2 – 0 . Whatta disgrace .\nWent to San Francisco in the evening to see Independence day fireworks.\nWe could see them only from far.

Some strong force was pulling him away. He clenched his teeth, tightened his muscles, held his fists in a tight grip, He tried .. to hold on for longer. It broke. But he wasn’t ready to give away, not yet. He leapt, stretched his hand and grasped a light ray. In a moment he wasn’t himself. As the luminous shaft shot ahead with break neck speed, his vision became blurred, he ceased to think.\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was far away. He was still riding on the light ray. But there was no sun, no planets in the vicinity. It was mostly dark. At a distance he could see specks of light from stars, light years away. He could feel that he wasn’t traveling as fast as he was in the beginning. Was the ray weakening ? A dread swept through him. What would happen ? Would the light die leaving him in groping in the darkness ? Without being able to see something, to hold somewhere ?\nIt came back suddenly! The talk. That was a different time, a different age, a different place. SN was talking.\n“You can see light only when it hits some object – say dust, and gets reflected. If there was no dust, no matter, i.e if there were only vacuum here, we wouldn’t see light. So, actually the universe is full of light. We cannot see it because of vacuum. In vacuum, light travels till infinity. It never reduces, never falters.”\nHe looked down. The light ray he was traveling on, it wasn’t there ! It struck him then, there are infinite rays of light around. He just couldn’t see them. He reached his hand above and felt another ray. He jumped on to it.

I have probably read the first chapter at least 5 or 6 times before I finally was able to finish reading the book around 2002 when I was working in Chennai. This is the second time I’ve read this book.\nIt is one of those books which the moment you finish reading, you will feel inspired, to do more, to yearn to lead a more fulfilling life. You will see the world in a new perspective with a feeling within you that things are more in your control than not.\nPART 1 - Paradigms and principles\n\nInside-out\n\n\n“There is no real excellence in all this world which can be separated from right living.&quot;&quot;\n~ David Starr Jordan\n\n\nThe Seven Habits : an overview\n\n\n“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”\n~ Aristotle\n\nPART 2 - Private victory\nHabit 1 - Be Proactive - Principles of personal vision\n\n“I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.”\n~ Henry David Thoreau\n\nBe proactive and have control over the outcomes rather than being reactive to everything around you.\nHabit 2 - Begin with the End in Mind- Principles of personal leadership\n\n“What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.”\n~ Oliver Wendell Holmes\n\nAlways visualize the end before starting something and this habit will help you focus better towards the goal.\nHabit 3 - Put First Things First - Principles of personal management\n\n“Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.”\n~ Goethe\n\nOnce you begin with end in mind and start implementing things, prioritize so that you always put most important things first.\nPART 3 - Public victory - Paradigms on interdependence\nHabit 4 - Think Win-Win - Principles of interpersonal leadership\n\n“There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity.” ~ Samuel Johnson\n“We have committed the Golden Rule to memory; let us now commit it to life.&quot;&quot; ~ Edwin Markha\n\nMost things in life don’t have to be a zero sum game. Win-Win is based on the assumption that there is plenty for everyone, and that success follows a co-operative approach more naturally than the confrontation of win-or-lose.\nHabit 5 - Seek First to Understand and then to be Understood - Principles of empathic communication\n\n“The heart has its reasons which reason knows not of.” ~ Pascal\n\nHabit 6 - Synergize - Principles of creative cooperation\n\n“I take as my guide the hope of a saint \nin crucial things, unity — \nin important things, diversity — \nin all things, generosity”\n~ Inaugural Address of President George Bush\n\nSynergy means that 1 + 1 may equal 8, 16, or even 1,600.\nPART 4 - Renewal\nHabit 7 - Sharpen the Saw - Principles of balanced self-renewal\n\n“Sometimes when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things… I am tempted to think…there are no little things.”\n~ Bruce Barton\n\n\nInside-out again\n\n\n“The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would  shape human behavior, but Christ can change human nature.\n~ Ezra Taft Benson\n"},"Blog/2007/2007-04-19---The-Blue-Lenses":{"slug":"Blog/2007/2007-04-19---The-Blue-Lenses","filePath":"Blog/2007/2007-04-19 - The Blue Lenses.md","title":"The Blue Lenses by Daphne du Maurier","links":[],"tags":["Fiction","Short-Stories","book-notes","blog"],"content":"A recent trip to Mount Shasta became more memorable due to me losing my glasses. When the optician asked me if I wanted the sunlight coating, I said yes. Well ! when someone sounds as though she’s offering the best thing in the world, you’ve got no option but to have it. Moreover insurance covered it (Insurance ! The secret American Ace). Just think of having a pair of glasses that turns black when you walk outside in sunlight and turns plain inside. Great ! I ordered one and the moment I started wearing, I didn’t like them. It looked as though I was wearing sun glasses all day.\nBut suddenly every day was a pleasant day. Be it sunny or cloudy, the day looked the same. Set me thinking.. Why do some people always see goodness ? Because they wear sunglasses in their minds. When they look into the world, they don’t see the scorching intense heat but pleasant evening. Always.\nReminds me of a duMaurier short story that I’d read sometime back - ‘The Blue Lenses’. The book which contains this story has another story you might’ve heard about – Birds. Yup. That famous Hitchcock movie was based on this.\nComing back, Imagine ! You suddenly turn into a person to whom the only thing that is obvious about other people are their bad attributes. You look at them and you see them as .. animals.\nThey talk to you and you cant talk may be because of hatred or may be dread.\nThat’s exactly what happens in “The blue lenses”. The main protagonist undergoes an eye operation where she is made to put on a pair of blue lenses before the actual lenses. She begins to see everyone strangely – all humans with animal heads and human bodies. One nurse has kitten’s head, the doc is a terrier, sis nancy is a snake. First she thinks it is a joke but she realizes it is not. She mentions this and gets varied responses. Mostly others are offended.\nIf you perceive something/someone as bad, should you tell them ? Is it because they’ve suddenly metamorphosed into something bad or your outlook has changed ?\n\nHeader Image - “Morning Calmness - San Francisco bay bridge” by David Yu via Flickr."},"Blog/2007/2007-08-05---Waking-Dream":{"slug":"Blog/2007/2007-08-05---Waking-Dream","filePath":"Blog/2007/2007-08-05 - Waking Dream.md","title":"Waking Dream","links":[],"tags":["blog"],"content":"In my dream I was sleeping.

I’m so certain that I took all the books sprawled under the bed and put it into this box. ”\nI gave a sheepish smile - “I know I know.. ”\nI took the box in my hand and turned it upside down. Opened it from the other end. All the books were there.\n“Wow !”\n“This is a magician’s box.”\nI wanted to show her the trapdoor and explain it to her.\nBut at that moment my eyes caught ‘Histories’ - Histories by Herodotus.\nSuddenly, everything dissolved. There was no box. There was no A.\nI was looking through a window into a room in which a nurse was reading this book to a burnt, faceless man on a bed. The man was recounting his past and the scenes were flashing on the wall behind.\nI could see Katherine reading the book by a fire - time leapt forward - now Almasy is leaving the injured Katherine in a cave - is walking in the desert for days - tragedy ! - he is captured by Germans - now he is back in a glider - carries her dead body in his arms - …\nIt was a story in which everybody had a story - a sad story. Afterall it was a time of war.\nThe movie ends with Hana reading Katherine’s words written on the margins of the last few pages of Herodotus. As Hana escapes from the monastery, Katherine’s voice is heard ..\n\n&quot;We die. We die rich with lovers and tribes. Tastes we have swallowed... bodies we have entered and swum up like rivers. Fears we&#039;ve hidden in, like this wretched cave. I want all this marked on my body. We&#039;re the real countries. Not the boundaries drawn on maps -- the names of powerful men. I know you&#039;ll come and carry me out into the palace of winds. That&#039;s all I&#039;ve wanted. To walk in such a place with you. With friends. An earth without maps.&quot;\nI bought ‘Histories’ the next day after I saw the movie, but never read it.\nNow it’s 4 AM.\nI’m awake wondering why I dreamt about ‘Histories’ and ‘The English Patient’.\nI’ve taken the book out of the shelf.\nIt’s totally unlike the worn out, dog eared one in the movie, the actual kind of books that I love to read. It is fresh and new. I’ve always loved the old books. The books which someone has read. To think that someone went through exactly the same experiences as I’m about to go through makes me happy I guess.\nI’m sitting here thinking the same thoughts, feeling the same feelings, of the undercurrent of undying love in ‘The English Patient’. I close my eyes and I can see the images flashing. Can I go back to my dream now? After all, it is the dream that got me this feeling. Can I go back to the dream through this feeling?\n\nHeader Image - “Painting of men in the Cave of the Swimmers, Wadi Sura, Gilf Kebir, Western Desert, Egypt” by Roland Unger via Wikipedia."},"Blog/2007/2007-08-07---A-Poet's-Corner":{"slug":"Blog/2007/2007-08-07---A-Poet's-Corner","filePath":"Blog/2007/2007-08-07 - A Poet's Corner.md","title":"A Poet's Corner","links":["SK"],"tags":["blog"],"content":"Re-lived a wonderful moment when I accidentally read one of my old scribblings.\nThere are some places where the moment you go, you feel completely at ease ; you’d stay, transfixed with a longing in your heart to be left there forever!

The moment you enter, you feel a warm, smooth embrace.

The winding stairs that led to a small study upstairs beckoned you to go up and when you did, it wasn’t merely going up in space, you felt as though you were elevated to a higher state.. you floated into heaven.\nIn the small study upstairs, the books on the shelf didn’t seem like sad children who were forcefully disciplined to stand at attention.. they seemed rather relaxed and smiling, leaning on each other, beckoning you to hold and touch and feel and experience.\nYou might end up standing there forever, wishing that the moment never went away..\nBut if you did, you’d miss the patio and the overlooking swimming pool and the painting stand by the side.\n_Dear Poet, thanks for making my day memorable.\nWhen I think back, there is much more to describe.

It is a given !\nBut to get a chance to walk shoulder to shoulder with giants, ah! other concerns vanish into obscurity.\nI have a new plan.

Sometimes I think my zeal to tell a story runs ahead of me and I tell the important points, mainly glorifying the best aspects beyond what they are.

So made some hot water, poured it into the flask and came upstairs to my room. Poured some hot water into a cup, opened a sachet of Emergen-C and eased myself on the beanbag with the book in one hand and cup in another. I was almost completely immersed into the book for almost two days. Slept a couple of times in the middle, refilled the cup with hot water almost mechanically, went down to have food ..etc but my mind was in the book and I completely forgot about everything else.\nGetting up after finishing the book was like going into a theatre and coming out.

We have no choice.” — ISAAC B. SINGER\n“There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn’t true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.” — SØREN KIERKEGAARD\n“And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell.” — HERMAN MELVILLE\n“I maintain that the human mystery is incredibly demeaned by scientific reductionism, with its claim in promissory materialism to account eventually for all of the spiritual world in terms of patterns of neuronal activity. This belief must be classed as a superstition … . we have to recognize that we are spiritual beings with souls existing in a spiritual world as well as material beings with bodies and brains existing in a material world.” — SIR JOHN C. ECCLES\n“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as if everything is.” — ALBERT EINSTEIN\n“If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.” — RENÉ DESCARTES\n“I must be willing to give up what I am in order to become what I will be.” — ALBERT EINSTEIN\n“Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all others.” — CICERO\nThe last chapter “The Photograph” had a very interesting twist and had an amazing poem called “When Tomorrow Starts Without Me.” by David Romano.\nWhere to find the book to buy\n\neBay : www.ebay.com/ctg/Proof-of-Heaven-A-Neurosurgeons-Journey-into-the-Afterlife-by-Eben-III-Alexander-2012-Paperback/143365475\nAmazon : www.amazon.com/Proof-Heaven-Neurosurgeons-Journey-Afterlife/dp/1451695195\n\n\nHeader Image - “Great Light A” by Birrell Walsh via Flickr."},"Blog/2015/2015-01-10---The-End-of-Power":{"slug":"Blog/2015/2015-01-10---The-End-of-Power","filePath":"Blog/2015/2015-01-10 - The End of Power.md","title":"The End of Power by Moses Naim","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Leadership","Business","Geopolitics","book-notes","blog"],"content":"Mark Zuckerberg posts a public challenge/goal for himself at the beginning of every year and in 2015 it was to read a new book every two weeks.\n\n“Power no longer buys as much as it did in the past. In the 21st century, power is easy to get, harder to use - and easy to lose.”\n\n‘The End of Power’ was the first book chosen. The theme of the book is that power is not what it used to be. People in power are not as powerful as in the past and not as much as we sometimes think them to be. Power has weakened because barriers to power have reduced by the “More”, “Mobility” and “Mentality” revolution. The book makes one think about the world around us. In a way, the world has become more democratic and ordinary people have access/chance to rise to the top but when one looks at the world from the top, it is more chaotic and difficult to manage. One might choose to not get into management/leadership positions because of this.\nChapter 1\t: The Decay of Power\n\n“Power is the ability to direct or prevent the current or future actions of other groups and individuals.”\n\nThis chapter gives the example of James Black Jr., a 12 yr old from a working class family in Brooklyn, NY who becomes a Chess Grandmaster at the age of 12. It is a global trend. More players are learning the game and achieving mastery sooner than their predecesors, many of them on their own!. The reason is because the easier access to knowledge - of millions of games by other Grandmasters or computer simulation of moves, made by digital revolution and the internet. The author goes on to say that the similar trend is seen in all the other aspects of life. The chapter also gives us an overview of what the book’s is going to talk about.\nChapter 2\t: Making Sense of Power: How It Works and How to Keep It\n\n“Identify the barriers to power and whether they are coming up or going down, and you can solve a large part of the puzzle of power.”\n\nThe main theme of this chapter is extend the definition of power in the first chapter. Power is expressed through four different means - The Muscle, The Code, The Pitch, The Reward.\nMacMillan’s Taxonomy of Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome seen as improvementOutcome seen as nonimprovementChange incentivesInducement via reward: Increase the salary, lower a priceCoercion via muscle: Law enforcement, repression, violenceChange preferencesPersuasion via pitch: Advertising, campaigningObligation via code: Religious or traditional duty, moral suasion\nChapter 3\t: How Power Got Big: An Assumption’s Unquestioned Rise\n\n“Weber’s central message was that without a reliable, well-functioning organization, or, to use his term, without a bureaucracy, power could not be effectively wielded.”\n\nThe main theme of this chapter is to about how companies throughout the world became huge, especially after the World War II. Huge companies could be managed only via hierarchies and bureaucracy. The author talks in depth about Max Weber, German sociologist who analyzed Western economies and wrote about bureaucracy and how it would lead to power being managed by big corporations.\nChapter 4\t: How Power Lost Its Edge: The More, Mobility, and Mentality Revolutions\n\n“The decoupling of power from size, and thus the decoupling of the capacity to use power effectively from the control of a large Weberian bureaucracy, is changing the world.”\n\n\nThe More revolution - Overwhelming the means of control\nThe Mobility revolution - The end of captive audiences\nThe Mentality revolution - Taking nothing for granted anymore\n\nPower and the three revolutions:\n\nChapter 5\t: Why Are Landslides, Majorities, and Mandates Endangered Species? The Decay of Power in National Politics\n\n“Accordingly, the noble art of governing now depends more heavily on a much dirtier, hands-on skill: forming and maintaining a coalition.”\n\nThe main theme of this chapter is the before and after contrast of the governments across the world - number of sovereign nations has quadrupled since 1945, democracies have increased, autocracies have gone down, there are more hung parliaments now, very few landslide victories, etc.\nChapter 6\t: Pentagons Versus Pirates: The Decaying Power of Large Armies\nChapter 7\t: Whose World Will It Be?

It is not like learning a different language or different version of Java from Java 2 (1.2) to Java 8. The first time I was exposed to functional programming is probably around 2012 when I had to do a project for an ML course using R language. It was refreshing to do things differently for sure. Thanks to RV, I learnt the basics of Clojure last year. I’m at a stage where I can read Clojure code and understand and may be write very simple programs but not beyond that. Anyway, the paradigm shift that Ford talks about can be summarized in the example that he gives in the first chapter of the book.\n\nLet’s say for a moment that you are a lumberjack. You have the best axe in the forest, which makes you the most productive lumberjack in the camp. Then one day someone shows up and extols the virtues of a new tree-cutting paradigm, the chainsaw. The sales guy is persuasive, so you buy a chainsaw, but you don’t know how it works. Demonstrating your expertise with the previous tree-cutting paradigm, you swing it vigorously at a tree—without cranking it. You quickly conclude that this newfangled chainsaw is a fad, and you return to your axe. Then, someone appears and shows you how to crank the chainsaw.\n\nThe best thing about the book is that he gives a lot of code examples. So one needs to just think of how to solve these examples and get the gist of what is being talked about.\nChapter 1 : Why\n\n“OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code under‐ standable by minimizing moving parts.” ~ Michael Feathers\n\nThis chapter provides a broad overview and shows some examples of the mental shift that the author is teaching us.\n\nExample 1-1. Word frequencies in Java\nExample 1-2. Word frequencies in Java 8\nExample 1-3. indexOfAny() from Apache Commons StringUtils\n\nThe IndexofAny() method accepts a String and an array and returns the index of the first occurrence in the String of any of the characters in the array\n\n\nExample 1-4. indexOfAny() example cases\nExample 1-5. Scala version of firstIndexOfAny()\nExample 1-6. Returning a lazy list of matches\n\nExcercise to self\n\nWrite a program in Java 8 or Clojure which takes in a String of words separated by space (“a quick brown fox”) and returns a map of word frequencies.\nWrite a program in Java 8 or Clojure that mimics ‘indexOfAny() from Apache Commons StringUtils’. This method accepts a String and an array and returns the index of the first occurrence in the String of any of the characters in the array.\n\nChapter 2 : Shift\n\n“Once garbage collection became mainstream, it simultaneously eliminated entire categories of hard-to-debug problems and allowed the runtime to manage a process that is complex and error-prone for developers. Functional programming aims to do the same thing for the algorithms you write, allowing you to work at a higher level of abstraction while freeing the runtime to perform sophisticated optimizations.&quot;&quot;\n\n\nExample 2-1. Typical company process (in Java)\n\nLet’s say that you are given a list of names, some of which consist of a single character, and you are asked to return a comma-delimited string with the single letter names removed, with each name capitalized.\n\n\nExample 2-2. Pseudocode for the “company process”\nExample 2-3. Processing functionally in Scala\nExample 2-4. Java 8 version of the Company Process\nExample 2-5. Processing in Groovy\nExample 2-6.

I paid my dues in languages like C++ for too many years, and I don’t want to surrender the conveniences of modern languages. That’s the story of how software development progresses.”\n\nIt’s so great to see this comment in the book! I spent close to a year in 2007 and over a year in 2015-2016 to re-engineer C++ applications into Java. Though the projects were for different companies (ebay and paypal), co-incidentally, both applications were related to payments!\nIn this chapter, the author shows five ways developers in functional languages can cede control to the language or runtime, freeing themselves to work on more relevant problems.\n\nIteration to Higher-Order Functions\nClosures\nCurrying and Partial Application\n\nCurrying describes the conversion of a multiargument function into a chain of single-argument functions.\nPartial application describes the conversion of a multiargument function into one that accepts fewer arguments, with values for the elided arguments supplied in advance.\n\n\nRecursion\nStreams and Work Reordering\n\n\nExample 3-1.

I discovered Prime reading accidentally, that too when searching for deals during thanksgiving !! It is a great offering from Amazon. I’m amazed. I always felt that kindle/prime lending wasn’t that great. You never got the book that you wanted, there were restrictions around one per month..etc. I thought I will stop my prime membership next year since I’m not using prime much and haven’t had a lot of time to view movies or TV series off late. But due to “Prime Reading”, I’ll continue with prime for a long time, I’m sure. It doesn’t have a great collection yet, but I think it will come. Looking forward to a day where I can borrow books from my local library through kindle. I can borrow e-books and read from ‘Overdrive’ app on my phone but still nothing matches the experience of reading from a kindle.\nMy impression of reading this book was that it was very inspiring. It is an easy, fast read, one feels like the author is an inspiring preacher who talks to you from a podium and you’re listening to him with rapt attention. You would love the idea of focusing on one thing, timeblocking (4 hours !) and other practical steps to make life more streamlined. After reading the book, you walk away with a feeling that you’ve gained an insight and will transform your life to follow what was said. Of course, after a few days, you go back to being the old self, being reactive to everything around and multi-tasking and not have time for anything. I think reading the notes again will re-inforce the learning and will slowly change the way you do things.\nHighlights from my Kindle\n“Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it.

That’s it.”\n“It takes an average of 66 days to acquire a new habit.”\n“The more we use our mind, the less minding power we have.”\n“The problem with living in the middle is that it prevents you from making extraordinary time commitments to anything.\n“To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. This requires getting extremely out of balance in relation to all other work issues.”\n“When you act on your priority, you’ll automatically go out of balance, giving more time to one thing over another.”\n“A big opportunity is better than a small one, but a small problem is better than a big one.”\n“The good news is that science isn’t about guessing, but rather the art of progressing.”\n“What you build today will either empower or restrict you tomorrow.”\n“Achievement and abundance show up because they’re the natural outcomes of doing the right things with no limits attached.”\n“A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.”\n“Quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question.”\n“Anyone who dreams of an uncommon life eventually discovers there is no choice but to seek an uncommon approach to living it.”\n“Your big ONE Thing is your purpose and your small ONE Thing is the priority you take action on to achieve it.”\n“Our purpose sets our priority and our priority determines the productivity our actions produce.”\n“Connect today to all your tomorrows.”\n“Putting together a life of extraordinary results simply comes down to getting the most out of what you do, when what you do matters.”\n“The people who achieve extraordinary results don’t achieve them by working more hours.

Finally, out of desperation, I went as small as I could possibly go and asked: “What’s the ONE Thing you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?” And the most awesome thing happened. Results went through the roof.\nChapter 2 : The Domino Effect\n\n“Every great change starts like falling dominoes.” ~ BJ Thornton\n\nLet’s line up all the ‘ducks in a row’ is a phrase that my previous manager AH used to use often. It does make sense. When you line up the right things, with one flick, you can start a chain reaction of great things.\nSuccess builds on success. When you see someone who has a lot of knowledge, they learned it over time. When you see someone who has done a lot, they accomplished it over time. The key is ‘over time’.\nChapter 3 : Success Leaves Clues\n\n“It is those who concentrate on but one thing at a time who advance in this world.” ~ Og Mandino\n\nPassion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.\nWhen the author says “The ONE Thing shows up time and again in the lives of the successful because it’s a fundamental truth.”, I’m reminded of the ‘Matthew Effect’ from “Outliers” - ‘To one who has, more will be given ..‘”\nPART 1 : The Lies - They Mislead and Derail Us\nThe Six Lies Between You and Success:\n\nEverything Matters Equally\nMultitasking\nA Disciplined Life\nWillpower Is Always on Will-Call\nA Balanced Life\nBig is Bad\n\nChapter 4.\tEverything Matters Equally\n\n“Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.” —Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nWhen everything feels important, everything seems equal. We become busy-bodies, fully active but not moving towards success. Busyness rarely takes care of business !!\nIn his seminal book Quality Control Handbook, Juran adopted Pareto principle of 20/80 to highlight “vital few and trivial many”. 20% of things that we do has 80% of impact.\nTransform to-do list to ‘success list’. Take 20% of the to-do list to make the success list. Take the 20% of that, iteratively you can reach the ‘one’ most important thing.\nChapter 5.\tMultitasking\n\n“To do two things at once is to do neither.” —Publilius Syrus\n\nMultitasking is a lie. There is a cost to task-switching that most people don’t realize they are paying. Distraction undermines results and you can end up doing nothing well. Also it takes a toll on mind and body.\nChapter 6.\tA Disciplined Life\n\n“It’s one of the most prevalent myths of our culture: self-discipline.” —Leo Babauta\n\nSuccess is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right. ‘Selected discipline’ by channeling the energy to important things is very crucial. It takes an average of 66 days to form a habit. Build one habit at a time and give each habit enough time so that it becomes a routine.\nChapter 7.\tWillpower Is Always on Will-Call\n\n“Odysseus understood how weak willpower actually is when he asked his crew to bind him to the mast while sailing by the seductive Sirens.” —Patricia Cohen\n\nWillpower is alway on-call is a lie. Like the charge of a battery, it goes down with usage. So it is super important to prioritize the right thing to do when willpower is higher.\nWillpower is important. For e.g., the Marshamallow experiment done by Walter Michel at Stanford in the 60s and 70s where kids were given a marshamallow and were told that they could have that now or if they wait for 15 minutes, they could eat two. Kids who exercised willpower and delayed their gratification were found (on average) to be more successful later in life.\nWillpower gets reduced on usage. Another study done at Stanford by Prof Baba Shiv - where he divided undergrad students into 2 groups and asked them to memorize some numbers. The first group had to memorize 2-digit numbers and the second 7-digit numbers. They had to then walk across a hallway, to another room and tell the numbers to someone. On the way, they were offered 2 foods - chocolate cake or fruit salad. Students who were asked to memorize 7-digit numbers were twice as likely to choose chocolate (unhealthy treat) since they had reduced willpower.\nWillpower gets reduced if you don’t eat. Research shows that people who do not eat make roughly twice as many errors than those who do.\nWhen willpower is low, we tend to fallback on default settings or on autopilot. This leads to errors in judgement.\nMany things tax our willpower - Implementing new behaviors, Filtering distractions, Resisting temptation, Suppressing emotion, Restraining aggression, Suppressing impulses, Taking tests, Trying to impress others, Coping with fear, Doing something you don’t enjoy, etc.\nMost important thing to remember is that when it comes to willpower, timing is crucial.\nChapter 8.\tA Balanced Life\n\n“The truth is, balance is bunk. It is an unattainable pipe dream… . The quest for balance between work and life, as we’ve come to think of it, isn’t just a losing proposition; it’s a hurtful, destructive one.” —Keith H. Hammonds\n\nBalanced life is a lie, a myth. The term itself was coined only in the 1980s.\nMagic happens at the extremes. To achieve extraordinary results one must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. That may be work or life. And then counterbalance later to offset it.\nThink about life as two balancing buckets - work life and personal life, each with its own counterbalancing goals and approaches.\nChapter 9.\tBig Is Bad\n\n“We are kept from our goal, not by obstacles but by a clear path to a lesser goal.” —Robert Brault\n\nBig is bad is a lie. You should not be afraid of big success and end up sabotaging your own efforts to achieve it. There are a lot of examples of people who went all in and lost everything. And those are used to create fear. So we tend to play it safe.\nNo one knows the ultimate limit of what we can achieve. So it is better to think big, dream big.\nThink big - Act big - Succeed big.\nPART 2 : The Truth – The Simple Path to Productivity\n\n“Be careful how you interpret the world; it is like that.” — Erich Heller\n\nChapter 10.\tThe Focusing Question\n\n“There is an art to clearing away the clutter and focusing on what matters most. It is simple and it is transferable. It just requires the courage to take a different approach.” — George Anders\n\nGreat questions are path to great answers.\n“Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.” - Voltaire\n“A prudent question is one-half of wisdom.” - Sir Francis Bacon\n“The power to question is the basis of all human progress.” - Indira Gandhi\nFocusing Question -\n\n“WHAT’S the one thing I can do such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary.”\n\nChapter 11.\tThe Success Habit\n\n“Success is simple. Do what’s right, the right way, at the right time.” —Arnold H. Glasow\n\nThe Focusing Question is the foundational habit to use to achieve great results.\nImportant areas of life\n\nSpiritual Life\nPhysical Health\nPersonal Life\nKey Relationships\nJob\nBusiness\nFinancial Life\n\nLeverage reminders and recruit support to keep your success habit working as powerfully as possible.\nChapter 12.\tThe Path to Great Answers\n\n“People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.” —F. M. Alexander\n\nFour options for framing a Great Question.\nQ4. Small &amp; Specific\nQ3. Small &amp; Broad\nQ2. Big &amp; Broad\nQ1. Big &amp; Specific\nWhen you ask a Great Question, you’re in essence pursuing a great goal.\nThinking big and specific is key to a great question. Think Possibilities and benchmark and trend for the best answer.\nPART 3 : Extraordinary Results - Unlocking the Possibilities Within You\n\n“Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.” — Will Rogers\n\nChapter 13.\tLive with Purpose\n\n“Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.” —George Bernard Shaw\n\nGary goes over Scrooge’s story to illustrate that “our purpose sets our priority and our priority determines the productivity our actions produce”.\nYou cannot seek happiness. It happens in the journey. Discover your big “Why” and do things that bring purpose to your everyday actions.\nChapter 14.\tLive by Priority\n\n“Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now.” —Alan Lakein\n\nPurpose is very important and has the power to shape our lives only in direct proportion to the power of the priority we connect it to. Purpose without priority is powerless.\nFuture purpose should connect to current priority.\nChapter 15.\tLive for Productivity\n\n“Productivity isn’t about being a workhorse, keeping busy or burning the midnight oil… . It’s more about priorities, planning, and fiercely protecting your time.” —Margarita Tartakovsky\n\nExtraordinary results come when you get the most out of what you do.\nTime blocking is key for achieving great productivity.\nTime block 3 things in the following order -\n\nTime block your timeoff.\nTime block your ONE Thing.\nTime block your planningtime.\n\nTo experience extraordinary results, be a ‘maker’ in the morning and a ‘manager’ in the afternoon.\n4 proven ways to battle distractions -\n\nBuild a bunker\nStore provisions\nSweep for mines\nEnlist support\n\nChapter 16.\tThe Three Commitments\n\n“Nobody who ever gave his best regretted it.” —George Halas\n\nMastery can happen only if you commit to be the best. Take ownership of your outcomes.\nThe 3 commitments to your one thing:\n\nFollow the Path of Mastery\nMove from “E” (Entrepreneurial) to “P” (Purposeful).\nLive the Accountability Cycle\n\nChapter 17.\tThe Four Thieves\n\n“Focus is a matter of deciding what things you’re not going to do.” —John Carmack\n\nThe 4 thieves of Productivity\n\nInability to say “No”\nFear of Chaos\nPoor Health Habits\nEnvironment Doesn’t Support Your Goals\n\nI’ve personally had issues with 1 and 2. The key thing to remember is “When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to.” Also, make peace with loose ends and clutter!\nChapter 18.\tThe Journey\n\n“To get through the hardest journey we need take only one step at a time, but we must keep on stepping.” —Chinese Proverb\n\nA life worth living might be measured in many ways, but the one way that stands above all others is living a life of no regrets. One step at a time, focusing on the ONE big thing.\nPutting The ONE Thing to Work\n\n“In delay there lies no plenty.” -William Shakespeare\n\nThe key thing to make it work is to develop the habit of asking the ‘Focusing Question’ and keep it up."},"Blog/2016/2016-12-15--Blink":{"slug":"Blog/2016/2016-12-15--Blink","filePath":"Blog/2016/2016-12-15- Blink.md","title":"Blink - The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcom Gladwell","links":["General-Notes/People/Authors/Malcom-Gladwell"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Leadership","Psychology","book-notes","blog"],"content":"Blink - The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcom Gladwell\nI like the writing style of Malcom Gladwell. With enchanting short real-life stories and fascinating anecdotes, he takes you right into the book, to a different world where you are a student who is observing and studying the behavior of the people in different parts of the world, effortlessly moving to and fro through different periods of time.\nINTRODUCTION - The Statue That Didn’t Look Right\n\nFast and Frugal\nThe Internal Computer\nA Different and Better World\n\nThis chapter tells the story of a kouros that was purchased by Paul Getty museum. The museum authorities had certified it as legitimate after over 2 years of research. But during the opening, some art historians and other experts ‘felt’ that it was fake by just looking at it.\n\nIn the first two seconds of looking — in a single glance — they were able to understand more about the essence of the statue than the team at the Getty was able to understand after fourteen months.\nBlink is a book about those first two seconds.\n\nThe chapter lays a foundation for what the book is about and is a very engaging introduction to keep you from putting the book down.\nONE - The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way\n\nThe Love Lab\nMarriage and Morse Code\nThe Importance of Contempt\nThe Secrets of the Bedroom\nListening to Doctors\nThe Power of the Glance\n\nThe chapter starts with the story of a couple in their twenties - Bill &amp; Susan - who go to the University of Washington to visit the laboratory of a psychologist named John Gottman. They talk about their dog and Gottman videotapes the conversation for 15 minutes. Gottman and team then assign a SPAFF code to every second of the couple’s interaction. [SPAFF code assigns a number to every emotion - Disgust is 1, contempt is 2, anger is 7, defensiveness is 10 .. and so on]. Gottman has proven that he got 95% success of predicting whether a marriage will endure or not by using 1 hour of video and 90% success by 15 minutes.\n\nTo make an accurate prediction about something as serious as the future of a marriage indeed, to make a prediction of any sort — it seems that we would have to gather a lot of information and in as many different contexts as possible.\nBut John Gottman has proven that we don’t have to do that at all.\n\nHe goes further to say that of all the emotions in the SPAFF code, he can find out much about a couple by just focusing on what he calls the “Four Horsemen”: defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Of these 4, contempt is the most important of them all. Criticism is good in a relationship but contempt is very bad.\n\n..presence of contempt in a marriage can even predict such things as how many colds a husband or a wife gets; in other words, having someone you love express contempt toward you is so stressful that it begins to affect the functioning of your immune system.\n\nThen he talks about doctors who get sued vs who don’t and about the research that was done by studying hundreds of recorded conversations between doctors and patients. It is not the doctors with less degrees or qualifications who get sued but mostly the ones that don’t talk much to patients.\nHe also talks about how some people are able to make judgments with just a glance. Brian Grazer knew that Tom Hanks was a star material at the very first meeting !\nTWO - The Locked Door: The Secret Life of Snap Decisions\n\nPrimed for Action\nThe Storytelling Problem\n\nThe chapter starts with the story of Vic Braden, a top tennis coach who could predict when a player would make a double fault. Double faults are rare but he could almost always predict them. But he was unable to explain how he was able to do it. Gladwell goes on to say that snap judgements happen so fast that our conscious mind cannot grasp all the infomration that was used in that instant to arrive at the judgement. When we try to break the process down to explain, we fail to express clearly the thought process that went behind.\nHe then talks about a priming experiment where when a group of students were ‘primed’ by telling them a set of words like “rude”, “bold”, “disturb” ..etc, their behavior was different from another set of students who were primed with different set of pleasant words. Wow! What we listen to matters so much.\nThen he talks about the ‘Speed dating’ experiment done by Iyengar and Fisman from Columbia. When someone said they liked another, the researchers would ask them to explain the reason they cannot. In fact, what the participants said they liked differed from what they actually liked. For e.g, someone said they like people who are intelligent and sincere but they end up choosing someone who is attractive and funny but not particularly sincere or smart at all !\nHe goes on to say that it happens because people are not able to open the locked door - to access the subconscious that made the snap judgement.\nTHREE - The Warren Harding Error: Why We Fall For Tall, Dark, and Handsome Men\n\nThe Dark Side of Thin Slicing\nBlink in Black and White\nTaking Care of the Customer\nSpotting the Sucker\nThink About Dr. King\n\nThis chapter was a bit of a ‘reality check’. Until this point, we are in complete awe of the power of snap judgements, thin slicing ..etc and everything comes crashing down in this chapter. It is like someone saying - “listen to your intuition” and the moment you are prepared to do that, someone says “intuition is bad because we are swayed by our prejudices and what we have been exposed to”. The author then gives a series of word associations with European vs African American and Men vs Women. The exercise was interesting.\nHe then talks about and extra ordinarily successful salesman named\nFOUR - Paul Van Riper’s Big Victory: Creating Structure for Spontaneity\nFIVE - Kenna’s Dilemma: The Right— and Wrong—Way to Ask People What They Want\nSIX - Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading\nCONCLUSION - Listening with Your Eyes: The Lessons of Blink\nAfterword"},"Blog/2018/2018-12-05---Fox---How-to-Become-CEO":{"slug":"Blog/2018/2018-12-05---Fox---How-to-Become-CEO","filePath":"Blog/2018/2018-12-05 - Fox - How to Become CEO.md","title":"How to Become CEO - The Rules for Rising to the Top of Any Organization by Jeffrey J.

Back in 2005, NC had mentioned him as a great author who wrote cyber thrillers and I should definitely read. Time passed by, I forgot about this and when someone recently mentioned Stephenson in a chat about books, I thought I must get hold of a copy. Reading a paperback after a long time was fun. I felt it didn’t live up to the hype and it took me a bit of time to get into the book. But if you read the backcover, you’d surely be intrigued enough to give it a try. Here it is, verbatim -\n“Only once in a great while does a writer come along who defies comparison—a writer so original he redefines the way we look at the world. Neal Stephenson is such a writer and Snow Crash is such a novel, weaving virtual reality, Sumerian myth, and just about everything in between with a cool, hip cybersensibility to bring us the gigathriller of the information age.”\nThe main takeaway for me was that you could literally die if you read a string of characters in a particular order even if you don’t understand it. I’ve heard of people saying similar things about words that you hear. When you hear words spoken in a specifc sequence, you could get affected. For e.g., magical incantations in Sanskrit or Latin. Since words that you hear and words that you see are processed by the brain, it is theoretically possible that the brain’s wirings could get impacted mysteriously by some sequence that we don’t yet understand."},"Blog/2019/2019-08-01----12-Rules-for-Life":{"slug":"Blog/2019/2019-08-01----12-Rules-for-Life","filePath":"Blog/2019/2019-08-01 -  12 Rules for Life.md","title":"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan Peterson","links":["General-Notes/People/Authors/Jordan-Peterson"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Philosophy","Psychology","book-notes","blog"],"content":"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan Peterson\nJordan Peterson is one of those people who does not mince words.

You also get a feeling that you’ve not been doing enough and need to step up and take more responsibilities.\nI enjoyed reading the book. Every rule is a context where he explains his philosophy and the reasoning behind them. He makes references that are wide-ranging - mythology, Bible, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Viktor Frankl, and so on. I wonder how someone who hasn’t read Bible or Tolstoy could grasp everything in the book. Would definitely like to read it again and write a longer summary and notes.\nSome portions can come across as elaborate explanation to make a simple point. But I found that type of story telling fascinating. His words are stern and advice direct. There are some great quotes.\nThe overarching theme is that ‘the person’ matters. Every person can change, and can effect change. Every person has to make a hero’s journey to succeed. There is no gold without the dragon. Find your dragon and slay it.

And there are others that start with a bang. ‘Of love and other demons’ is definitely in the latter category.\nThe books opens with a letter from Marquez on how he came upon the story. On a routine round to cover a story for his newspaper, the author is sent to find out about the emptying/transportation of crypts of Santa Clara Convent, which is in a dilapidated state. He comes across an astonishing sight when after one of the crypts is open, they see copper colored hair  on a skeleton head. It was as if the hair grew after death out of the skeleton. The author is reminded of a story that his grandmother had told him about a young girl with long hair, who got bitten by a dog, became mad and was later venerated as a saint since she performed miracles.\nFrom the get go, when “an ash gray dog with a white blaze”, charges into a market and bites the protagonist, a young girl who is the daughter of a local nobleman, the novel transports the reader to a different place in a different era, and doesn’t let go. Till the last page, we’re intrigued by what is going to happen and are rooting for Sierva Maria to come out of the whole ordeal victorious.\nI’d always wanted to read Marquez. I’d heard about this famous book ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ in high school or college, as a quiz question or may be it was a crossword puzzle on The Hindu. It was at the back of my mind. I read the prologue of this book our local library and was totally hooked. It was a worth read. AK also read the book. She also bought ‘One Hundred Years’. Haven’t gotten to reading that yet though.\nIn short, the novel is about a young girl getting bitten (very small bite) by a dog. She is actually not affected but due to the rumours and superstitions, she is forced to undergo exorcism by many people. Finally is brought to a convent. The young priest there falls in love with the girl. Though he recommends that she is not mad, the authorities don’t listen. It ends tragically for all the ‘good’ people in the book.\nWhat is good and not good is often a gray area. If you follow society’s norms and act in the way it expects, then you’re branded as good. The religious fanaticism that existed in the 17th century South America exists even today, almost everywhere in the world.\nThe novel explores many themes, and one of them is the fight between good and evil. One could say that the ‘good’ is the truth and everything that is natural in the world. The ‘evil’ is dogma and superstition that plagued the society during that time period. A strong belief in demons and reliance on hearsay, made the people around Sierva Maria see her differently than what she really was. She was just a 12 year old adolescent who was coming out of childhood into adulthood. She was also a victim of neglect by her parents. Her Yoruban beliefs, songs, dances, painting her face black, etc. were part of her growing up and it was natural for her. But it was tangential to her European parents or the Church.\nIn a way, the novel conveys that going against the confines of the present norms can sometimes work, or sometimes go awry. When a new idea upends an old one, it is many times because of myriads of factors that led to that time. Though people always venerate heroes who led the revolution without realizing that the people were the instruments and the revolution would have happened regardless of that particular person.\nAlso, I think the novel depicts that the conflict between good and evil is a human condition. Though we could judge the people based on our moral compass and group them as good vs evil, every person is fighting the battle against evil. What he or she thinks is evil could be based on his/her level of intelligence or what they’ve been told. It is not just the external evil but also the internal one. The internal conflict sometimes manifests externally by being too good to people or too cruel. So a human life’s journey is about fighting their own battle with their hidden evil and also fighting the external forces of evil from their standpoint.\nThe novel also alludes to the fact that people may not fully be in control of their destiny. One can only attempt to be true to oneself and hope that it aligns with the surroundings.\n\nOf Love and Other Demons"},"Blog/2020/2020-01-04---Factfulness":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-01-04---Factfulness","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-01-04 - Factfulness.md","title":"Factfulness - Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think By Hans Rosling,  Anna Rosling Rönnlund, Ola Rosling","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Sociology","Psychology","book-notes","blog"],"content":"I read this book on the way back from our Alaska Trip during during last winter (2019).

The whole journey took a day since we started around 9-ish in the morning. The book was engaging and awesome. The twist in the end totally took me by surprise. Throughout the book, you feel like Hans Rosling is directly talking to you and then ..\nIt is a positive book. It tells us that the world is in a much better state than we think it is in. In that way it is very similar to Steven Pinker’s “The Better Angels of Our Nature”. Better Angels was the second book that Mark Zuckerberg had read in his 2015 book reading challenge. There are a lot of interesting insights in the book that would enable us to see life and the world in a different light. Instead of dividing the world and developed and developing, he divides it as Level 1, L2, L3 and level 4.

Read on the flight from SF to Portland and from there to Anchorage. The bulk of the reading was done during the full-day train journey from Anchorage to Fairbanks on the 3rd day of the trip. That was a magical train journey - to go through untouched snow in a vast land seemingly out of nowhere.\nI had listened to ‘Sapiens’ through Hoopla a couple of years back. Probably twice. During my practice runs for the half-marathon that I was running that year and also during the run itself. Audio books are much slower reads than actual reading and I sometimes tend to zone out. Hoping to read the book on print/kindle in the future. But whatever I had heard, it was thought provoking and a well written book. It alters your perspective of the world and you begin to see the entire human history in a different light.\nThe author mentions that Sapiens was about the past of humanity, Home Deus was about the future and this book is about the present. He takes 21 problems, or 21 pressing concerns that the world if facing right now and addresses each of them. It is like reading 21 essays on different topics, well-articulated essays.\nPart I: The Technological Challenge\nChapter 1: Disillusionment\nHumans think in stories than facts. Harari had mentioned in Sapiens that the key reason for ascendency of Homo Sapiens was the story telling ability.\n\nThe fascist story - History is a struggle of nations/races and one tries to subjugate another. Let’s give importance to our nation and our ideals.\nThe communist story - History is a struggle of classes where the upper class always tried to subjugate the lower. Let’s envision a classless society.\nThe liberal story - History is a struggle of liberty and tyranny. Let’s build a world of freedom and equality.\n\n1938 - 3 global stories to choose from, 1968 - 2 stories to choose from (liberal, communist), 1998 - a single story (liberal democracy), 2018 - no story. Disillusionment !\nHarari says that 2008 financial crisis precipitated the disillusionment and gave rise to a lot of pro-national sentiments. With the rise of Trump and Brexit in 2016, people seem to have developed a liking for the old racist and nationalist views. Nostalgia - Britain thinking of old glory, Islamist thinking of how things were 1400 yrs back during Caliphate, Zionists dreaming of going back 2,500 years back, and so forth!\nLoved the paragraph about “Humans vote with their feet”. So true! There are millions of people who wish to immigrate to the US, Germany, Canada or Australia. How many wish to immigrate to China, India or Vietnam? People are willing to undergo extreme hardship to just cross the border and come to the US though there is so much bad press about how immigrants are treated badly, especially the ones from south of the border. How many Islamists from Syria or other countries want to migrate to Kuwait or Saudi vs Germany?\nHarari defines a liberal set menu which outlines what it means at National and International level for Economic, Political and Personal areas. He is optimistic that people will not abandon liberal ideas altogether because of lack of viable alternatives. The dish might contain some items from the menu if not all.\nChapter 2: Work\nThe fear of losing job to a machine has been there since the beginning of Industrial Revolution. But, if you look at the stats, for every job lost to a machine, at least one new job was created. Every job lost to the machine raised the standard of living multi-fold. But future may be different. Work in 2050 might to totally different since AI seeks to not just replace the mechanical work that humans do but cognitive also.\nThere are some tasks that AI is much better than humans. For e.g. driving. Driverless cars could reduce fatality by 90%! degree. Two important non-human abilities that AI possesses are connectivity and updatability. If there are a billion doctors in the world who need to be updated about a new disease, it is almost impossible, but if there were AI-doctors who are networked, it is almost instantaneous.\nIn areas like elder care, music, art, etc., it might take longer for AI to do what humans do.\nIn many fields, there might be more AI cooperation than competition. Also new jobs to debug, service AI will be created. But the key thing about the new jobs that will get created will be that they will require expertise. So retraining might be difficult.\nIn 2017 Google’s AlphaZero defeated Stockfish 8 program in a game of chess. The milestone was critical since AlphaZero learnt chess from scratch in 4 hours! AI is competing with other AI and not with humans anymore!\nThe author does say that rise of AI may not lead to exploitation of humans like it happened during the Industrial Revolution. It might get to a point where everything becomes efficient and people are provided with what they need - food, clothing &amp; shelter. If one gets these things for free, will people go into irrelevance? Wow, one is reminded of ‘The Matrix’ here. AI could actually put all humans to sleep and keep them in a dream state so that they don’t destroy the earth!\nThe author talks about UBI (Universal Basic Income) or Universal Basic Services where social services are subsidized. It could become the utopian vision of communism!\nHe gives example of ultra-orthodox Jews who are poor and unemployed and spend all their time in studying scriptures. They are supported by the government and they are reported to have higher life satisfaction than other groups who have money and are employed!\nThe chapter ends with a positive, powerful note - “The quest for meaning and community might eclipse the quest for a job. If we manage to combine a universal economic safety net with strong communities and meaningful pursuits, losing our jobs to algorithms might actually turn out to be a blessing.”\nChapter 3: Liberty\nDuring the Brexit vote, Ricard Dawkins had said that normal people should not have been asked to vote since most of them are not equipped to know the economic and political consequences of the decision. Elections are about what we feel and not what may be good for us. What people feel are mostly defined by their news feed or search results.\nComputer algorithm might be better equipped to counsel humans than human feelings.\nb×c×d = ahh Biological knowledge multiplied by Computing power multiplied by Data equals Ability to Hack Humans.\nAlgorithm could help you choose a better movie that you might like than you could, decide what to do based on mood, what to buy, which career to choose, etc. Human feelings are shaped by survival and reproduction a million years ago but it is not the case with AI/Algorithms.\nThe author says that knowledge of Philosophy will be in great demand since the algorithms need it to make basic decisions to create more complex ones.\nDigital dictatorship is more dangerous than any dictatorship that we’ve seen in the past. Stalin didn’t possibly know or have control over normal citizens. But AI could know about every single citizen. Big Data algorithms might extinguish liberty and also might simultaneously create the most unequal societies that ever existed.\nChapter 4: Equality\nThe rise of liberalism and increase in globalization in the 1900s promised a more egalitarian society than all the centuries in the past put together. People in India and Egypt could enjoy the same opportunities and privileges as Finland and Canada!\nBut in the 2000s, the trend is changing. Wealth seems to be getting concentrated with the 1%. The richest 100 people own more than the poorest 4 billion people!\nWith the rise of AI and breakthroughs in biotechnology, the divide could get larger and impossible to reduce. Rich people in the past could buy more possessions or live in grandeur. The average rich person was not more intelligent than an average poor person. But now, they could soon have the ability to extend life, have more brain capacity, be more beautiful. The rich might become a set of superhumans who are like gods. This would result in the separation of humankind into a small class of superhumans and a massive underclass of ordinary Homo sapiens. Similar to Greek mythology!\nAs the superhumans evolve to a different species, they might choose to wall themselves off widening the inequality.\nIn the 21st century, data will eclipse land and machinery as the most important asset. The race to control more data is already on with all the big corporations vying for more control. At the moment, ordinary people are more than willing to give away their personal data. In a battle between privacy and health, health is likely to win. But that is fraught with so many dangers even leading to people losing their liberty. But there is no way to ensure private ownership of data at the moment. A technology innovation in that area is very necessary.\nPart II: The Political Challenge\nChapter 5: Community\nIn response to the growing nationalist sentiments after the 2016 elections, in 2017, Mark Zuckerberg published an audacious manifesto on the need to build a global community and that Facebook’s mission was to take this on. Breakdown of human communities was lamentable and Facebook could help people join meaningful communities online. Harari says that “finding meaningful communities and also strengthening our social fabric to bring the world closer together”, is more ambitious than even self-driving car. The goal is timely and noble.\nBut as more and more people live online, they are losing touch of their body, how it feels. People could listen to birds, know if a snake was in the grass by listening to the rustling, but now those skills are going away since people mostly are on their cellphones. People disconnected from their bodies are likely to feel alienated and disoriented. The time and energy you spend in communities online to connect with people across the world will be at the expense of your body, your family and your next door neighbors.\nChapter 6: Civilization\nHarari says that there is only one civilization in the world now. “The West” and the “The Muslim World”, “The East”, etc. may seem different but they are all operating under the same guidelines of modern civilization. Humans in the past were divided into isolated civilizations but not anymore.\nHe gives example of Olympics, it was probably inconceivable to conduct Olympic games at an international level 1000 years back but now it is possible.\nAnother example is medicine. In the past, people in different places were treated differently accordingly to the local belief systems or superstitions. But now, it is mostly identical. People use the same proven scientific approaches and believe in cells and bacteria.\nChapter 7: Nationalism\nNationalism was and is needed for people to support large systems. Harari gives the example of tribes along the Nile river. A tribe or a small group could have easily perished in a famine if multiple tribes hadn’t come together as a nation to help build dam along the Aswan or other infrastructure to feed a large number of people.\nNationalism is actually not in the DNA of a Human. People might prefer to feed their immediate family rather than pay taxes to feed millions of unknown but still they do it. They believe in the propaganda and flag-waving and the feeling of shared history.\nThe problem starts when benign patriotism morphs into chauvinistic ultranationalism. Instead of believing that your nation is unique, if you believe that your nation is supreme and you will be blindly loyal to do whatever it takes to exert its superiority, your thinking is muddled and you’ve declared war. Reminded of Gandhi’s quote - “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.”\nEconomic Challenge - Harari points out that extreme isolationism is completely divorced from economic realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national economies will collapse.\nNuclear Challenge - As more nations have nuclear power, without a robust system of international cooperation, there is no way to protect the world from nuclear destruction.\nEcological Challenge - Without international cooperation of multiple countries, the disastrous effects of global warming cannot be prevented.\nTechnological Challenge - With the rise of biotechnology, if there is no globally accepted ethical guidelines, it could be open season for Dr. Frankenstein.\nThe take away - “In order to take good care of your compatriots, you must cooperate with foreigners. So good nationalists should now be globalists.”\nChapter 8: Religion\nEven in the 21st century, truly secular people are a minority. Billions of people still ardently profess belief in Christianity, Hinduism or Islam. But are they really helping solve the problems of today? In many places, religion is part of the problem of humanity and not the solution, it seeks to divide people and not unite, which is very unfortunate since, of all the ideologies that Homo Sapiens have had over the last millions of years, religion is probably the best unifying force.\n3 types of problems in the 21st century\n\n\nTechnical problems - Agriculture/Medicine - How should farmers deal with severe droughts caused by global warming? If someone is very sick, should he/she be taken to a hospital or a religious place? Religious authority has dwindled in medicine and farming because people don’t associate religion with those anymore.\n\n\nPolicy problems - Economics - For questions like raising taxes, signing tariff agreements, grant authority to AI to make decisions about people’s lives, etc., people/govts turn to Economists and other modern financial theory. Does religion have much to contribute to the great policy debates of our time?\n\n\nIdentity problems - Even in the 21st century, religion gets to define who is ‘us’ vs ‘them’. Many religions use it to divide people. The right approach probably is to adapt religion to new realities to unite people. Harari gives example of Japanese people having reinvented Shintoism.\n\n\nChapter 9: Immigration\nAs he said earlier, “Humans vote with their feet”. World is more connected than ever and immigration is a reality. Harari views immigration as a deal with 3 basic conditions or terms -\n\nThe host country allows the immigrants in.\nIn return, the immigrants must embrace at least the core norms and values of the host country, even if this means giving up their traditional norms. “When in Rome, be Roman”\nIf immigrants assimilate, over time, they become ‘us’ than ‘them’.\n\nThere are always people in both camps. pro-immigration as well as anti-immigration. It is mostly a socio-economic issue. Many countries turn a blind eye to illegal immigration since they want to benefit from cheap labor of young foreigners. But they refuse to legalize the status, thus creating a society of upper class citizens who exploit powerless foreigners.\nImmigration also depends on the cultural make up of a country. Some countries are more tolerant and have mechanisms in place to assimilate them. For e.g. German culture in the twenty-first century is more welcoming of immigrants than Saudi culture. So a Syrian refugee might actually prefer to flee to Germany and not to Saudi.\nHarari illustrates the cultural differences using an example of fictional Coldians and Warmlanders.\n2 points to remember -\n\nIt would be wrong for any government to force large scale immigration on a local population if they are unwilling.\nThough people might oppose immigration, they should realize that they have an obligation towards foreigners.\n\nPart III: Despair and Hope\nChapter 10: Terrorism\nSince 9/11, terrorism has killed around 25,000 people. In contrast, traffic accidents killed 1.25 million people, diabetes killed 3.5 million people and air pollution 7 million people. Terrorists kill few people but instill fear on billions and rattle big governments.\nHarari says that terrorists are like a fly that wants to destroy a china shop. But the fly is weak and has no power to even move a single cup. What does it do? It goes into a bulls ear and starts buzzing. The bull destroys the china shop!\nChapter 11: War\nIn the past, war was the way of the world, the way to get more land and more manpower. But in the present, war is expensive, and countries that have not gone to war have prospered better.\nHuman stupidity is one of the most important forces in history, yet we often tend to discount it. One potential remedy for human stupidity is a dose of humility. National, religious, and cultural tensions are made worse by the grandiose feeling that my nation, my religion, and my culture are the most important in the world. People need to realize their true place in the world.\nChapter 12: Humility\nThe truth is, everyone claims superiority. People are brainwashed from a young age to believe that their group, their religion is the center of the world. The key thing to remember is that the world is large and humans have created hundreds or religions. When we see things in the right perspective, you automatically become humble.\nChapter 13: God\nHarari says that you don’t need to necessarily believe in God to be moral. If you believe in not causing suffering to another human being or reducing the suffering of others, that would suffice.\nWould a human really care about another person’s misery? Most probably yes, people are social animals and their happiness depends to a large extent on the relations with others. So the belief in not causing suffering to another human is at the core of our existence and doesn’t need belief or fear of God to be so.\nReligious belief can create compassion and kindness in people but it can also stoke anger against people who do not follow their belief system.\nChapter 14: Secularism\nSecularism is a positive and active worldview. It is not opposed to religion. In fact, the core of most religion are secularist principles. Secularism views morality and wisdom as the natural legacy of all humans, not something handed down from God to a specific set of humans at a point in time.\nThe Secular Ideals -\n\nCommitment to truth\nCompassion\nCommitment to equality\nCherish Responsibility\n\n“Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.”\nPart IV: Truth\nChapter 15: Ignorance\nIndividual humans are pretty ignorant of their world. We rely mostly on the expertise of others whether we acknowledge it or not.\nMost of people’s views are shaped by communal groupthink rather than individual rationality, and they hold on to these views due to group loyalty. Stating facts to convince someone might actually backfire. True especially for superstitions people.\nHarari talks about how power acts like a blackhole that warps the spacetime around it. Leaders are trapped in it. They have the best knowledge at their disposal but might not be able to leverage it since people might say the right things other than flattery due to the lack of time.\nChapter 16: Justice\nAccording to Harari, there is injustice all around the world and most people live on being ignorant of the part that they are playing. What if the phone that I bought was created by child laborers? What if the company that I invested in and gives me 5% returns is involved in dumping toxic waste that kills sealife? What if the sugar that I’m having for tea results in slave trade across the world?\nThe world is so complex and interdependent that only the ignorant can judge and blame other. One could be abetting a crime just by sitting at home.\nChapter 17: Post-Truth\nWe’re now living in a tragic world of fake news. There is no real way of separating truth from fake news. Propaganda and disinformation is nothing new. It existed in the past - Japanese army created the fake country of Manchukuo to legitimize its conquests, China has long denied that Tibet ever existed as an independent country, British settlement in Australia was justified by the legal doctrine of terra nullius (“no one’s land”), etc.\n“When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month, that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years, that’s a religion” !!\nHarari mentions that it is our responsibility to invest time and effort in uncovering our biases and in verifying our sources of information. Also, if you want reliable information, pay good money for it.\n“If you get your news for free, you might well be the product.”\nChapter 18: Science Fiction\nHarari says that in the 21st century, perhaps the most important genre is science fiction. It gets people excited (or fearful) about the future possibilities and also teaches about fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence more than what people try to read to find out. From that perspective, it is a great responsibility also. Sci-fi authors and movies can distort people’s views and give them bad ideas.\nHarari cites examples from Orwell’s 1984 and Huxley’s Brave New World.\nPart V: Resilience\nChapter 19: Education\nIt is more difficult than ever to predict the future. So we don’t know how things will be in 2050 and cannot really know what we should teach kids to prepare themselves for 2050. The schooling system has foundations in a past world when information was scarce and just knowing to read and write and getting the basics of geography, history and biology was a great improvement. But in today’s world, there is an information overload. So cramming information into kids is probably not the best use of time.\nWhat about teaching technologies that are important today - say coding in C++ or to talk Chinese? But after investing a lot of time in this, we might discover in 2050 that machines/AI can do this better than humans! What should the schools be teaching ? Experts agree on “the four Cs” — Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity.\nThe ability to constantly learn and reinvent yourself would be the key.\nChapter 20: Meaning\nDo we have a fixed ‘true’ identity that determines our duties in life? Is our purpose in life to find this identity and fulfill it? Simba the lion was born to eat antelopes and Arjuna the warrior was born to fight battles and if they don’t they are shunning the natural course of events in a Circle of Life. Are they? Harari goes through a few more worldviews and concludes that all stories are incomplete.\nIn order to give meaning to life, a story needs to satisfy 2 conditions -\n\nIt must give the individual a role to play.\nIt must extend beyond the individuals horizons (as religious stories extends to eternity).\n\nYou cannot leave anything meaningfully tangible behind. So you might be better off just helping someone else.\nHuman quest for meaning all too often ends with a succession of sacrifices - self or others.\n3 basic realities of the universe by The Buddha -\n\nEverything is constantly changing\nNothing has any enduring essence\nNothing is completely satisfying\n\nChapter 21: Meditation\nWas surprised to see Harari mention about Vipassana meditation course. I’d heard about it from AM who has been my colleague since 2011.\nHarari talks about his first experience with meditation and says that he learned more about himself and about humans in general by observing his sensations for those ten days than he had learnt in his whole life up to that point.\nHe meditates for 2 hours every day! Remarkable.\nHe concludes by saying that we have a choice to make an effort and investigate who we really are.\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-04-28---The-Great-Mental-Models,-Volume-1":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-04-28---The-Great-Mental-Models,-Volume-1","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-04-28 - The Great Mental Models, Volume 1.md","title":"The Great Mental Models, Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts by Shane Parrish","links":["General-Notes/People/Authors/Shane-Parrish"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Business","Philosophy","Mental-Models","book-notes","blog"],"content":"\n“The quality of your thinking depends on the models that are in your head.”\n~ The Great Mental Models, Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts1 by Shane Parrish &amp; Rhiannon Beaubien\n\nThoughts\nI was introduced to The Knowledge Project2 by AJ last year during one of our 1-1 walks around the campus. He sent me the link to Naval Ravikant’s podcast3 after the walk, and I listened to it in the bus on the way back home. It was one of the best podcasts that I had listened to and was totally taken aback. It was like listening to a philosopher.  I subscribed to the podcast and to the newsletter. One of the newsletters earlier this month spoke about the release of Volume 2 of The Great Mental Models. And I was like, wow, I haven’t even read the first volume. In order to be not left behind, I bought the kindle version of the books right away and started reading it.\nIt is a good read. But I think, it is one of those books where the hardcover would be better. Better formatted, with right things in the right pages. The book has many ‘sidebar’ anecdotes or snippets that are very interesting but break the flow of the current topic at hand. Also, sometimes a picture that a paragraph refers to, could be found a couple of pages later. A kindle book is great when the content is mostly just text and it flows continuously. Going by the pictures of the book pages on fs.blog4, looks like the hardcover would be a good buy. Probably will wait for all the books in the series to come out.\nWhat is a Mental Model?\nAs the book says, ‘A mental model is simply a representation of how something works.’ It is a way of looking at things and approaching problems that are presented to us. The chief goal in life, i.e if you want a comfortable life, is to have as few blind spots as one can. Either you work in a narrow area of your expertise or learn fast or try different things, you’re always consciously or unconsciously trying to figure out how to make tomorrow better than today. I feel that everyone has a mental model of what is needed to effectively do something. They are all probably smaller variations of some universal mental models. Knowing more, would enable us to think better and make informed decisions.\nThe book presents nine mental models as ‘general thinking concepts’. They are things that you’ve probably already heard of of know, but it is presented in a simple manner, with great quotes and memorable anecdotes.\nThe following are the mental models -\n\nThe Map is not the Territory\nCircle of competence (Supporting Idea - Falsifiability)\nFirst principles thinking\nThought experiment (Supporting Idea - Necessity and Sufficiency)\nSecond-order thinking\nProbabilistic thinking (Supporting Idea - Causation vs Correlation)\nInversion\nOccam’s razor\nHanlon’s razor\n\nNotes\n1. The Map is not the territory\nIn ‘The Map is not the territory’ the Authors outline that the ‘map’ is a miniature version of the land and not the land itself. Knowing the map can help navigate the terrain but only going on the terrain gives full understanding of the terrain. Maps are very useful since they abstract away a lot of complexities and information bloat. When we read news or a book summary, we’re reading abstractions created by other people who have condensed the information to smaller chunks to represent the actual information. The key issue with using maps is many times, we mistake map for the reality.\nIf I think of religion, I think though most religions have doctrines that are universal, many have rules that were written in the context of some particular scenario which has probably no relevance now. Map is useful only if we’re able to use feedback loops to update the map based on the changed terrain.\nThe chapter gives example of Newtonian physics and how it couldn’t explain interstellar phenomena that Einstein’s Special theory of relativity explains well.\nI didn’t quite understand if the sidebar on ‘Tragedy of Commons’ was cautioning against every person looking out to profit for themselves or not. Probably it means that if we’re working on a shared resource, the map becomes useless if everyone does things that doesn’t align with ‘sharing’ principle.\nIn order to use the map effectively, one must take 3 important considerations -\n\na. Reality is the ultimate update - The actual terrain may be different, map might have missed something.\nb. Consider the cartographer - The map maker might not be objective. What you might be seeing is one representation.\nc. Maps can influence territories - It is dangerous to fit complexity into simplification or extrapolate wrongly.\n\nThe chapter concludes by a short snippet about Frederick Taylor’s Scientific Theory of Management of breaking down tasks into smaller pieces and specializing people which worked great on the factory floor but had to be changed with time in different office settings. I couldn’t but wonder if Agile methodology is same as this!\n2. Circle of competence\nWhen one knows little, there is a sense of feeling of high confidence. The unknown unknowns are a lot. The chapter talks about a novice vs a lifer. A lifer is someone who has been in the place or industry for a long time and knows a lot of things about the domain. It would always make sense to get inputs from a lifer. To have a lifer as a mentor would be a great asset. Having sherpas as guides to climb Mt. Everest is a good example. A lifer/competent person knows what he/she doesn’t know and is able to make quickly and relatively accurately.\nAlso, even if you are an expert now, you should not operate as though the circle of competence is static. You must keep the knowledge updated. There are 3 key practices to build/maintain the circle of competence.\n\nWillingness to learn\nMonitor track record in areas that you have/want to have competence\nOccasionally solicit external feedback\n\n3 parts to successfully operate outside the circle of competence -\n\nLearn by basics while acknowledging that you’re a novice.\nTalk to experts\nUse a broad understanding of the basic mental models of the world to augment your understanding of the new field.\n\nThe chapter cites examples of Queen Elizabeth 1, Warren Buffet’s advice on not straying from the circle of competence.\nFalsifiability - If you can’t prove something wrong, you can’t really prove it right either. if you keep eliminating things that don’t work, you strengthen things that work (evolution example). Karl Popper, who propounded the theory of Falsifiability, also put forth another idea on our false notion of historicism. We use examples from the past to make definite conclusions about what is going to happen in the future. This is dangerous. Think of the worst events in history. We look at the worst in the past and prepare for that. But the future could be worse than the worst.\n3. First Principles Thinking\nThis is a way of breaking down any complex system or ideas into simple fundamental things, or building blocks. Once you see everything in terms of first principles, you’d be able to see how disparate things are connected. It is like taking apart a computer or a machine and putting it together. Once you’re able to do that you’re not only able to debug issues faster but also build new systems from the building blocks.\nTwo techniques - Socratic questioning and the Five Whys.\nSocratic questioning - disciplined questioning process, stops one from relying on gut and limits strong emotional responses.\nFive Whys - Determine the root cause of something by repeatedly asking ‘Why’. Each why is based on the previous answer.\nFirst principles thinking gives amazing results and innovative breakthroughs. E.g - H.pylori (stomach bacteria) discovery by Marshall and Warren, Curved carrier chute by Temple Grandin,First principles of meat, etc.\n4. Thought Expriment\nThought exeperiment is a technique wherein one uses imagination to think through things that are not in existence or are not available currently. Lot of philosophical ideas have been based on thought experiements.\nThe chapter examines 3 areas in which thought experiments are very useful -\n\n\nImagining physical impossibilities - e.g. Einsten’s theory of Relativity or the train and the platform example in Stephen Hawking’s ‘A Brief History of Time’.\n\n\nRe-imagining history - This is one of my favorite things to think about thing. Love TV series like ‘The Man in the High Castle’, ‘Outlander’, ‘12 Monkeys’, ‘Battlestar Galactica’, ‘The Expanse’, etc. which dwell not only on alternate history but also possible futures.\n\n\nIntuiting the non-intuitive - A thought experiment allows us to verify if our gut instincts are correct or not.\n\n\nNecessity and Sufficiency -\n\nThe gap between what is necessary to succeed and what is sufficient is often luck, chance, or some other factor beyond your direct control.\n\nThe hard truth - There could be thousands of people who write well and are able to publish but everyone cannot be J.K Rowling. Talent and hardwork is necessary to become a published author but not sufficient to become J.K Rowling. The gap, is huge!\n5. Second-Order Thinking\nAlmost everyone can think of immediate consequences of doing something. But about the ripple effects? Second-order thinking is the ability think farther than immediate consequences. A lot of disasters in the world could be attributed to lack of second-order thinking.\nExample - During the colonial rule, The British wanted to reduce the number of poisonous snakes in Delhi and announced a reward for people who brought in dead snakes. People did. By growing more snakes to make money, they inadvertently increased the number of snakes!\nUse of plastics, smoking, bad city planning, overgrazing - there are too many examples of lack of thought when we look around the world.\n\nStupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results.\n~ Margaret Atwood\n\nWhat a quote !\nThe key think is to think forward as much as possible with all the information at hand. “Haste makes waste!“\n6. Probabilistic Thinking\nProbablistic thinking is to try to estimate the likelihood of an outcome by using data at hand. The whole world probably runs on Probablity! A self-driving car, a complex search algorithm, a Machine Learning model, they’re all using probability to produce an outcome that is most likely. The same is probably true of our minds also. The feedback loop is pretty great for our brains though. The success of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) is greatly due to it being modeled after neurons. Probablistic thinking avoids analysis paralysis and also waiting for ever for all the perfect data to be made available.\nThree important aspects that you need to be aware\n\nBayesian thinking / Conditional probability - When making uncertain decisions, it is always important to check prior conditions.\nFat-tailed curves - Beware of fat-tailed curves. They distort risk estimations. A small error is measuring the risk of an extreme event can mean we’re way off - by orders of magnitude, not 100 fold but 10,000 fold. I think the corona virus epidemic and the lack of preparation is a good example.\nAssymetries - How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% early? Almost never? How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% late? All the time? Or when you aim to get 25% returns on an investment, are you more likely to get 10% (-15) or 40% (+15) ?\n\n7. Inversion\nInversion is a technique to think from the opposite end of the problem. Flip the problem, think backward, start from the end rather than beginning, etc.\nThe chapter gives example of Edward Bernays’s revolutionary campaign to get women to smoke cigarettes. He approached by problem by imagining how it would be if smoking was already an accepted norm.\nIf you’re stuck with something, invert. Even if not stuck, it always helps to think from different angles.\n8. Occam’s razor\nThe simplest solutions are most likely to be the right ones. Simple explanations are more likely than complex ones.\nDavid Hume was very cautious about believing in miracles.\nVera Rubin was able to explain behavior of galaxies using the simpler theory of ‘dark matter’\n9. Hanlon’s razor\nA lot of things that we attribute to malice might be more easily explained by stupidity or laziness. Brings me back to the earlier quote from Margaret Atwood - “Stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results.”\n\nBook cover Image Credit: Amazon\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\n\nParrish, Shane, et al.

Today, it is headed in another.”\nWas super glad to see Cloud Atlas as one of the books in Bill Gates’s reading list for this summer. I bought the book back in 2013 but haven’t read it yet.\nI still remember the first time I saw a trailer for the movie Cloud Atlas and being amazed and speechless. It was probably one of the best trailers I’d seen and the concept of interwoven lives and people being connected across generations really appealed to me. The quote above, is one from the movie trailer and I can’t believe that the quote found its way to me at this point in time!\nI have always felt that the whole of humanity is bound in some way and that the people we encounter matter to us more than we give credit for. There are people that we’re happy to be with, people that we want to connect to, even if it is just for a chat, light up our days like no other, music that we hear for the first time and somehow feel that we’ve always known it.\nWe think that we’re the sum total of all the things that’ve learnt from childhood, and like climbing a ladder, we keep going up, growing up, with each new thing that we learn every minute. But we actually know more than what we’ve been taught or learnt on our own, more than what extrapolations of data accumulated in our minds can explain. Where did that extra knowledge come from?\nI’ve seen the movie a couple of times and probably will see it again. It is a sci-fi movie as well as historical fiction with stunning visuals and great acting. Hope to read the book this year.\nHere is a another memorable quote from the Book/Movie.\n“A half-finished book is, after all, a half-finished love affair.”"},"Blog/2020/2020-06-01---Position-or-Knowledge":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-06-01---Position-or-Knowledge","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-06-01 - Position or Knowledge?.md","title":"Position or Knowledge?","links":[],"tags":["blog"],"content":"For the past few years, I have read quite a few materials on cybersecurity. In 2017, my professor at SJSU asked me to write a paper on IoT Security and Machine Learning techniques used to protect IoT systems. That was really interesting. Learnt about IoT, Fog Computing, Privacy and Security issues with IoT systems during that time. Since then, I’ve spent a few hours on the weekends on this topic, did a Coursera course, some readings as part of SCW (Secure Code Warrior) and beat CTF competitions. I was even thinking of enrolling in the Cybersecurity Bootcamp at Berkeley. But there was never time. There was always a burning issue in the to-do list that was past due.\nWhat if there is a question about continuing in the same domain and possibly growing to a higher position or trying to learn something new? I could divide my 18+ years of experience after B.E. graduation as\n\n8 years of Payments (6 yrs at PayPal, 2 years at ebay PGW/Billing, some experience with CC Transaction Processing system before that)\n8 years of e-commerce (at ebay)\na couple of years in misc domains (Healthcare, Insurance).\n\nIf you had a finite number of working years, say 40, would you pack it with one domain or multiple? The answer probably is different for different people. Of course, a domain like Payments is a mansion with a lot of rooms. A lifetime is not enough to cover all the payment processing schemes and rails. But for a Computer Scientist, a domain is another problem space that needs the right software tools.\nSomeone in the past had asked me to do this Thought Experiment when confronted with the question of this or that - “If you had all the money that you wanted, what would you do?“. In this case, I would definitely say, time to learn something new. I think the idea of learning something new or doing the same thing in a new way, appeals to people at a fundamental level. In small or big ways, everyone is an inventor. Invention is at the heart of being human.\nThough knowledge wins hands down, most of the time, the biggest inertia for a job change is always the people. The people  you work with have become your friends and like extended family, especially if you’ve pulled off a project or two that had extremely tough deadlines, debugged several hairy bugs together or brainstormed and argued about the design of new systems, etc. It is the people that make work enjoyable, they are the loved ones that have your back. But the best way to expand your friend circle is also to charter into new domains to forge new fellowships and be a bridge between different circles of your friends.\nNevertheless, the greatest work is one that is enjoyed and done with the heart’s content.\nAnd what is it to work with love?\nIt is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart,\neven as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.\nIt is to build a house with affection,\neven as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.\nIt is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy,\neven as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.\nIt is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,\nAnd to know that all the blessed dead\nare standing about you and watching.\n~ Kahlil Gibran"},"Blog/2020/2020-06-03---Catalyst-of-Change":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-06-03---Catalyst-of-Change","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-06-03 - Catalyst of Change.md","title":"Catalyst of Change","links":[],"tags":["blog"],"content":"Thankfully most of the demonstrations across the U.S. today were peaceful.

He has become a symbol of a person who was set up for failure. Whatever he did or said could not have saved him. I was reminded of Tom Robinson from “To Kill a Mockingbird”. Mayella comes on to him, but he gets accused of rape. Atticus proves that Tom could not have hit her on her right cheek since his left hand was injured. But the jury convicts Tom and sentences him for execution. The hopelessness of knowing that once you’re caught in the crosshairs of one or more prejudiced people, there is no escape. This once incident made people sit back and think about thousands of small instances where bigotry and prejudice won.\nIs there a solution? Doesn’t this happen everywhere in the world? In many ways, big and small, humans are hurting each other and it feels sad. Aren’t all the 7+ billion people in the world part of the same species who are similar 99.9% to each other? But the U.S. is expected to be above other countries. It is a beacon of hope for the whole world, a country that was founded on the principle of equality, a status that others aspire to get to.

I don’t quite remember who it was, but it was someone happy to see me with a book. That set me thinking.\nIt is great to be in this phase of life where I’m getting time to read and also, write a bit. I hope it lasts. Usually, when things are running smoothly, something happens that throws everything upside down and before long, years would have passed by. Anyway, it feels good to sit back and reminisce.\nChennai Days\nI was in Chennai for less than two years in my life, but from a reading standpoint, it was a tremendous period. Was lucky to be in the same team with 4 people I now refer to as “the philosopher quartet” - JC, MS, AH, and VS. They were well-read and used to discuss books often. VS was a real poet who penned poems in Tamil. Was introduced to Immanuel Kant, Nietzsche, J Krishnamoorthi, Bertrand Russel, and many authors during this period just by listening to them chat with each other. I believe that it was a stroke of luck that I was even placed in that team as my first job. Specific books that I recall right now are Robert Persig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Hemingway’s Old Man and the Sea recommended by MS, Arthur C Clark &amp; Isaac Asimov novels by AH and Who moved my Cheese and a few other business books by JC. AH gave me Arthur C. Clark’s Rama II as a gift when I left Chennai.\nOther groups of friends were folks outside my team - few people who were in my class during the 3 month orientation where we were given a crash course of CS topics, my roommates, and friends of these people. I developed great admiration for people from TKM and CUSAT (engg colleges in Kerala) due to the interaction with these folks. PS was in my class and was a big Harry Potter fan. She had forwarded a pdf/text of the first book, and I had liked the book a lot. AN was my junior and was from Bangalore. As Bangaloreans were ‘foreigners’ in Chennai, I used to connect with b’lore folks just to chat. He was a big fan of The Lord of The Rings. When we used to meet in the hallways of Elnet/Tidel, he would talk at length about the story and it was pretty entertaining. I’d credit PS and AN for my interest in fantasy novels.\nAnother great influence on my reading during that time was DT. She was PS’s friend and also was in my roommate RV’s team, I think. She was a great fan of English classics. I think I read most of Thomas Hardy’s novels during this period: Hardy - The Return of the Native, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Far from the Madding Crowd, Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Under the Greenwood Tree. Also remember reading George Eliot - The Mill on the Floss &amp; Silas Marner. I think I read Adam Bede after I came to the US. Her favorite books were Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women and Three Men in a boat by Jerome K Jerome. She introduced me to Somerset Maugham and AJ Cronin. Maugham’s Of Human Bondage and Cronin’s The Keys of the Kingdom were great reads. I read Keys of the Kingdom at a time when I was contemplating becoming a priest.  My goal was to work for a few years, get some personal things taken care of, and get into seminary. I did research a few places but wasn’t sure how to get into. Also was waiting for a ‘sign’ that never came! Erich Segal’s Doctors was another of DTs recommendations. Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code and Leon Uris were my roommate RV’s recommendations. VV was another close friend of mine and he was a big fan of Thoreau. He used to speak at length about Walden.\nWell, at the outset, it seems like I read only the books from people’s recommendations. That is true for the first books of many authors. But usually ended up reading more from the same authors and also did pay it forward by recommending the same with new folks that I met along the way.\nNow that I think of it, I probably could go back to my earliest memories to see what I read when. Most of the books that I’ve read have some person or incident attached to it. It is the question of remembering.\nPrimary School\nOne of the first novels I remember reading is The Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. I got this book as a prize for getting the first rank in 5th std. I remember reading the whole book but not understanding it much. I probably read a few times without understanding, I think. I actually understood the story only after I read an abridged version. Another book that I remember reading during that time is Oliver Twist. My mother probably had to study some of Dickens’ stories in school. She had a high regard for Dickens and her advise was that I stick to reading only biographies or stories by Dickens, and so wasn’t quite happy that I was reading a lot of fiction in high school.\nI do remember reading a lot of Tinkle, Amar Chitra Katha during this time. Probably got them from Krishna or Joe or other friends in the neighborhood. Read Balarama and Balamangalam, mostly with BS. My uncle had a lot of books in Kerala, and when we visited during summer holidays, I used to spend a lot of time reading. Remember reading Ithihyamala (Garland of legends/myths), Greek Purana Kathasagaram (Greek Ancient Stories), and 1001 Arabian Nights. Got really interested in mythology - Indian as well as Greek during this time. Almost all of my mythology reading, in the initial days, were in Malayalam. Can’t believe that I read the stories of Zeus, Ulysses, Achilles, etc. first time in Malayalam.\nAnother group of my readings during primary &amp; high school days were novels from Malayala Manorama weekly. Used to read it stealthily most of the time, though. Josy Vagamattom, Joisy, Ettumanoor Sivakumar, Kottayam Pushpanath were my favorite authors. At least the ones that I remember now after 20 odd years. It used to be serialized, in which only a part of the story would be published every week and most of them always ended on a cliff-hanger at the end. One was left waiting for next Wednesday to come! Josy Vagamattom wrote thrillers which had many fights - I remember Dravidan and a hero named Noble. Not sure if Noble was the hero in Dravidan or it was someone else. Joisy wrote poignant family dramas - I remember Ila pozhiyum shishiram in which a man comes back home from Gulf war after 5 years in captivity and finds that his wife had married his best friend. Ettumanoor Sivakumar was a writer of horror stories that had manthravadam (magic), yakshi (lady vampire), powerful munis and what not! Kottayam Pushpanath wrote detective stories that had a lot of twist and turns.\nHigh School\nHigh school was a different world than what I was exposed to till that point. Most kids were reading Hardy Boys, Secret Seven, Asterix, and a few other books and comics that I’d never heard of. In terms of reading volume, I probably read the maximum during that time. Definitely more than 250 books. Just the Hardy Boys books were probably over 50, may be 100. Read most books of Agatha Christie, Jeffrey Archer, Sidney Sheldon, Robert Ludlum, Harold Robbins, Alistair MacLean, Jack Higgins, Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason) and so on. I think I was mostly reading Hardy boys in the 8th std. and suddenly jumped to reading [[Wilbur Smith]], Harold Robbins, Jack Higgins, etc. in the 9th. Sometimes I read a book a day and rushed through them so fast that I barely remembered anything other than the main plot points. We were also going through a tough time personally and the books were probably a good escape too. All the reading meant that I didn’t study as much as I did during primary school. From someone who used to be upset with anything less than 100/100 in primary school and used to check with my teachers when I got less marks, even half a percent less, I became ok with just getting 90% in high school. But it was also a good transition from memorizing every single word in a text book to understanding high level ideas from books. Jeffrey Archer’s Kane and Abel, Sydney Sheldon’s Rage of Angels, Alistair MacLean’s Guns of Navarone, Robert Ludlum’s Bourne series, were some of the best page turners that I’ve read, then and now. RR was a looming influence and like a guru to me throughout high school. A lot of the books that I read were books that he had read though he was far ahead in terms of vocabulary and comprehending difficult texts. Robert Ludlum and Jeffrey Archer were probably his favorites and mine too. The idea of starting with one of an author and reading through all of his/her books came during this time, I think.\nEngineering\nWhen I think of Engineering days, one book that stands out is Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I can’t recollect how I got the book. It was most probably from Viveknagar library. The curious thing is that the cover and the first couple of pages were not there. The torn book started with ‘Part 1 - Non-Contradiction’ and I thought the name of the book was ‘Non-Contradiction’! As I was studying during the day and taking tuitions for neighborhood kids in the evening and doing homework in the night. So there was not much time to read, but somehow did manage to read.\nI did read many English Classics during the time. Became a member of British Library with RA’s help and we used to visit the library many times. Re-read a few Agatha Christie books, a few Shakespeare books (not the plays but abridged versions which were written as stories). Discovered Antony Trollope while randomly surfing through books. I read a few of his books, but don’t remember any at the moment. I’d read A Tale of Two Cities in the past but read that again and found it to be the best book I’d ever read.\nAlso used to visit the Central library in Cubbon Park during those days. It was very close to UVCE and was the biggest library I had seen in my life. It probably is the largest library in the State even now. I was awestruck with the size every time I visited it. We had a very good library in the College but this was something else. Remember reading books on Kerala history from the library. Didn’t know that Malayalam was a young language and evolved as a result of combination of Tamil and Sanskrit. Also read more about our Church history, Christianity in Kerala, etc. Got a better understanding of Orthodoxy and the beginning of Christianity in Kerala in 52 AD when St. Thomas came. I think the average Orthodox Christian in Kerala knows history quite well due to our faction fight with the Syrian Patriarch. The ‘freedom’ fight has resulted in more awareness, otherwise, numbers could have gone down in every generation, with more of the diaspora moving on to new philosophies or identities.\nA Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking was a book that SN had read and I read it based on his recommendation. We used to have a lot of chat around space time and our place in the world itself. He was a follower of Ramanujacharya’s Dwaita philosophy. There are definitely many more books that I don’t recollect right now.\nWorking Days - India\nWhen CTS recruited us from Campus during 5th semester, there was a hope that the Bangalore office would become big enough. But 9-11 struck and we had to go to Chennai. Couple of years of work in Chennai and then a year or so in Bangalore were great in terms of reading. I already mentioned about Chennai days above. When I rewrite this piece, I’d probably write it in a chronological order. In B’lore, I read a few business and leadership books recommended by AN who was from IIM-A and was super wise. I was lucky that he was sitting next to me since he was not even in our team. AN and GG used to solve the crossword puzzle on the Hindu every day morning. I remember not being able to solve even one in the initial days and then slowly getting a hang of it and really loving it.\nWorking Days - US\nA lot of my time in the US has been this cloud of time where I did nothing other than work. Get up in the morning and immediately check if there were some issues or emails from APAC, work late in the night to deliver projects that had very tough deadlines, etc. In reality, it wasn’t like that every day but it seems like that. I’ve always been nostalgic about my time in India and it has always felt like there was no time.\nBut when I look back at the last decade, I have read many books. Most of my Software Engineering related reading happened in the last 15 years. Reminds me to create a section for Software / Computer Science related books in My Reading List.\nI remember reading a lot of poetry in the first couple of years. Was still in touch with friends from Chennai and Bangalore and we used to exchange poems even during Chennai days. Was even writing poems during that time. Emily Dickinson and Elizabeth Browning were my favorite poets I think. Shakespeare’s sonnets were a great read. So were other poets like William Blake, Rudyard Kipling, HW Longfellow, John Donne, Tennyson, Rumi.\nLongfellow’s The Arrow and The Song,  Shakespeare’s Sonnet 18 (Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day), Sonnet 116 (Let me not to the marriage of true minds),  John Donne’s No Man is an Island, Robert Frost’s Stopping by the woods, The Road not taken, and Mending Wall (Good fences make good neighbors), Kipling’s If, Elizabeth Browning’s How do I Love Thee, W.E Henley’s Invictus, William Blake’s The Poison Tree, Wordsworth’s I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud, Konstantinos  Kavafis’s Ithaca are poems that I’d recommend to anyone.\nIn 2007, AK, my wife, and I wrote a book of poems and called it Sycamore Tree. It might have had around 20-25 poems. Not published though. AK has gone ahead and written over 100 poems by now.\nAK is a more prolific reader than I am, and I’ve read many books after she has read them. Susan Cain’s Quiet comes to mind. She loves classics too. She has probably read Jane Eyre five-six times. I read Marquez - Of Love and Other Demons by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Dear Life by Alice Munro, and a few other books from her list.\nOne of my neighbors suggested reading Jonathan Stroud and I loved the three books in Stroud - The Bartimaeus Trilogy - The Amulet of Samarkand, The Golem’s Eye and Ptolemy’s Gate. Read Lockwood &amp; Co.: The Screaming Staircase while on a trip to Denver a few years back. It was a great experience. Took me back to the early days of reading Hardy Boys!\nA colleague had recommended **Neal Stephenson’s Stephenson - Snow Crash. Was astounded by that. Stephenson had pretty much predicted a lot of things way back in the 90s. Need to read more of Stephenson.\nLast two years were good in terms of being exposed to reading and books. MT runs an ‘Authors Series’ in the campus where Authors of books come and talk about their books. Just attending them and getting a gist of the books were great time spent. I have all those books in my bookshelf waiting to be read.\n\nNote - I will probably come back update this since more memories may come back in the future."},"Blog/2020/2020-06-07---Like-a-Psalm":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-06-07---Like-a-Psalm","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-06-07 - Like a Psalm.md","title":"Like a Psalm - Remembering Dostoyevsky","links":["blog/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/"],"tags":["book-notes","blog","Biography"],"content":"While I was walking down the memory lane yesterday, I remembered meeting RR in Chennai and his gift of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. We were best friends in school and I had lost touch with him during engineering. One day there was an email and he said he was in Chennai. We agreed to meet. It was either a Saturday or a Sunday. I used to teach Math for CAT students during the weekends. I had finished a class and met RR at Landmark (book shop) in a mall. It probably was Spencer’s but not fully sure. He gifted me this book and it was a great surprise. He used to give greeting cards in the past with some inspiring and soulful words written beautifully. Expecting him to have written something, I opened the book to find a quote among other wishes.\n“Obstacles are things you see when you take your eyes off the goal.” ~ Henry Ford\nNow that I think of it, Dostoyevsky was an author who I wanted to read but hadn’t read. My first introduction to Dostoyevsky happened probably during high school/PU days. Through a book named Oru Sangeerthanam Pole (Like a Psalm) by Perumbadavam. I think I read the book from Viveknagar library. The author called Dostoyevsky as Hridayathinu mel dhaivathinte kayyoppulla aal (A man who has God’s signature on his heart).\nI used to visit Viveknagar library often. It was a small government library which was close to the bus stand. It used to open in the morning, close in the afternoon and open in the evening around 5. Many times, I used to wait for the libarian to come. There were few other people also waiting, usually to read newspaper or magazines. Since it was a govt library, there were books in all languages - many in Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, etc. I had read most of the English books that were available. Moreover our school had a bigger library with lot more choices. There was a small section of Malayalam books - probably around 20-30 books. I’d read a few of them in the library. Kanam and Parappurath are two authors I remember. I had heard of Dostoyevsky for the first time from one of the books I read during this time.\nOru Sangeerthanam Pole is about Dostoyevsky’s relationship with Anna, his stenographer. It describes him as a person anyone would hate. He was a drunkard, gambler, lonely and depressed. He has a deadline to write a novel but had not started even a single page. I was thinking that someone like him may not make it anywhere in India. The society, in general is very intolerant of people who drink.\nThe connection between Russia and Kerala itself is something to think about. How did Communism make its way to Kerala? How is there a Communist party which is Leninist. Saw a movie couple of years back called Comrade In America (CIA) where the protagonist has a chat with Che Guvera, Marx and Lenin during a difficult time. Anyway, the Russia connection is something to read about for a later time.\nI feel like I need to read Oru Sangeerthanam Pole and Crime and Punishment again. Last year I read a book named 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson. Peterson refers to Dostoyevsky multiple times in his book. Of course, he talks more about Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago but he was a big fan of Dostoyevsky and urges us to read his books.\nPhoto of the quote\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-06-09---The-Goal":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-06-09---The-Goal","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-06-09 - The Goal.md","title":"The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement by Eliyahu M. Goldratt & Jeff Cox","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Business","Leadership","Self-Help","Management","book-notes","books","blog"],"content":"The book is about Alex, a plant manager who is in the middle of a very difficult situation. Everything seems to be falling apart. Shipments are always late, backlog is growing, factory is bleeding money though every single person is working hard all the time. The VP comes to the factory and asks about an order that is seven-weeks overdue. He goes into the factory floor and asks folks to stop everything and work on the order that he wants to be done. He yells at the machinist and he quits. The VP tells the manager that the order has to go out today no matter the cost. Also that the factory is running so badly that it will be shut down in 3 months. The manager goes on the floor and finds out that the machinist who quit earlier, is crucial to get the work done fast! To add to all this, his wife is completely upset with him since he is mostly at office and does not give enough time to the family. Tonight he was supposed to take his wife out and it turns out to be an allnighter to deliver an order that VP has asked for. Phew!\nIf anyone thinks that this is a far fetched scenario, I assure you that it is not. It is a day-to-day reality at most of the tech companies, especially the ones on the cutting edge, not to mention Startups. As someone who worked at online companies for the last 15 years, close to a decade at ebay and six years at PayPal, this situation is all too familiar to me. Of course, it depends on the team and role but an online company is 24/7 and unanticipated issues can happen anytime. With SRE on your back and a lot of people asking questions, you could hear the collective heartbeat of the executive team and also\nthe sound of money going down the drain, when there is a production P0 at hand. Impacting the livelihood of merchants is another thing that would spring you to action.\nBut the story is not a sombre one. Alex, the plant manager is able to get out of the trouble. He makes a remarkable turnaround and posts profits every month and delivers orders ahead of time. He also wins back the love of his wife and gets time to spend with his kids.\nAll because he gets a chance to present his problem to his professor in the past and the professor, a wise man, asks a series of great questions. The questions get Alex thinking and he finds solutions by working with his team. The key inputs are the questions raised by the ‘Yoda’ professor, Jonah.\nWhen one is close to the ‘factory’, one tends to dismiss theoretical scientists as moutain-top hermits who are not close to code and don’t know the realities. But the book proves that for critical thinking, one doesn’t have to be working at the lathe, one could as well be outside and observe the workings to analyze what is wrong. This is what Jonah does.\nThe biggest takeaway from the book was that one needs to be clear about what the Goal is. The goal of a company is to make money. Increase throughput, reduce inventory and reduce the operation expenses. Look at the whole operation and find out bottlenecks, reduce bottlenecks to improve throughput. The key thing is to sell quality products which could translate in software terms to ‘ship code’.\nPlanning makes all the difference. The team is able to deliver a sudden order of 1000 parts without overworking or spending time in the weekends because they do things in a methodical manner.\nOverall, it is a great book and I’m so glad that someone recommended this to me. For new managers, it might help them be better managers, for existing managers who are finding it tough to juggle all the balls in the air, it would offer hope - to think, to look for new solutions, and be optimistic. The best thing is, it is a business book that is written as a story, a thriller, where you’re turning the next page to find out what happened!\n\nThe Goal on Amazon - The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement"},"Blog/2020/2020-06-20----Zero-Trust-Networks":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-06-20----Zero-Trust-Networks","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-06-20 -  Zero Trust Networks.md","title":"Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks by Evan Gilman, Doug Barth","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Information-Technology","Cybersecurity","book-notes"],"content":"Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks 1st Edition1\nThoughts\nThere is no better time to read this book than now.

This post is in response to that. First some context on what we’ve been doing.\nBackground\nWife read the post on Oru Sangeerthanam Pole and really got fascinated by Perumbadavam and Dostoyevsky. She got busy reading articles on Dostoyevsky and Perumbadavam and also a couple of Perumbadavam’s interviews on Youtube. I joined in, and we watched a few interviews together. Other than reading the famous book accidentally, I didn’t know much about the man himself. What comes across through the interviews is the portrait of a humble, down-to-earth, emotional person. He definitely is an incredible human being. The interview with Shiny Jacob in a Church was great. An interview done by Rayson Kuriakose on the bank of a river, was also very touching.\nAK also started reading ‘The Brothers Karamazov’. Just the past week, she was reading an essay by Turgenev about an execution in Paris. Now that I think of it, she told me about Turgenev’s essay, and that’s probably when I remembered that I had a copy of ‘Crime and Punishment’, looked it up and remembered how I happened to get the book and how I got to know about Dostoyevsky. Ah, many times, it is great to unravel why we got into something; Why did we start reading that particular book?, Why did we start watching a specific TV series or a movie?, Why did we start talking about a topic that we never touched upon for years?, etc. While talking to her after writing the post, I was a bit confused about when I actually read ‘Oru Sangeerthanam Pole’. It might have been at Viveknagar library as I mentioned in the earlier post. It might also have been at Babuchan’s house. Or it might have been in Manorama weekly. What I clearly remember are the black and white illustrations of specific scenes on some pages. I’ve always been fond of illustrations in books since they reveal a lot. It is also a chance to check where in the book that scene occurred.\nWe also got talking about our interest in Russian literature and how unbeknownst to us, it was an influential force. It might have been through movies or friends or other connections. That too, we both are Malayalis who grew up outside Kerala. If we had grown up in Kerala, the influence might have been higher. Realized that the village bordering Tengana, the place where we have a home in Kerala, is named Moscow! Haha. Yes, we have visited Moscow in Kerala.\nAnyway, here are some articles that I was able to lookup on Google about Kerala’s connection with the Soviet Union, especially with literature.\nArtiles on Kerala-Russia connection\n\nKerala’s Love Affair with Soviet Literature by Maya Palit. Oct 6, 2016.\n\n\nShe starts with the story of how here uncle gifted her books by Russian author Lyudmila Petrushevskaya and how she found the stories very relatable. Then she talks about the success of Oru Sangeerthanam Pole in the 90s, and about the docu-fiction film In Return — Just a Book, based on the novel, directed by Shiny Jacob and scripted by the famous writer, Paul Zacharia.\nShe mentions that though Communist thought entered Kerala and began taking root in the 1930s and 40s, it was in the 50s that Russian literature was introduced to the public.\nKesari Balakrishna Pillai was one of the initial people to bring Russian translations to the common people. He started with translations of Chekhov’s books and published through Kesari, a periodical that he ran.\nIn 1952, Prabhath Book House got the rights to import Russian books. The books, especially the periodicals, were heavily subsidized by the Sovient Union and they cost only Rs. 2 or 3.\nNK Damodaran’s was the first to translate Dostoevsky’s works from English to Malayalam.\nShe mentions that the real harbinger of Russian literature in a massive way, was a man named K ‘Moscow’ Gopalakrishnan. In 1966, the Soviet government decided to publish Russian writings in Malayalam. They invited Gopalakrishnan, who was the joint editor of the ‘Soviet Review’ in Delhi at the time, to Progress Printers in Moscow. He and his wife Omana Gopalakrishnan, translated close to 200 Russian books into Malayalam, including Party literature, folk tales, the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin etc.\nMaya quotes author KR Meera saying “The children of the 70s were shaped more by the Soviet Union than India.”\nMaya talks about friends who remember their introduction to Dostoevsky, Gorky and Tolstoy through Malayalam publications, which by all accounts, were very colorful, printed on great quality paper, beautifully-produced and really cheap. Also talks about children’s magazine named ‘Sputnik’.\nShe quotes KR Meera saying that Russian literature was everywhere, that before brown paper came along, they used to cover notebooks for school with the glossy paper from Soviet Land magazines!\nShe ends with a note that Kerala’s lyublyu (love) for Russian literature appears to have tempered down and that the new generation definitely has missed out. I agree.\n\nOther articles of interest are below. Will summarize in a few days.\n\n\nHow a Malayali couple brought Russian literary magic to Kerala by Ajay Kamalakaran.

The Mayor of Casterbridge remains my favorite since it kind of resembled a Bollywood movie when I read it.\nHardy was not just a writer who wrote a story. He was a history buff, a traveler, an expert in birds and plants, a biblical scholar, and more importantly, a philosopher who understood human nature very well. I felt that he put in all his knowledge into the book in order to teach, and the story was just a small part of it.\nThere are a lot of references to Greek mythology throughout the novel. References to Artemis, Athena, Prometheus, Scylla and Charybdis, Zeus, Olympus, Tantalus, Ulysses, Aeneas, etc. pop up in many places. Reading these references took me back to a time when I read ‘Purana Kathasagarangal’ a book of stories from Greek mythology.\nAlso, a lot of biblical references are found throughout. Different quotes and references from the Gospels, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Book of Samuel, Judges, etc. are found in different places. Was surprised by references like - comparison of watchman recognizing Ahimaaz’s gait from afar to Mrs. Yeobright recognizing Clym’s gait, Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams to that of Eustacia’s, destruction of Sennacherib’s army, and so on.\nHe refers to history of UK (Guy Fawkes, Mary Queen of Scots) , USA (Virginia, War of Independence), Greece (Alexander the Great), India (there is a reference to Begum and Warren Hastings), and so on.\nDetailed descriptions of birds, places, plants, sometimes using botanical names, references to Darwin, are astounding.\nAlso, there are so many philosophical insights about human nature that it is remarkable and thought provoking. For instance, he says that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity, that a well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer. It made me sit and think. Viewing someone as exceptional or godly is bad for the viewer and the person!\nOverall, it is a great read to understand many things. Though most people would read the book during their college days, I think it is best enjoyed after you have experienced many facets of human life - childhood, adolescence, marriage, children, jobs, after you have read enough history or seen enough movies/documentaries about different cultures in the world.\n\nNotes\nBOOK ONE THE THREE WOMEN\n1 - A Face on Which Time Makes but Little Impression\nMeaning of the title = Egdon heath is the face which has not changed over time.\nThe whole of the first chapter is an intriguing introduction to the landscape that the events in the novel are based on. It is a description of Egdon heath as a powerful force of nature, as nature itself. One can almost visualize the twilight as though one is right there. About the twilight he says, it is the time of the day where when a worker looks up, he might continue to work but when he looks down or around, he might feel like it is getting darker and is time to wind up. Hardy calls the heath as a wasteland that is vast and lonely. It has brown vegetation. But he goes on to say that is has been there since prehistoric times and has been unaltered as the stars above though everything around has changed over time. He contrasts it with the sea that is renewed frequently - ‘distilled by the Sun and kneaded by the moon’! The sea changed, the fields changed, the rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained. He gives an imposing persona to the heath.\n2 - Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble\nMeaning of the title = Reddleman appears with a woman (trouble) on his carriage. An old man who meets them on the way gets to know that there is a woman in the carriage and probably adds to the trouble.\nA old man with a walking stick, wearing an ancient boat-cloak (cloak worn by naval officers) is seen walking alone. He sees a van far away and catches up to it. It was that of a reddleman, a person who sells reddles to the villages. Reddles are red seeds that are used to mark sheep when they are sold in fairs. The trade makes the person who sells red since the pigment spreads on clothes and skin during handling.\nThe reddleman is not much of a talker but since he keeps going to the back of the van to check upon something, the old man inquires and is told that there is a lady. The old man tries to extract more information but cannot. They part ways when the reddleman says that his ponies need to rest.\nIt is getting darker and the reddleman looks towards the horizon and sees a woman near the barrow on top of the mountain. After a short while, she goes away and more people come in.\n3 - The Custom of the Country\nMeaning of the title = Custom of the Country is to light a bonfire on the 5th of Nov.\nThis is a long chapter and there is a good amount of dialogue in it. After the first two chapters ended with no characters being named, here many are introduced.\nThe group that gathered around are children, men and women of the neighboring hamlets and they’ve come to light bonfires. Across the heath, you can see bonfires at different places and they’re doing it to celebrate some custom. Hardy says people have been lighting bonfires since ancient times of the Druids. Even if the reasons change, the custom remains.\n\nTo light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man when, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded throughout Nature. It indicates a spontaneous, Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat that this recurrent season shall bring foul times, cold darkness, misery and death. Black chaos comes, and the fettered gods of the earth say, Let there be light.\n\nThe people around the bonfire include Grandfer Cantle, his son Christian, Timothy Fairway, Humphrey, Sam, Susan Nunsuch, Olly Dowden. Grandfer is quite a jolly person who sings songs and dances. Christian is just over 30 yrs and says that no woman would marry him. The folks are quite superstitious and they say that he lacks virility since there was no moon when he was born. They also say that single sleepers are visited by ghosts.\nThey talk about the marriage of Thomasin Yeobright and Wildeve that was to happen earlier that day. They mean to go to Wildeve’s inn and sing a song later. The marriage was opposed by Thomasin’s aunt openly in the church and later she had agreed. They also mention that Mrs. Yeobright’s son Clym is soon returning and they seem to have an admiration for him. They look at a bonfire a bit faraway that is burning steadily and mention that it might be due to wood being used. They mention that it might be by Eustacia, Captain Vye’s granddaughter. They don’t speak favorably of her.\nThey dance as the fire dies out, Christian gets frightened when reddleman appears who has come towards them asking the way to Mrs. Yeobright’s house. A few minutes after the reddleman leaves, Mrs.Yeobright comes. She takes Olly and goes towards Wildeve’s Inn, The Quite Woman.\n\nPersons with any weight of character carry, like planets, their atmospheres along with them in their orbits.\n\n4 - The Halt on the Turnpike Road\nMeaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright halts to talk to Diggory Venn and finds out the bad news.\nMrs. Yeobright and Olly walk down the hill and when they reach the road Olly goes towards her home and as Mrs. Yeobright is about to enter the Inn, she sees a horse and a van nearby and the reddlemen walking alongside. She goes and talks to him to find out that her neice is no in Wildeve’s Inn but in the carriage, that she did not get married earlier in the day as expected. Thomasin gets down from the carriage, Mrs. Yeobright and she walk toward the Inn to confront Wildeve.\n5 - Perplexity among Honest People\nMeaning of the title = Probably indicates the surprise in the village folk who came to dance and found Thomasin inside and not outside with Wildeve\nShe says that if he promised to marry her, he must do it, otherwise, it would bring great shame to the family. Wildeve explains that it couldn’t happen because of an issue with licence. They had gone to Anglebury to register the marriage but since it was made out for Budmouth, it wasn’t useful in Anglebury. Thomasin tries to defend Wildeve. She says that she was upset and decided to come back by herself and not with Wildeve and that it was not his mistake. Wildeve promises that the marriage will happen in a couple of days.\nIn the mean time, the earlier group of people come to celebrate the wedding. Wildeve asks the Yeobrights to stay in the room while he goes to entertain. He gives them drinks and chats with them. They leave and when he comes back, he finds the Yeobrights to have already left by the open window at the back.\nHe looks outside and sees one bonfire still being lit and knows that it is a sign for him. He goes towards it.\n6 - The Figure against the Sky\nMeaning of the title = Figure against the sky that reddleman saw was Eustacia\nIn the chapter we learn that the old man who had spoken to reddlemen was Eustacia’s grandfather. He had put one-and-one together and informed Eustacia that probably the marriage didn’t happen. She lights the fire to signal Wildeve to come to her thinking that he called of the wedding in the last minute because of her.\nShe has asked Johnny Nunsuch, a boy in the neighborhood to tend to the bonfire and goes once in a while to the barrow to check on Wildeve’s Inn through a telescope and then comes back. She asks the boy if he heard a frog jump on the lake to which he replies no. Her grandfather asks her to come indoors and she says she will. After a while, the boy tells her that he heard a frog jump. She sends him off with a sixpence and we see Wildeve coming over after the boy leaves. He tells her that she does not give him peace with the lighted bonfire that does not die out. She tells that she is upset that he chose Thomasin over her. But that she is glad that he didn’t marry due to his love for her. Wildeve explains that it was no the case and it was due to a licence issue. But they continue to chat about their love for each other. She doesn’t allow him to kiss her though. He leaves and she goes to sleep.\n7 - Queen of Night\nMeaning of the title = Description of Eustacia as a Queen\nThis chapter is a detailed character sketch of Eustacia. She is described as exceptionally beautiful. Her father was a bandmaster in the navy and was lucky to have married the captain’s daughter. Her grandfather was not quite happy about it since he was from a noble family. Other aristocratic roots, comparisons to greek gods are also made. She is also portrayed as a very passionate person who has highly romantic notions in her head.\n\nFidelity in love for fidelity’s sake had less attraction for her than for most women; fidelity because of love’s grip had much. A blaze of love, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same which should last long years.\n\nThough she grew up in Budmouth, she is now at Edgon heath with her grandfather after he dad passed away. She hates being here and is always in expectation of something grand to happen.\n\nTo dwell on a heath without studying its meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue. The subtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia; she only caught its vapours. An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet, a suffering woman a devotee, a pious woman a psalmist, even a giddy woman thoughtful, made a rebellious woman saturnine.\n\n8 - Those Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody\nMeaning of the title = The boy Johnny finds Wildeve and Eustacia together and later stumbles upon Diggory Venn.\nThe boy Johnny Nunsuch is going towards his home happy with the money he got from Eustacia. On the way he gets frightened with something and decides to go back and ask Eustacia to lend a servant to walk back with him. But once he reaches there he finds Eustacia talking to Wildeve and he is caught in what Hardy calls as ‘Scyllaeo-Charybdean’ position (after rock and a whirlpool in greek mythology). He decides to not disturb them, musters courage and goes towards his home.\nOn the way back, he gets frightened of something and slips and falls near Diggory Venn. Venn asks him some questions and finds out about Wildeve meeting with Eustacia.\n9 - Love Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy\nMeaning of the title = Diggory Venn hatches a plan to eavesdrop on Wildeve and Eustacia.\nHardy explains that women used to scare their children by saying ‘the reddleman is coming for you’. He says that ordinary people don’t take up the trade though it is vanishing. Reddlemen are wanderers like gypsies but they look down upon gypsies. Sometimes people take up the reddle trade as a penance after some wrongdoing.\nVenn returns to his van and takes up an old letter to read. It is a letter from Thomasin where she explain why she couldn’t marry him. She does see him that way. Looks like the spurned marriage offer is what made Venn to leave his father’s dairy farming and go into reddle trade. He still cares for Thomasin and is upset and Eustacia and Wildeve are causing pain to her.\nSince the boy had told him that Eustacia and Wildeve had agreed to meet on the Rainbarrow, Venn goes there daily to see if they are. The first three days pass by withouth incident. The fourth day, he sees them meet. He hides in a nearby bush and manages to overhear the conversation. Wildeve wants Eustacia to go away to America but she does not say yes or no. They depart.\nVenn goes back to his van and decides to have a word with Eustacia.\n10 - A Desperate Attempt at Persuasion\nMeaning of the title = Diggory Venn tries to persuade Eustacia\nVenn goes to Mistover Knap first thing the next morning. He sees the grandfather at the entrance who offers him a drink. Venn says he is there to meet Ms. Vye. Since it is too early, he doesn’t get to meet in spite of waiting for some time. So he goes outside and waits while walking around. She comes after some time. He broaches the subject of Wildeve and Thomasin but she doesn’t take the hint. He then comes in the open an accuses her of the person who is holding the marriage by controlling Wildeve. He asks her to release Wildeve. She is shocked. But refuses by saying “he was mine before he was hers! He came back because he liked me best!“. Since he knows that she hates the heath, he even offers her employment in Budmouth through a reference from his uncle. But she still refuses.\n11 - The Dishonesty of an Honest Woman\nMeaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright tells Wildeve that she is going to give Thomasin to another suitor though she had said no to Diggory.\nAs Venn is walking back towards his van, he sees Mrs. Yeobright walking towards the Quiet Women to meet Wildeve. He goes over and talks to her. He doesn’t tell her why he thinks Wildeve may not marry Thomasin since he knows that Eustacia has him fully charmed. He proposes his hand in marriage. But Mrs. Yeobright doesn’t agree since Thomasin hadn’t agreed two years ago.\nWith this new information, Mrs. Yeobright goes into the Inn and talks to Wildeve. In order to force his hand, she says that Thomasin has another suitor who is ready to marry her. Wildeve is surprised. Contrary to what Mrs. Yeobright expected, he doesn’t commit.\nLater that evening, he goes to meet Eustacia and tells her that their path is clear since Thomasin has another suitor and that she is not interested in him anymore. Eustacia is shocked by this and almost immediately loses interest in him. “What was the man worth whom a woman inferior to herself did not value?”, she says to herself. She doesn’t commit and tells him that she will give a final answer on Monday at 8 by the Rainbarrrow.\nLater that night, her grandfather returns and tells her that Mrs. Yeobright’s son Clym Yeobright is coming home to spend Christmas with his mother. He is coming back from Paris where he had spent the last decade.\nBOOK TWO THE ARRIVAL\n1 - Tidings of the Comer\nMeaning of the title = Eustacia overhears news of Clym who is about to come to Egdon.\nOne day, late in the afternoon around 3 PM, Eustacia is standing in the kitchen near the chimney and she could hear men talking outside. The men would be Sam and Humphrey, the furze cutters, who are stacking up the furze, closely watched by Captain Vye. They’re talking about Clym as they do their work. They’re proud of him and hold him in high esteem. He is said to be working for a diamond merchant in Paris. After the captain leaves, they talk among themselves, saying that if there was anyone who was a match for Clym it was Eustacia.\nEustacia spends the whole afternoon daydreaming about Clym. Later in the evening, she decides to go and have a look at Yeobrights’ home.\n2 - The People at Blooms-End Make Ready\nMeaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright and Thomasin are getting ready for Clym’s arrival.\nMrs. Yeobright and Thomasin has busy preparing for Clym’s arrival, Thomasin is on the attic to gather apples. Both are talking as they do their work. After that, they go out to gather berries. Thomasin tells her aunt to not mention the marriage with Wildeve to Clym. Mrs. Yeobright again points out that Wildeve is not the saint that her niece thought to be. She also tells her about her dialogue with Wildeve where she mentioned about another suitor.\n3 - How a Little Sound Produced a Great Dream\nMeaning of the title = A little hello from Clym in the darkness sends Eustacia’s imagination wild.\nEustacia is near Blooms-End but does not see any motion or light there. As she is going back, she sees 2 women and a man coming on the way. As they reach nearer, she knows that the women and Mrs. Yeobright and her neice. The man says “Good Night”. Since it is darks, she is not able to hear him.\nShe thinks of the voice the whole night and has vivid dreams in the night. For the next few nights, she walks around the heath to catch a glimpse of him by some chance encounter but it doesn’t happen.\n4 - Eustacia Is Led on to an Adventure\nMeaning of the title = Eustacia dresses up as a Turkish knight to have a glimpse at Clym\nEustacia’s grandfather gives permission to the mummers to come and practice in his fuelhouse. Eustacia watches them practicing and comes to know that they are going to perform at Blooms-End on Monday night. She sees this as a great opportunity to see Clym since she was afraid that he might go away after Christmas. She influences Charley to take a break on the day when they’re going to play at Blooms-End and let her play the part diguising as someone else, instead. In exchange he gets to kiss her hand.\nCharley is one of the Egdon mummers for the present year, and he and the other mummers practice in Captain Vye’s house for the play “Saint George.” On the night they are to perform in Mrs. Yeobright’s house, Eustacia arranges to take Charley’s place in order to see Clym and study him in the guise of the Turkish Knight. Some of the boys recognize her.\n5 - Through the Moonlight\nMeaning of the title = The title is probably a nod to the band of mummers walking through the moonlight to Blooms-End to perform.\nMonday evening comes and as decided, Eustacia joins the mummers in disguise, goes over to Yeobrights’ home and plays the part.\n6 - The Two Stand Face to Face\nMeaning of the title = Eustacia and Clym meet face to face.\nEustacia rests after the play an surveys the room to look for Clym. She gets her chance to see him. When she sees him talking to Thomasin, she regrets having come in disguise thinking that in her natural form she could have charmed him. Mrs. Yeobright asks the mummers to stay for dinner and they’re happy. The mummers were not in a hurry to leave. So she goes outside to wait for them while watching the moon. Clym comes by and asks her if she were a women disguised as Turkish knight. She says yes but doesn’t reveal who she is. Having accomplished what she came to do, she doesn’t wait for others and goes home.\nWhile returning, Eustacia remembers that it is Monday night and she had an appointment with Wildeve to let him know her decision. But since the time has passed and she is no longer interested in him, she is now indifferent.\n7 - A Coalition between Beauty and Oddness\nMeaning of the title = Venn and Eustacia partner up to make Wildeve marry Thomasin.\nVenn meets with Eustacia and tells her that he saw Wildeve waiting at the Rainbarrow for a long time previous night. He is sure that Wildeve will go again tonight and tells her that he can take a letter to him if needed. Eustacia writes a letter saying that she is no more interested in Wildeve. Venn delivers the letter and Wildeve decides to marry Thomasin to make Eustacia suffer. The next day, Wildeve goes to Blooms-End and asks Thomasin. She accepts in order to protect the pride of her family.\n8 - Firmness Is Discovered in a Gentle Heart\nMeaning of the title = Thomasin, the gentle heart is firm this time on marrying Wildeve, before Clym is back, also not to have Mrs. Yeobright at the wedding so as to not embarass her.\nThomasin goes ahead with marriage. When Clym returns Mrs. Yeobright tells him the story. He feels sad and wants to attend the wedding. While he is on his way, he sees Diggory Venn who tells him that it is over. The person who gave the bride away was Eustacia Vye. This is the first time Clym hears about Eustacia.\nBOOK THREE THE FASCINATION\n1 - “My Mind to Me a Kingdom Is”\nMeaning of the title = Refers to Clym saying that his mind would be put to better use as a schoolteacher than as a clerk in a diamond shop.\nClym Yeobright was famous in the neighborhood from his childhood. He was a bright kid, people were in awe of him and began to always expect great things from him. Hardy mentions a quote by a Jesuit here → “It is bad when your fame outruns your means.”. Probably, the hype around him was greater than he could match. So, when he went to Paris to work, the expectation grew even higher.\nSo, when he says, during haircutting at Fairways, that he is leaving behind his excellent job in Paris and staying back at Egdon to start a school, people are surprised. They commend his good-heartedness but feel that he would learn things in a few weeks.\n2 - The New Course Causes Disappointment\nMeaning of the title = Clym’s mother is disappointed at his decision to leave behind a well paying job.\nHardy mentions that over-idealism and zealousness are not characters of a well-balanced mind.\n\nA well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer.\n\nHe goes on to say that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity.\nClym’s mother is shocked by his decision and tells him that everyone thinks of going forward in life and his decision is definitely a step backward. While they are discussing, Christian Cantle comes in and says that Susan Nunsuch had pricked Eustacia Vye in the church to verify if she were a witch. Eustacia had fainted. Clym’s curiosity is aroused and he wants to know more about Eustacia. He puts one and one together and wonders if Eustacia had come to his house disguised as a Turkish knight the other day. Sam says that few folks are going over to Captain Vye’s home later that day to retrieve a bucket that has falled into the well and he could get to meet Eustacia if he wants to.\n3 - The First Act in a Timeworn Drama\nMeaning of the title = People falling in love is a timeworn drama and the first chapter in Clym and Eustacia’s love affair happens here.\nClym goes over to Captain Vye’s house to help with the fallen bucket. Eustacia watches from a window as the men try to take it out. They’re not able to and leave to come back next day. Clym stays back and talks to Eustacia. Since she says there is no water other than the one in the pool which is dirty, he decides to use a pail to get some water from the well, asks her to hold one end of the rope but in the process, Eustacia gets injured when the rope drags off her palm and takes the skin off. They talk and he tells her of his desire to become a schoolteacher and thinks that she would be a good help since she is an educated woman.

I’ve read it so many times over the years, each time taking something away more than before.\nNow I’m reading it after The Return of the Native and can’t help but compare the approaches of Hardy and Dickens. Both give us a glimpse of a period of time and a set of people that we become intimate with by reading. Through great dialogues, monologues, many times in the dialect of the locals, the readers get to know the emotional state of the protagonists at every juncture of their lives.\nIn this novel, we feel like Pip is narrating as he is living his life and not as a person who is recounting events from his past. The fear he feels with the convict, when he is harassed by the guests, when soldiers come to the door and he thinks they have come for him, his feelings for Estella, his feeling of hopelessness of being a blacksmith, and so on, everything is so well captured, that it is unbelievable.\nThough there is an element of fate interfering withe lives of people in both the novels, I think fate is much more harsher in Hardy’s novel than in Dickens. I think the overarching narrative is that people ‘reap what they sow’ and usually get into difficult situations or fortunate ones depending on many of the decisions they make. Matthew Pocket, Herbert, Joe, Biddy are good throughout and they get rewarded in the end. Compeyson, Orlick, Pumblechook, Drummle, are not and they get punished. But, when I think of ‘The Return of the Native’, I think the narrative is that people don’t have a choice. They are just playthings in fate’s hands. Things will play out the way it needs to regardless of what people plan.\n\nNotes\nStage I\nChapter I - Pip meets the convict\nThe novel starts with Pip, a boy standing near the graves of his parents and his dead brothers trying to imagine what they looked like. We get to know that he had named himself and Pip in his childhood and his actual name is Philip Pirip. He is brought up ‘by hand’ by his sister and brother in law. Brother in law, Joe Gargery, is a blacksmith.\nPip is interrupted by a large, dirty man with prison irons attached to his leg. He demands to know Pip’s name, turns him upside down to empty his pockets, He tells Pip to bring him some food and a file after he gets to know that his uncle is a blacksmith. He tells him that there is a young man with him who will tear is heart and liver out if he doesn’t oblige. Pip runs home frightened.\nChapter II - Pip steals food for the convict\nPip returns to his home. His sister, who is 20 years senior to him, scolds him and asks him where he has been. She reminds him that she brought him up by hand and that he is a burden to her. Her husband, Joe is a mild-mannered person. Mrs. Joe gives Pip and Joe bread and butter fo supper. Pip hides his in his trousers. Joe is surprised that Pip bolted the bread and Mrs. Joe is upset that he swallowed the whole thing. She gives him tar-water as punishment.\nThey discuss about the escaped convicts when they hear gunshots. They live near the coast, near the marshland, where ships that form as jails are docked.\nNext morning is Christmas day. Pip is not able to sleep in the night and early in the morning, he gets up, takes some more food from the pantry, some brandy and runs off to the marshes in search of the convict.\nChapter III - Pip gives food to the convict\nOn his way, he sees man that he thinks is the convict, touches him and gets startled to know that the person is not the person as before. He thinks this is the young man the other man was talking about. The person runs away. Pip walks a bit more and finds the original convict and gives him food and the file. When Pip tells him about the other convict, this man is totally surprised. He gets to file away at the irons on his leg and ignores Pip. Pip slips away and runs towards home.\nChapter IV - Christmas Dinner\nPip rushes home thinking that his theft might have been found out. But is relieved to know that everyone is busy in dinner preparations for Christmas. They have some guests - Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle), Mr. Wopsle (church clerk who has a voice better than the priest) and Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. During dinner Mrs. Joe and Uncle Pumblechook focus on Pip and tell him that he has to be grateful towards his sister. Joe tries to console Pip by pouring some gravy into his plate. Mr. Pumblechook drinks the brandy from the bottle and spits it out discovering that it was tar-water. Pip is frightened thinking that his stealth will get discovered. He is about to run out of the home, opens the door and sees cops outside.\nChapter V - Pip and Joe joins soldiers to search for convicts\nPip is relieved when the soldiers say that they need the services of a blacksmith. So they did not arrive to catch him! The soldiers need help to repair handcuffs. Joe helps with it after that, when they set out to find the fugitives, Joe, Mr. Wopsle and pip join them. After a long search they find them. The two men are found fighting each other in a ditch. The convict tells the soldiers that he was capturing the other convict to bring him to the prison. The soldiers capture both men and take them to the station. Pip wonders if the convict would think that he led the soldiers to them. The convict tells the soldiers that he had stolen some food and file from the blacksmith’s home, thus clearing Pip’s name. Joe says it is ok.\nChapter VI - Pip and Joe get back home\nPip and Joe get back and tell the folks what happened. Everyone wonders how the thief broke in and have multiple theories including him entering through the chimney. Pip does’t tell anyone, not even Joe.\nChapter VII - Pip gets the opportunity to offer services a rich lady\nPip is not old enough to be apprenticed to Joe. So, he attends a school run by Mr. Wopsle’s great aunt. Mr. Wopsle is a tenant of one of the rooms in the building. The building also has a little general shop. The grand-aunt is helped by Biddy who is her grand-daughter. Pip comes home and tries to teach Joe what he has learnt. Joe is super impressed. When asked why Joe didn’t go to school, he talks about his childhood when his dad was a drunkard who beat up him and his mother. Since his mother was abused, he is very careful to note that he would never abuse his wife and is ok to take abuse from her.\nMrs. Joe makes occasional trips with Mr. Pumblechook on market days to assist him to buy household items since he was a bachelor and didn’t trust his servants. One of the days she returns with Mr. Pumblechook to inform Joe and Pip that a rich old lady, Ms. Havisham has asked for a boy and Mr. Pumblechook was gracious enough to suggest Pip. She is very happy and grateful to Mr. Pumblechook for the opportunity. Gets Pip cleaned up for the visit and leaves that night.\nChapter VIII - Pip visits Satis House\nPip stays with Mr. Pumblechook that night and is taken to Ms. Havisham’s mansion the next day. Pumblechook reminds him to be grateful for the opportunity to go into this great house. Though the house is big, it seems very old and not maintained. A gruff young lady greets them, lets only Pip in. While walking she mentions that the name of the house is Manor House or Satis House. She leaves him in a room which doesn’t have outside light coming in but has candles. Pip sees Ms. Havisham dressed in bridal clothes. They look grand but are old and yellow. She asks him to play and he is confused. She then asks him to call Estella. He calls her and they play cards. Estella beats him at the game and insults him for his looks and clothes throughout. He almost cries in front of Estella on the way back but holds back his tears. Pip is so embarrassed by himself that he kicks against a wall on the way back. He realizes that he is a low-life.\nChapter IX - Pip describes events at Satis house\nPip returns home to find everyone very curious to know what happened. Mr. Pumblechook says that he has never seen Ms. Havisham but has had interactions with the house many times on business. Pip is uncomfortable since he is still sad about him being low in the social strata. He invents a story about Ms. Havisham sitting on a black velvet coach, Estella handing her cake and wine on a gold plate, and four large dogs fighting for veal cutlets from a silver basket. They are totally astonished.\nLater Pip tells Joe the truth and he admonishes Pip to not tell lies.\nChapter X - Pip gets money from the convict from the past\nCouple of days later Pip wakes up thinking - best step he could take towards making himself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew. So he goes over and learns from Biddy who is willing to help him with all that she knows.\nOne day, his sister tells Pip to get Joe from a public house named Three Jolly Bargemen on his way back from school, since he goes there in the evenings to smoke. Pip goes there and a man offers them a drink. Joe refuses but the man insists. Pip notices that the man is stirring his drink with the file that Pip had stolen in the past. He gets a fright thinking that his secret would be out. The man gives Pip a shilling wrapped in paper which turns out to be pound notes. Joe goes back thinking it was a mistake but are not able to find the man. Pip has a nightmare about the file in his sleep.\nChapter XI - Pip goes to Ms. Havisham’s again\nIn the last meeting, Ms Havisham had told him to come after 6 days. The day comes and Pip makes a visit to the Manor House. Estella lets him in and takes him to a room where he sees some other people - 3 ladies and a man. A lady named Camilla, who reminded Pip of his sister, a man named Cousin Raymond, another lady named Sarah Pocket, another lady named Georgiana. They look at him and comment about him. He is then taken to another room where there is a wedding cake that is rotten and has insects crawling about them. Ms. Havisham holds Pip’s hand and goes around in the room. She says that when she dies, her body will be on the table with all the people watching.\nPip plays cards with Estella with Ms. Havisham watching. Estella continues to insult him. On his way back, a thin boy approaches him and challenges him for a fight. Pip knocks him down but he always gets up to fight. Finally he gives up. Estella who is waiting at the gate doesn’t ask him why he is late. She grants him a kiss. He kisses her but still feels like a downtrodden person.\nChapter XII - Pip’s appointment at Ms. Havisham’s becomes daily\nNext time when he goes over to the Manor House, Pip is half expecting to be punished or scolded for beating up the thin boy. But he doesn’t find the boy anywhere nor is there any mention of him. He goes in and continues the regular thing of walking with Ms. Havisham in the room and playing with Estella. Sometimes the walk goes on for 3 hours. Ms. Havisham gets to know more about Pip, that he is set to be apprenticed to Joe when he grows older, etc. Pip is expected to go daily and that continues for many months.\nOne day, Ms. Havisham says Pip is old enough to be apprenticed and asks him to call Joe to the Manor House. He gets home and tells the news to Joe and Mrs. Joe. His sister is angry that she wasn’t invited and takes it out on Joe and Pip. She asks Joe why he didn’t marry a slave.\nChapter XIII - Pip’s apprenticeship to Joe is formalized\nThe next day, Pip, Joe and his sister go over to the town. His sister goes to Mr. Pumblechook’s place and Pip and Joe head over to Satis House. Estella opens the gate as usual, doesn’t take any notice of them and leads them to Ms. Havisham’s room. Ms. Havisham asks a few questions to them. Joe answers questions to Pip instead of to Ms. Havisham even for questions directed at him. It embarrasses Pip. Towards the end, Ms. Havisham gives a generous amount of 25 guineas and tells him to give it to his master, Joe.\nThey get back and tell Mrs. Joe and Mr. Pumblechook and they are very surprised at the amount given. As he goes back home, Pip realizes that the job that he once looked forward to, is not exciting anymore. He does not want to be a blacksmith.\nChapter XIV - Pip feels bad about being just a blacksmith\nPip says that it is a miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. He once felt distinguished and happy merely at the thought of becoming Joe’s apprentice but not anymore. As he thinks back, he reminds himself of all the great qualities of Joe. The reason he did not run away or feel out of place, was not because he was virtuous, or faithful, it was because Joe was virtuous, Joe was faithful beyond measure.\nPip is haunted by the fear that Estella would come one day and see him with a black face and hands, dirtied by the job and consider him lower than she already thought and truly despise him.\nChapter XV - Mrs. Joe is attacked\nPip continues to work for Joe. Since he has grown, his education at Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s school is done. Biddy continues to teach him what she knows, Pip tries to learn things from Mr. Wopsle also. He tries to teach Joe what he knows it is not of much use.\nOne day, he asks Joe for half-day off to go to town and see Estella. Joe advises him against it telling him that Ms. Havisham might think that he has gone there to ask for something. Pip is insistent and Joe grants him his wish. Orlick, another chap who works with Joe also asks for half-day telling him that he should treat all employees equally. Joe relents. Mrs. Joe hears this and is totally furious. She asks Joe if he thinks he is so rich that he can afford to waste wages. Quarrel ensues between her and Orlick. Joe beats him up for talking bad to his wife.\nSunday comes and Pip goes to Satis House. Estella doesn’t open the gate, it is Sarah Pocket. Ms. Havisham tells him that Estella has gone away abroad to be educated to become a lady and is prettier than ever, hoping to taunt him.\nPip is in no mood to go home. But goes over slowly. On the way he hears some commotion, someone says there is something wrong at his place. He reaches home to find that someone has broken in and knocked down Mrs. Joe with a very hard blow on her head.\nChapter XVI - Mrs. Joe is paralyzed, Biddy comes to stay to take care of her\nThey discover that the blow was made with the leg-iron that the convict had filed away long back. Mrs. Joe is completely bedridden and Joe and Pip take care of her with difficulty. Mrs. Joe cannot talk and does not know to write.\nLucky for them, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt passes away and Biddy comes to stay with them. She nurses Mrs. Joe and takes care of others.\nMrs. Joe often used to write the symbol of T which Joe or Pip never understood. Biddy surmises that it could mean a hammer. They realize that Mrs. Joe means to say Orlick. They bring in Orlick thinking that she will denounce him as the person who hit her but she is friendly with him and he comes by often after that.\nChapter XVII - Pip confides in Biddy of his desire to become a gentleman\nPip goes to Satis Manor on his birthday to visit Ms. Havisham. She gives him a guinea and tells him to come next yr during his birthday. Pip becomes conscious of Biddy changing into a neat young lady, though not as beautiful as Estella. He asks Biddy how she manages to take care of the house and also catch up with him on all the reading and learning. She reminds him jokingly that she is his first teacher. Pip has heartfelt conversations with Biddy on how he feels. He tells her that he wishes he could be happy as a blacksmith and be with Joe and her but he is not, he wants to be a gentleman. When he tells her than it is on account of a young lady at Ms. Havisham’s, Biddy asks if he wants to be a gentleman to spite her or to win her. She gives the sage advice that both reasons are not good enough and that the lady is not worth winning over. Pip tells her frankly that it would have been easier if he was in love with her than with Estella. Biddy doesn’t mind it and is thankful for his confidence. On the way back home, they meet Orlick and both hate to be with him. She says he has eyes on her and that’s why she doesn’t like him, but it shouldn’t be of Pip’s concern. They get home. Pip’s dissatisfaction with life keep growing and he says that the confusion is fifty thousand fold and is scattering his wits.\nThis is probably the most poignant part of the story yet. One feels sad for Pip, sad for Biddy, and sad for being in a place of unhappiness.\n\n“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?” Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\n\n\n“I don’t know,” I moodily answered.\n\n\n“Because if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”\n\nChapter XVIII - An anonymous patron bestows wealth on Pip\nIt is the fourth year of his apprenticeship with Joe and on one Saturday evening, while they were in Three Jolly Bargemen, a lawyer presents himself and asks for Pip. Pip and Joe go with him to Joe’s home, and Mr. Jaggers, the lawyer tells them that an anonymous patron wants to gift a property to Pip and fund his training to become a gentleman. At the beginning, Mr. Jaggers asks Joe if he wants money or some form of compensation for relieving Pip from his apprenticeship. Joe says no. Mr. Jaggers tells them that Pip will live in London and he can take training from anyone. Since he doesn’t know anyone, Jaggers suggests Mr. Mathew Pocket whom he has heard of. Pip quickly makes the connection to Ms. Havisham since he had heard the name there. Jaggers gives him money to buy clothes. Joe is dumbfounded. Jaggers again asks if Joe needs any money for the loss of Pip’s services and he says no. When Jaggers insists, Joe gets upset. Jaggers leaves. Pip decides that he will buy clothes but not wear them from the village, lest everyone see. He will wear them from Pumblechook’s home and go to London. Pip tells Biddy and she is happy with the news. Though Joe and Biddy are cheerful, Pip is gloomy at the prospect of leaving. But he is also looking forward to leaving.\nChapter XIX - Pip prepares to leave his village\nPip prepares to leave to town to shop for clothes. He mentions to Joe that if he could read or ‘get on a little more’ with the lessons, he could have come with him to London. Joe mentions that he is awfully dull and it is better for him here. Pip mentions the same to Biddy and she tells him that Joe might actually like it here in the village than in London. Pip thinks it is because of her jealousy. Biddy says he can think what he wants to. Pip goes over to the town. Pumblechook is totally a changed man to him now. He ingratiates himself to Pip by giving him the best food, shaking his hands many times and praises him often. Pip gets his new clothes and dresses himself up in those and goes over to Satis House. Sarah Pocket receives him at the gate and he gets to meet Ms. Havisham who already knows about his good fortune from Mr. Jaggers. Pip goes back to Pumblechook’s place, changes clothes and goes to his village. His packs up and bids good bye to Joe and Biddy, who bid him a tearful good-bye. When he reaches the finger-post at the end of the village, he is also overcome with emotion and sheds a tear. He goes on, towards town, taking a coach, changing coaches along the way and onward to London.\nStage II\nChapter XX - Pip reaches London\nPip gets to London. He is scared by the immensity of London and does not like the ugly, crooked, narrow and dirty roads. He goes to Mr. Jaggers’s office and finds out that he is in the court. He is asked to wait in the room. There are many others waiting for Jaggers. When Jaggers comes in he sees how others are scared of him. Jaggers tells him that he is to ramain with Mr. Pocket’s son at Barnard’s Inn, until Monday and then go to Mr. Pocket’s home. He was given generous allowance and cards of many tradesmen from whom he could make purchases.\nChapter XXI - Pip meets Mr. Pocket’s son\nWemmick, Mr. Jaggers’ assistant, takes Pip over to Barnard’s Inn and Pip is not very impressed by the Inn from outside. Pip views it as an imperfect realization of one of his first great expectations. When they reach the room, they don’t find young Mr. Pocket there. Instead they find a note that says ‘Gone out, back shortly’. Wemmick goes away and Pip waits for the young man to come. He takes a bit of time but eventually comes. He says that he had gone out to the market to get some fruits for Pip. When they get to see each other, Pip realizes that the young boy is the same ‘pale young gentleman’ that he had beaten up at Satis House, for which he got a kiss from Estella! Both are surprised.\nChapter XXII - Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham’s sad story\nPip finds that Herbert, Mr. Pocket’s son, is a very amiable person. He tells him that Estella was adopted by Ms. Havisham and that he didn’t care much for being betrothed to her. During dinner, Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham’s story. While eating, he also teaches Pip upper class manners whenever a chance comes. He gives Pip the name of Handel, after a famous composer.\nThis quote about Pip’s impression of Herbert, caught my eye -\n\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich.\n\nI stopped reading the book and thought about myself at that moment!\nMs. Havisham’s Story - Ms. Havisham’s father was a country gentleman and also a brewer. After her mother died when she was young, her father denied her nothing and in his doting, he made her a spoit child. Her father married a servant in secret and had another child, Ms. Havisham’s half brother. As the son grew, he turned out to be a rogue. The father disinherited him and he was out to take revenge. Ms. Havisham falls in love with a showy man who pretends to be a gentleman. But he stands her up during her wedding. It turns out that the man was friends with the half-brother and this was an act of revenge. Ms. Havisham is devastated. Time stops and she has been in her wedding dress with all the arrangements including the cake not being touched or removed after that.\nHerbert says that he works in a counting house who is planning to get into trading in the future. Pip makes a visit to Mr. Pocket’s house after a few days. He finds Mrs. Pocket sitting at a place and reading not bothering about her children. Two maid servants take care of the kids. Mr. Pocket is a good man but is overwhelmed by having so many kids (7 kids).\nChapter XXIII - Pip meets Mr. Mathew Pocket\nMr. Pocket is happy to see Pip and hopes that Pip also finds it good to be tutored by him.\nMrs. Pocket is the daughter of a knight and was brought up as a lady so that she could be an ornamental wife to a man of title. She ends up marrying Mr. Pocket against her dad’s wishes. She is unable to manage her household which is run by the servants. She resents being an incapable person and laments her fall from being nobility.\nMr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and Cambridge and had distinguished himself, but he ruined his prospects by marrying early and to the wrong person. He had to take up tutoring to maintain his family. He is sad about his lost chances and tries to get a break as a favor from one of the parents of the youth he tutors. Though they promise him something, after the education is done, they forget.\nMs. Coiler, a snoopy neighbor, tries to get close to Pip and tells him that Mrs. Pocket thinks it is humiliating that her husband has to tutor.\nChapter XXIV - Pip sees how Jaggers commands respect\nPip takes a long walk with Mr. Pocket and gets advice on how to improve.

Wemmick introduces him to other clerks and also gives him a glimpse of what type of personality Jaggers is. He tells him about the two masks on Jaggers desk, that they were of two famous clients. He takes Pip to court to see Jaggers in action and Pip is very impressed at the respect and fear that Jaggers commands.\nChapter XXV - Pip visits Wemmick’s Castle\nOther students of Mr. Pocket are introduced. Bentley Drummle is a rich spoilt kid who is a blockhead. Startop is a kid who is spoilt by over affection from his mother.\nAfter a couple of months, Mr. Pocket is visited by the relatives of Ms. Havisham that Pip had met in the past. They are Mr and Mrs. Camilla and Georgiana. Camilla is Mr.Pocket’s sister. Georgiana is a cousin. They don’t have much regard for Mr.Pocket though.\nPip decides to visit Wemmick since he had invited him home. They walk to the home and get talking. Wemmick tells Pip that Jaggers never locks his door and challenges anyone to rob him.\nPip reaches the home and finds it to be a fancy one. Wemmick calls it ‘The Castle’. He designed, architected and built the home. It even has a drawbridge and canon (named Stinger). He has an elderly father who he calls ‘The Aged’. There is a little girl who takes care of the Aged. The dinner is excellent and Pip is very pleased.\nChapter XXVI - Pip and friends have dinner with Jaggers\nJaggers invites Pip and his friends for dinner. Jaggers asks about Drummle, giving him a nickname of ‘The Spider’. He has an ability to read people and think what they would amount to. They have a good meal, served by the housekeeper.\nWhen the men have an argument about strength, Jaggers makes Molly, the housekeeper to show her wrists. They look at the disfigured palms and Jaggers tells them that this is is strongest pair of wrists that he has seen.\nWhen the conversations heat up, Jaggers dismisses them and the men go home.\nA few months later, Drummle leaves Mr. Pocket’s home and everyone seems relieved.\nChapter XXVII - Joe visits Pip at Barnard’s\nPip gets a letter from Biddy informing him that Joe is coming to London with Mr. Wopsle and he would like to visit him and if Pip is not available, he could leave a message.\nPip is not quite looking forward to the meeting since he is embarrassed by Joe. He is relieved that Joe was coming to Barnard’s Inn and not to Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket’s home) since he didn’t want Drummle to meet Joe and judge Pip that he has relatives of low status.\nPip has furnished his apartment very lavishly and even has a servant whom he calls The Avenger.\nJoe comes and it is evident that he is not very comfortable in the lavish settings. While they were talking Herbert comes in and is excited to see Joe and talks to him well. Joe tells them that he is in town to see Mr. Wopsle act in a play. Wopsle had left church and now was a full time actor.\nAfter Herbert is gone, Joe tells Pip that he is actually here as a messenger. Ms. Havisham had asked to see him and that Estella was in town. She had sent a word through Pumblechook. Biddy had told Joe that it might be better to inform Pip by word than by letter.\nJoe doesn’t stay for dinner and goes away.\nChapter XXVIII - Pip is on his way to visit Ms. Havisham\nPip decides to make a visit to Satis House. He does a lot of thinking about what to do. Should he stay at Joe’s place? Should he take the Avenger? What if Trabb’s boy tells Avenger unsavory things about his childhood? etc. He decides to stay at the Blue Boar Inn and not to take the Avenger.\nPip finds that in the coach that he takes, two convicts are also being transported. He recognizes one person as the one who gave him two one pound notes. Pip tries his best to avoid the convicts and being recognized.\nThe convicts don’t have a place in the back so they are put in the front much to the dismay of other passengers.\nPip overhears the convicts talking and one of them says that another person had asked him to give two one pound notes to a boy who had fed him and kept his secret. He had done it, though his companion tells him that it was a foolish thing to do hinting that he should have just taken the money. He goes on to say that the other man got charged for escaping prison and got a life sentence.\nPip gets even more alarmed after hearing the conversation thinking that he convict might recognize him soon. So as soon as the town comes, he gets down and walks the rest of the way. At the Inn, the waiter recognizes him and asks if he should send for Mr. Pumblechook. Pip says no and the waiter puts a dirty old copy of a local newspaper where Pip finds Pumblechook mentioned as the founder of Pip’s fortunes.\nChapter XXIX - Pip’s meeting with Ms. Havisham and the lady Estella\nPip wakes up early and goes for a walk and gets thinking, day-dreaming about Ms. Havisham’s brilliant plans for him. He thinks that as she adopted Estella, she adopted him also and is planning to see them united. He also thinks that she has left the house is disrepair so that he could restore the house to its glory. He realizes that he loves Estella against reason, against promise, against all discouragement.\nLater in the morning, he goes to Satis House and is surprised to find Orlick opening the gate. He tells that he left the forge after Pip left and joined as a porter here. Pip goes along the corridor to meet Ms. Havisham and meets Sarah Pocket on the way. He tells her that Mr. Pocket and family are well.\nThere is a young lady by Ms. Havisham’s side whom Pip doesn’t recognize. But when she lifts her eyes, he recognizes that it is Estella. She has returned from France and is to go to London to be introduced to society.\nLater, Pip and Estella walk around the property and Estella tells Pip that she had watched Pip and Herbert fight, in secret. Pip remembers the kiss that she granted him but she doesn’t.\nEstella tells him that she doesn’t remember anything in the past with emotion because she doesn’t have a heart. She has never felt love.\nWhen they get back, they learn that Mr. Jaggers will be dining with them. During dinner, Pip notices that Mr. Jaggers doesn’t give much regard to Estella. He prods Mr. Jaggers about Estella’s past and whether she is Ms. Havisham’s daughter or not. He doesn’t get much from Jaggers.\nAfter dinner Pip goes back to the Boar deciding to sleep there and head for London the next day, without paying a visit to Joe.\nChapter XXX - Pip is mocked by Trabb’s boy\nAt the Blue Boar, Pip tells Mr. Jaggers that Orlick may not the right sort of person to work at Ms. Havisham’s and tells him some of his past. Jaggers agrees to fire him right away. While Pip is afraid to deal with a person like Orlick, Jaggers seems to relish in that. Pip goes into town. He is proud in his gentlemanly clothes and people seem to respect him. He sees Trabb’s boy on the way and gets upset when he imitates and mocks him. As soon as he reaches London, Pip sends codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe as an apology for not visiting. In the next day’s post, he also writes a letter to Mr. Trabb saying that he will not do business with him due to the boy’s conduct.\nPip confesses to Herbert about his love for Estella which Herbert had already guessed. Herbert also mentions to him that since Mr. Jaggers never mentioned Estella, marrying her may not be a condition or wish from his benefactor who he thinks is probably Ms. Havisham. He also warns him that Estella will make him miserable considering the way she has been raised. Of course, Pip doesn’t heed the advice.\nHerbert also confides in Pip about him being engaged to a girl named Clara who he likes but is below his mother’s nonsensical family notions. Pip and Herbert go to see Mr. Wopsle’s play.\nChapter XXXI - Pip and Herbert go to Mr. Wopsle’s play\nThe play doesn’t go well. Some actors are coughing, some have forgotten the lines, audience keep interrupting, etc. Pip and Herbert rush to go out in order to escape meeting Mr. Wopsle but they are stopped by a Jewish man who tells them that Mr. Waldengarver is expecting to see them. That turns out to be Mr. Wopsle. Pip and Herbert are polite to him and say that his acting was good. Pip invites him from supper. He is sad while going to bed and a miserable dream about this expectations being cancelled, he had to marry Herbert’s Clara or play Hamlet before thousands of people without knowing the words.\nChapter XXXII - Pip goes to receive Estella who is coming to London\nPip receives a note from Estella via post which says that she is arriving in London by mid-day coach the day after. Pip arrives at the station 4-5 hours earlier than needed. He runs into Wemmick there who is on his way to Newgate prison to meet a client. He goes with him and is impressed by the way Wemmick is familiar with the prisoners. He gets back and fears if the the filth of the prison has rubbed off on him. Tries to dust himsself off and before long, the coach arrives with Estella in it.\nChapter XXXIII - Pip takes Estella to Richmond\nEstella and Pip get into a carriage to go to Richmond in Surrey which is around 10 miles. During the journey they talk and Pip’s naïveté comes across clearly when he speaks to Estella. She tells him that Ms. Havisham’s relatives write nasty letters about him, sometime anonymously to Ms. Havisham. Pip is surprised that they mean harm to him. Estella assures him that they will never succeed in their machinations against him. On the way they see Newgate prison and Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket’s place). Pip drops Estella to Richmond and then takes another carriage to get back to Hammersmith.\nChapter XXXIV - Pip and Herbert have mounting debt\nPip learns that he is incurring a lot of debt due to his lifestyle. Same is the case with Herbert also. They incur more debt by joining a club named ‘Finches of the Grove’ which encourages to spend more foolishly. Drummle is part of that club.\nPip and Herbert sit down to write their debts, creating sheets with the headings - “Memorandum of Pip’s debts” and “Memorandum of Herbert’s debts”.

Mr. Trabb and Co. had taken over the decorations though Joe didn’t want them saying that it would be disrespectful to Mrs. Joe.\nAfter the ceremony, Pip has dinner with Joe and Biddy. In the night Pip asks Biddy why she didn’t write to him about his sister’s condition. She calls him Mr. Pip and tells him that he didn’t keep in touch and she didn’t think that he wanted to know. She tells him that she is going to leave the forge and be a school teacher. But will continue to look out for Joe. Pip tells her that he will visit more often and Biddy is doubtful and Pip is hurt by her distrust. When he is going away the next day, Biddy apologizes.\nChapter XXXVI - Pip comes of age\nPip and Herbert go from bad to worse in terms of debt. Luckily Pip turns 21 and is expecting money to come from his benefactor by at that time. He gets a note from Wemmick that Mr. Jaggers would like to meet him on that day. Thinking that he would also get to know the name of his benefactor, Pip goes over. Jaggers gives him 500 pounds and tells him that Pip will get an annual sum has to manage his money on his own now. He tells Pip that the benefactor will remain a secret.\nPip goes to Wemmick and tells him that he would like to spend the money on helping Herbert. Wemmick says his professional opinion that one should never invest portable property on a friend. He tell him that he can give his personal opinion at home.\nChapter XXXVII - Wemmick helps Pip to carry out his generosity\nPip makes a visit to Wemmick’s Castle the next Sunday. He find the drawbridge drawn indicating that Wemmick is not home but he rings anyway. The Aged lets him in and says that Wemmick has gone for a walk. Wemmick comes back from the walk with Ms. Skiffins, a lady he is courting. Pip and Wemmick take a walk and Pip tells Wemmick about his desire to help Herbert without him knowing. Wemmick tells him that he can arrange things through Ms. Skiffins’s brother who is an accountant. Later, Wemmick carries out Pip’s plan. Herbert gets a call from Clarriker and Co. with an offer and he is ecstatic. Pip is happy that he was responsible for Herbert’s joy.\nChapter XXXVIII - Estella and Ms. Havisham have an argument\nPip visits Estella often at Richmond where she is staying with a lady named Mrs. Brandley and her daughter. They were people of good position and were visited by many folks. Estella has many suitors but Pip thinks she behaves familiar with him to make the other suitors jealous. Estella warns him not to be attracted to her but Pip doesn’t heed. She tells him that Ms. Havisham has asked to meet and he should take her to Satis House. They go to the house after a couple of days and see Ms. Havisham. She boasts to Pip about the many suitors that Estella has and Pip thinks that she is using Estella just to see men have heartbreaks.\nLater that day Pip sees Ms. Havisham and Estella having a big argument. Ms. Havisham calls her an Ingrate. She accuses her of being cold hearted. Estella replies back saying that she was brought up like that and she can only give what she received. She says that she has never been unfaithful to her schooling and that she has never shown her weakness.\nAfter a few days, at the Finches club meeting, Drummle mentions Estella’s name and Pip is upset. When he visits Richmond, he sees the attention that Estella is paying to Drummule and confronts her and says that he doesn’t like it. Estella says that all she does is to entrap and deceive men, except Pip.\nThe chapter ends by Pip saying that a dramatic turn of event comes to his life much like the roof falling on his head.\nChapter XXXIX - The convict reveals the truth about Pip’s patron\nCouple of years pass by. Pip is twenty three. Pip &amp; Herbert had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year, and lived in the Temple, in Garden-court, down by the river Thames. He has parted with Mr. Pocket also and he maintained good relationship with him.\nOne night, when Herbert was away on Business to Marseilles, Pip receives a mysterious visitor who asks for him. After he comes in, Pip realizes that he is the convict that Pip had saved many years ago. The convict calls him ‘noble Pip’. He reveals to Pip that he is the patron and Pip is stunned. The convict goes on to tell him how hard he worked to make Pip a gentleman and that he is very proud now. He also tells him that he has come to London illegally with the sole purpose of seeing Pip, to see the fruit of his labor of making someone a gentleman.\nPip is devastated by the news. He thinks of Estella and is sad that since Ms. Havisham was not the benefactor, there was never an indirect plan of Ms. Havisham keeping Estella for him.\nStage III\nChapter XL - Pip confirms the convict’s claim with Jaggers\nIn the morning Pip realizes that keeping the convict hidden would not be easy at all. The Avenger was not in his service anymore. He had an old lady as maid and her niece. Asking them to not go to a room would arouse suspicion. So he decides to tell them that the convict is his uncle. It is still early morning and is dark. When he goes out, he stumbles against someone on the stairs. Pip chats with the watchman at the gate and finds out that when Pip’s uncle came in in the night, there was another man who had followed him.\nPip comes back to his quarters and finds that the convict has woken up.

He said he has taken the name of Provis while here. Pip asks if he was followed yesterday to which Provis replies he didn’t know.\nDuring breakfast, Pip notices that Provis ate in a ravenous way and his manners were uncouth. Pip is very uneasy and does not like the man at all. Provis tosses a pocket-book bursting with money and tells Pip that all he has is Pip’s and he would like Pip to spend it on luxuries. He says he would be proud to show off Pip to all the people in the past who looked down upon him. Pip is even more worried and asks for his plans. The convict says he intends to stay there as Provis and it should not be a problem.\nPip goes over to Mr. Jaggers and asks him. Jaggers confirms that the convict, whose actual name is Abel Magwitch is the real benefactor. He still refers to Magwitch and Provis and two different people.

Pip also decides to stop accepting any more money from Provis though he is deep in debt. Since he has not been trained for any trade, he feels like he is good for nothing and being a soldier is his only option. Herbert tells him that he could always work at Clarriker. The decide to ask Provis about his past.\nChapter XLII - Provis recounts his past to Pip and Herbert\nDuring the next day breakfast, Provis tells them about his past. He grew up as an orphan on the streets, surviving by stealing small things or begging. He does not even know how he got the name Abel Magwitch. Around 20 years back, at Epsom races, he met a gentleman by the name of Compeyson. A person whom he would kill right now if he met him, he is the person who Magwitch was fighting with on the ditch as a convict many years back. Compeyson befriends Magwitch and tells him to be his partner. Magwitch finds that Compeyson is not the gentleman he looks like, his business is actually swindling, handwriting forging, stolen-bank notes, etc. There was another man named Arthur who was living with Compeyson in his home upstairs. Arthur was sick and was tended to by Compeyson’s wife out of pity. Arthur has hallucinations of a broken-hearted woman who was going to come for him. He and Compeyson had swindled a rich woman of lot of money in the past. Arthur dies after some time due to his sickness and hallucinations. Compeyson and Magwitch go about swindling and forgery, with Magwitch doing all the work and Compeyson underpaying him. They eventually get caught but the judge passes harsher sentence on Magwitch by his looks and lighter one on Compeyson thinking that he was a gentleman who was influenced badly by Magwitch.\nDuring the imprisonment, Magwitch escapes and he gets to know from Pip that Compeyson had also escaped. So he fights with Compeyson and makes sure to put him in jail though it costs him his freedom.\nHerbert passes Pip a note telling him that “Young Havisham’s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham’s lover.”\n\nWell, instead of reading slowly and writing daily notes, I went ahead and finished the book.

BSG was an unforgettable experience and a very thought-provoking series. Unlike many other sci-fi series or movies, it didn’t have aliens. The fight was between humanoid robots (Cylons) and humans. The series made you see things through the eyes of individuals from both sides - humans who brand Cylons as terrorists and blame them for everything that goes wrong, Cylons who view humans as flawed and blame them for all the wrong in the world. Both sides are victims and both are oppressors.\nNow, if someone were to ask me about my favorite TV series, I think would say ‘The Expanse’ hands down. Though when I think of it, it is kind of tough to choose from a lot of series that I’ve watched in the past decade and a half - The Man in the High Castle, Westworld, Counterpart, Stranger Things, Dark, X-Files, Under the dome, Dark Matter, Continuum, Fringe, 12 Monkeys, etc.. I haven’t seen all the seasons of all the series and I’m sure there are many other good ones I’ve missed. The best aspect of sci-fi movies and series is that they answer the key question of “What If?” - “What if Allies had lost World War II?”, “What if you could go back in time?”, “What if a large dome falls on your town and you’re cut off from the rest of the world”, and so on.\nThe answers to the philosophical question of “What If” can highlight a lot of societal issues that we face in the world today. At the same time, they also are humbling, making us grateful for the life that we have."},"Blog/2020/2020-08-08---The-Writing-Habit":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-08-08---The-Writing-Habit","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-08-08 - The Writing Habit.md","title":"The Writing Habit","links":["books/2020-07-10-the-return-of-the-native/"],"tags":["blog"],"content":"One of the things that I wanted to do this year was to focus a bit more on writing. I’ve had times when I wrote in bursts, and I always told myself - Yeah, this is great. I should do more of it. It is not like I feel like a Yoda who knows too much and needs to write down to teach others, in fact, it is just the opposite. I’m always pulled in multiple directions to learn different things since there is so much to learn. The act of writing itself brings some kind of joy that is fulfilling to me.\nSome short periods of writing that I remember.\n\n2000s\n\nOf course, I wrote a lot of code during this time, but that doesn’t count.\nDuring my initial days as software developer, I used to write on the side, not software or technical stuff but just random things that I wanted to be made as stories.\nStarted blogging using ger.\nStarted writing poetry, even made a book of poetry with my wife.\n\n\n2010s\n\nWhen I took up CS 200, the professor wanted us to write an article every week. That topic of focus at that time was Project Management.\nWhen I took up CS 297, the professor wanted us to write an article or prepare a ppt for the set of research papers we read that past week.\nDoing MS CS at SJSU was probably the best learning experience I had. Got opportunities to solidify a lot of concepts, comprehend technical material better, and write technical papers.\n\n\n\nWriting (or anything for that matter) is easier when you’re doing it for someone. When someone is expecting an output from you, it is easy to sit down and meet the deadline. But there is more satisfaction in doing things that no one asked for, in doing things that you asked yourself. Makes you feel in control and not being controlled.\nSo, I committed to writing at least for 30 minutes per day. Regardless of whether it was good or not, the purpose was to build the habit. I was able to write long notes like The Return of the Native which is over 7000 words by just writing a bit each day as a I read. Was trying hard to follow the Seinfeld method1 and not break the chain. Luckily, github shows the chain beautifully and I didn’t have to buy a calendar like what Seinfeld had suggested.\n\nWriting or reading is the hardest when you have a long list of things to be done and when you feel the need to have more than 24 hours in a day just to keep up with the unending list. It is easy to give advice to someone and tell them to prioritize when they are actually caught in a quicksand that is pulling them down. So, one actually needs to be fortunate to be a able set even 10 minutes towards something that one wants to do. I’m grateful to have gotten the time.\nFootnotes\n\n\nJerry Seinfeld’s Productivity Secret. Seinfeld revealed a unique calendar system he uses to pressure himself to write every day. Here’s how it works. He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker. He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. “After a few days you’ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.” “Don’t break the chain,” he said again for emphasis. ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-08-22---Migrating-to-a-new-theme":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-08-22---Migrating-to-a-new-theme","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-08-22 - Migrating to a new theme.md","title":"Migrating to a new theme","links":["about"],"tags":["blog"],"content":"I’ve been thinking of migrating the site to a new theme which had a better font than I had. Also wanted a smaller font to cover lot of text in a smaller area. Stumbled upon paperesque theme on hugo themes site. It was a simple theme with lot more focus on writing.\nSo, spent some time migrating to the new theme. It is cloudy outside due to the forest fires on Mount Diablo. It seems like winter and somehow looking out of the window and seeing an overcast sky seems to be the perfect weather to write/read or do this work.\nTrials before the migration\nBefore the actual migration, I thought I will try out a few themes to see if something else appealed. Tried the following - bilberry, kube, loveit, mediumish, zzo. Created a new site for each (which is as easy as hugo new site abc) and added the theme there. Then copied over some of my articles to see if it worked. Some of them did, some of them didn’t, some of them didn’t look the way I expected.\nOne thing about migration of any software is that one always enters into it with optimism, thinking that it is going to be simple, just a few minutes of work of swapping one thing for another. That’s probably why most migration projects run over budget. Many times new things are discovered only after one starts the work. But it is fun, challenging and engaging work. While doing it, one might feel like it is a time sucker and want to give up but if you keep at it, the end results are quite satisfying.\nMigration to paperesque\nFew issues that I had to fix were the following. There was a JS error during build that I temporarily fixed by removing it from head_includes.html. There were a few shortcodes that I had created in the aurora theme that I had to bring over. Spent some time figuring out how to change the home page. Tried to use the old style of two columns with a lot of links. Then decided against it. Wanted to put that content into about.md. Was wondering how to do that and then realized that the easiest way to embed HTML into markdown file is to create a shortcode. Shortcode is a super-power in hugo. One can do a lot of wonders using that. Also, spent time figuring out how to add social media buttons on the About page. W3 schools has the easiest example to embed social media buttons.\nNext day edits - New migration to Even\nAfter having the site set up with this theme, I wasn’t quite happy. The original intent was to move to a theme which put the blog posts in the front. This one still had the earlier issue of a user having to navigate to the actual post by clicking twice. So migrated to another theme that I had tried in the past. I didn’t have to do much for this. It had a bigger feature set than what I wanted though it didn’t have the beauty of paperesque. One thing that attracted me to theme Even was the Table of contents on the right side with highlights of the section that I was reading. So spent some more time migrating to the newer theme.\nEdits after a week - New migration to Diary\nThe more I looked at the site, I thought the older theme was probably better. Still think that a left nav with some static details, central body with text and a right have with dynamic toc is better. At least for desktop viewing. The theme Diary gave these. Though it doesnt have social media icons, I thought it was cleaner and better. I could add the social media icons later.\nHere are some screenshots of ‘the before and after’ of the current migrations.\nPrevious Site\nHome Page\n\nA blog post\n\nNew Site\n\nA blog post\n\nNew Site #2\n\nA blog post\n\nCurrent Site\n\nA blog post\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-08-28---The-Money-Effect":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-08-28---The-Money-Effect","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-08-28 - The Money Effect.md","title":"The Money Effect","links":["posts/2006-03-19-francisco-d-anconia-speech-money"],"tags":["blog"],"content":"“Money is the root of all evil” took a different meaning in my mind when I read this portion (quote below) from Thinking, Fast and Slow. Set me thinking about different interactions with people in the past and different kinds of projects and people’s attitudes.\nWhat came to mind were transformations in people when the goal was changed from ‘doing something to benefit someone’ to ‘doing something to meet a financial target’. That even the best of teams could set out to build a scalable platform might take shortcuts to launch something if money is the target. There is an urgency that sets in when money is the focus which makes many other things oblivious. I think companies and teams should always have users as the target rather than the revenue goal itself. It is probably better to visualize the customer and the impact that we might be having to their livelihood. That is way more empowering in my opinion. Of course, there are many companies who do this really well.\nOf course, when someone hints at money’s corrupting effects, people usually respond with Francisco d’Anconia’s speech from Atlas Shrugged or something similar that looks at it from value and effort. The speech is right in its way of looking at things, but is wrong in so many other ways. Nothing is black and white ever. If money represents value and labor, why is a disproportionate amount of money found with people who did not create value or work for it?\nOne could argue that civilization exists today (in contrast to being blown up) because, in every group of people, there are individuals who are willing to spend time and energy towards causes that are beyond themselves without expecting a reward. People are willing to compromise to maintain peace, are willing to teach others for free, willing to help the poor, willing to help the elderly, and so on. Money is not the center or the value of exchange for so many transactions. Some ‘mission’ is. Open source software has probably added more value and raised awareness and knowledge to the average citizen on earth than proprietary software.\nAnyway, it was interesting to know that psychologists have studied this and that there are case studies and numerous examples of human behavior towards money. Also, it doesn’t even have to be conscious. One’s attitude towards money and thereby to other human beings could be shaped by the place and society or upbringing.\nif so much of what we do is influenced by our upbringing and by priming (from things that we see daily, say social media), it is even more important that critical thinking becomes the most important skill that needs to be taught to everyone. Use System 2. Being a person who reacts to other people’s suggestions more often than not, the message of “Use System 2” is more of an advice and admonition to me than anyone else.\nHere is the passage from the book.\nQuote\n\nReminders of money produce some troubling effects. Participants in one experiment were shown a list of five words from which they were required to construct a four-word phrase that had a money theme (“high a salary desk paying” became “a high-paying salary”). Other primes1 were much more subtle, including the presence of an irrelevant money-related object in the background, such as a stack of Monopoly money on a table, or a computer with a screen saver of dollar bills floating in water.\n\n\nMoney-primed people become more independent than they would be without the associative trigger. They persevered almost twice as long in trying to solve a very difficult problem before they asked the experimenter for help, a crisp demonstration of increased self-reliance. Money-primed people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time helping another student who pretended to be confused about an experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on their mind picked up fewer pencils. In another experiment in the series, participants were told that they would shortly have a get-acquainted conversation with another person and were asked to set up two chairs while the experimenter left to retrieve that person. Participants primed by money chose to stay much farther apart than their nonprimed peers (118 vs. 80 centimeters). Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone.\n\n\nThe general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. … living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.\n\n~ Thinking, Fast and Slow2\n\nImage Credit - flic.kr/p/s6895e (Pictures of Money)\nFootnotes\n\n\nReference to Priming (Priming is a phenomenon whereby exposure to one stimulus influences a response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)) ↩\n\n\nKahneman, Daniel.

I was expecting just an episode to get launched in the typical HBO fashion. But getting 3 episodes was a bonus. Though I would have preferred to just have one. It would have given enough time to think about the episode and read articles about it till the next one came.\nThis is probably the ‘best of times’ for the sci-fi genre as a whole. I’m looking forward to the next seasons of His Dark Materials2 and The Expanse3. The trailer for the Foundation4 series on Apple TV was awesome though I wish it were available on Prime. Also, expecting Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time5 to be engaging and thought-provoking. Not sure if the LOTR6 TV series could better Peter Jackson’s movies, but it would be interesting to see. I wish there were more seasons of The Man in the High Castle7. Can’t believe that they are thinking of rebooting Battlestar Galactica8. There is also Dune movie9 and TV series10 on the horizon with the promise that it would be better now than all the adaptations in the past. There are many more than what someone could hope to watch. I think there is something for every science buff out there. A time of abundance indeed.\nI was impressed by ‘Raised by Wolves’. I’ve liked other sci-fi movies by Ridley Scott - Alien11, Prometheus12, etc. The tech is always impressive and one is hopeful for the better future that is in store for us. But while the earlier movies had life of earth as peaceful and humans exploring distant places on the universe, this one is about humans being forced to evacuate due to strife on earth.\nIt aligns with the current divided world that we’re living in. I think, just a couple of decades ago, the majority of people were optimistic about technology and the future in general. But now, the clock seems to have dialed back to world war times. Issues like religious intolerance and racism which were solved 50 years ago or before, are in the forefront. Social media seems to have given power to the fringe elements than the average person.\nThe backdrop of ‘Raised by Wolves’ is that humanity is fighting against each other and is on the brink of extinction. What are they fighting about? Religion of course. The atheists manage to send a small spacecraft with a couple of androids and 12 embryos to Kepler-22b, a habitable planet that is about 60 light-years from the earth. The believers of the Mithraic cult send an ark with around 1000 people to the same destination. The show starts with a nuclear explosion on earth being seen far away from the first spacecraft, which implies that earth is destroyed.\nThe belief that people will destroy earth, seems to be a foregone conclusion by a lot of thinking people. It is so sad to even think of it. My view is that no one should possess any weapon that could destroy the whole earth. But the invention cannot be undone. Humanity as a whole is immature, and now the children have big toys to wipe everything out.\nThe idealists think that a small group can run away and build a new civilization without the bigotry and narrow mindedness. The androids in RBW believe the same. They think that they could give humanity a reboot by starting afresh with 12 embryos on a new planet. But that has been tried so many times on earth itself. Wherever humans go, trouble follows sooner than later.\nI think the better bet would be to just send androids to a new planet to colonize. i.e, when AI becomes more mature. If AI reaches the 2nd level (AGI - Artificial General Intelligence) as mentioned in this Wait buy why13 article, then they may be able to independently create robots and androids.\nBut even if just androids are sent to a new planet, say Mars, they are going with morality that is being put into them by humans. Depending on which country or culture they are sent from, they could be biased. If bias by smart and efficient people on earth is so disadvantageous to the marginalized, then bias from things that are multiple times smarter would be catastrophic.\nIf AGI gets being created by consuming all the digital material available today, then we’re already on the wrong path. In the last 10 years alone with the explosion of social media, so much of junk has been put on the digital world that they don’t represent the best of humanity at all.\nI think the Plan B of going out of earth should not be a solution. People need to get ahead of the fundamental differences that exist.\nIt has been proven over and again that monarchy, fascism, communism, or any ideology that divides people is not a solution. Bigotry and hatred can only lead to destruction. Getting a better understanding and believing that humanity is one species and every person is 99.9% similar to other, is the key. Yes, a positive and generous worldview.\nAs mentioned in 21 lessons for 21st century14, secularism is a positive and active worldview. It is not opposed to religion. Secularism views morality and wisdom as the natural legacy of all humans, not something handed down from God to a specific set of humans at a point in time.\nThe Secular Ideals -\n\nCommitment to truth\nCompassion\nCommitment to equality\nCherish Responsibility\n\n\nAnother aspect of films like Alien or Prometheus or TV series like The Expanse, that I like, is the belief that there is life out there. The universe is so vast. Though the probability of conditions to create life is so tiny, the universe is so vast that the probability is quite real.\n\nPlan B15 is a reference to Elon Musk saying couple of years back that humanity needs to have a Plan B, of either setting up a colony in the Moon or Mars, in case of World War III.\n\nImage Credit - commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kepler-22_diagram.jpg\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised_by_Wolves_(American_TV_series) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials_(TV_series) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(TV_series) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_(TV_series) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(TV_series) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(2020_film) ↩\n\n\nwww.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/dune-sisterhood-tv-series-a-go-at-warnermedia-1217286 ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film) ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(2012_film) ↩\n\n\nwaitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html ↩\n\n\nwww.amazon.com/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0525512179 ↩\n\n\nsputniknews.com/viral/201803121062437450-musk-space-travel-mars-colonization/ ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-09-12---C-U-Soon":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-09-12---C-U-Soon","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-09-12 - C U Soon.md","title":"The Chained Non-citizens","links":["posts/2020-09-05-plan-b/"],"tags":["Movies","Trafficking","blog"],"content":"\n“Man is born free, yet everywhere he is in chains.”\n~ Jean-Jacques Rousseau 1\n\nThe movie - C U Soon\nSaw this amazing movie named C U Soon2 on Amazon Prime. The movie format was unique. Most of it was shown through video conferencing and chat. One gets to know the characters and their lives through chat messages and dialogues that happen through video apps. Chat and video have become the main medium to keep in touch with friends and family who are increasingly living in different parts of the world. That was portrayed beautifully in the movie. Clever movie-making shows cinema as not merely imitating life but extending it.\nAs a viewer, you need to be more involved in it than a normal movie since you need to read the chat messages fast, look at the expressions of the faces of the characters as they talk to each other through Duo 3. You also get to see the extreme multi-tasking that the young people of the current generation are used to (or subjected to). Jimmy, the main protagonist, is not only talking to his client at work but is also looking at the financial metrics and chatting with his girlfriend at the same time. It is like doing three things in parallel. Sometimes he even chats with his friend at the same time. Chat as a medium allows us to do multi-tasking, communicate with multiple people as well as do other things on the computer/phone.\nParallel Lives?\nAlso, I think Gen Y has truly embraced the concept of “bringing your whole self to life”, which a generation back, was quite uncommon. People kept work and life separated and their true personalities and beliefs disjointed with work (Reminded of Wemmick in Great Expectations “The office is one thing, and private life is another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me.”). As a generation that was born in the age of the Internet with mobile phone usage and social media being the norm, they embrace technology and live naturally in the digital world. The virtual world, many times, diverges from the real world, and sometimes people can be shocked at the reality in the same way Jimmy is shocked at finding that the real Anu is different from the online persona. I think the same thing happens to people who are living in a world of books and movies. They might be living in the Victorian age of Jane Eyre4 or thousands of years into the future in the world of Paul Atreides5. One expects to be living in an age of enlightenment and suddenly sees BLM protests and burning of buildings, it is tough to come to terms with reality.\nFahadh Faasil\nI was super impressed by Fahadh. Every movie of his that I’ve seen in recent times has been thought-provoking, and I can’t but feel that he is a true genius. The last 3 movies of his that I saw - “Trance”, “Natholi Oru Cheriya Meen Alla”, and “Kumbalangi Nights”, were each unique and offered perspectives unlike anything else that I’d seen. Trance was probably one of his best movies, though I haven’t seen all of his movies 6 yet. His movies cover so many aspects of human life that one can talk about each for ages. The movies cover wide-ranging themes like love, addiction, religion, commercialization of spirituality, hypermasculinity, patriarchy, poverty, rural life, city life, daydreaming, communism, and so on. Kudos to Fahadh for being the producer and playing the role of Kevin to perfection.\nThe Key message\nThough the movie depicted many facets of today’s life - online interactions, forming a relationship without meeting a person in person, living mostly indoors, the ability to hack into someone’s digital profile to get information that they didn’t give, the shock of dealing with real-life challenges, etc., the key take away, the moral of the story, so as to speak, was about human trafficking. People being duped with the promise of a job opportunity or better life prospects and taken to a different country to be made slaves, is the modern-day abduction. Legally or illegally, if a person goes to another country and is trapped and abused, and cannot talk about it, he/she becomes a chained non-citizen.\nThe Chained non-citizens\nA non-citizen is “any individual who is not a national of a State in which he or she is present.” 7 If a person is taken to a foreign country and if passport and other legal documents are taken away, then the person loses the freedom of choice and is no better than an illegal non-citizen. The person has been ‘trafficked’! Many people who get into the trap of trafficking are in the ‘jumping out of the frying pan to the fire’ situation. They have come to that point in life, probably because of the culmination of a series of misfortunes. It is like you’re at the edge of a cliff of despair: no money to live, poor parents, possibly a sick parent, mounting debts. You feel checkmated from all sides, and the only option is to trust a stranger and go abroad for work. There are millions of people who are victims of trafficking worldwide. My wife is on the board of a non-profit8 that fights sex trafficking, and the stories, facts, details, and statistics that she shares with me fills me with sadness about the human condition itself. But it is not that people are facing misfortunes; the biggest tragedy is that there are always people who take advantage of such people in dire situations.\nSome statistics of trafficking are below -\n\nAt any given time in 2016, an estimated 40.3 million people were in modern slavery.\nOut of the 24.9 million people trapped in forced labor, 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture; 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons in forced labor imposed by state authorities.\nWomen and girls are disproportionately affected by forced labor, accounting for 99% of victims in the commercial sex industry, and 58% in other sectors.\n\n~ Source - ilo.org article 9\n{{&lt; tweet user=“robinsonraju” id=“1252674542398390272” &gt;}}\nWhy does trafficking happen?\nTrafficking is one of the ailments that has made the story of humanity miserable on earth. Why is there so much misery? By all accounts, things should have been so much better. Books like The Better Angels of our Nature10 and Factfulness11 do point out that the standard of living has become far better than a century ago. That the hopelessness we feel when we read about war and trafficking is due to information being more accessible. Even then, I feel that with the technological progress that humans have made, things could have been much better.\nIt is a complex issue, and there are so many causes, but the main issue could be the disparity of wealth distribution and accessibility to technological advancement and modern science. There are still places that lack the infrastructure or where basic living conditions are not good enough. Poverty and lack of basic amenities could turn people towards a life of crime to have a fighting chance to live unless they are helped. People could get pushed into poverty due to a variety of reasons. It could even be environmental issues like floods, forest fires, diseases, or even mental issues. I’m not sure if we could even say that man is born free (referring to Rousseau’s quote above). Many people are already in chains depending on the place of birth. The journey of life could be a the path to freedom or further enshacklement.\nIs there a solution?\nThere are so many philanthropists and organizations at work to help people out of poverty, but the effort seems to be not moving the needle on a large scale.\nIs a belief system the solution? If a large number of people believe that human life is the only chance that our soul has, to understand God, and to be virtuous, the only path, will that reduce misery? It has been proven over again that human beings cannot stick to a specific belief system as new ideas emerge in every generation. Religious zealotry creates more problems than it tries to solve.\nThe solution probably lies within the human intelligence itself. Technology could be advanced to provide food for every single person on earth. World hunger can be and should be solved. I think Maslow’s hierarchy of basic needs can be met by technology/machines sooner than later if more people become self-aware, understand the concept of life better, and respect each other. A lot of time and energy is spent on negativity and fights all over the world. Covid-19 proved that governments can give money to each citizen if needed. Universal basic income is not such a remote concept after all. The view that people may not be motivated to work if basic needs are met is so antiquated. All the progress that the world has seen in the last 100 years is mostly due to the relative peace that existed in the world. Peace cannot exist in a divided world. I guess I’ve come back to the same ending as the previous post on the merits of a positive and generous worldview.\n\nImage Credit - flic.kr/p/9xSTCc (Maria Charitou)\nFootnotes\n\n\nArticle about Rousseau on fs.blog ↩\n\n\nC U Soon on Wikipedia &amp; C U Soon on IMDB ↩\n\n\nGoogle Duo video calling app ↩\n\n\nJane Eyre on Wikipedia ↩\n\n\nDune on Wikipedia ↩\n\n\nFahadh’s movies on IMDB ↩\n\n\nDefinition of Non-citizen ↩\n\n\nOne Bread Foundation Board of Directors ↩\n\n\n11 Facts about Human Trafficking, ILO Stats - Trafficking ↩\n\n\nThe Better Angels of Our Nature on Wikipedia ↩\n\n\nFactfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think on Wikipedia ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-09-19---Paradise-on-Fire":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-09-19---Paradise-on-Fire","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-09-19 - Paradise on Fire.md","title":"Paradise on Fire","links":["Dune-movie"],"tags":["California","Forest-Fire","blog"],"content":"\n“The deepest lessons come out of the deepest waters and the hottest fires.”\n~ Elisabeth Elliot\n\nCA wildfire, Orange skies in SF Bay area, and Dune movie trailer\nIt seemed like a weird coincidence that Dune1 trailer2 got released on the same day that the skies in San Francisco turned orange3. I turned to Twitter and Google to see if it was just me! Was happy to find that many other people thought so too. Phew! It is sometimes strange to have a thought and think, ‘what if nobody thought that way?‘. Another thing that flashed through my mind when I saw the trailer was the thought that they had cast a South Indian actor in the movie. For a moment, I thought that Duncan Idaho, played by Jason Momoa was Manoj K Jayan! Googled to find if someone thought so. Looks like no one did! But Jason Momoa looked quite different from what we saw in GoT or Aquaman.\nBack to the coincidence, yes, there were numerous tweets, memes, and articles on the same. In fact, a lot of sci-fi movies depict an alien planet like red deserts. So, looking out of the window and seeing it, in reality, was too surreal. One could draw a loose parallel to the 9/11 tragedy4. Prior to the incident, there were hundreds of movies that showed tall buildings collapsing with thrilling stunts, but when the incident happened in reality, it was shocking. The power of our imagination far too exceeds the perception of our physical senses.  As virtual reality becomes more mainstream and gaming becomes very immersive and engrossing, I wonder if people could lose a sense of reality. A situation quite similar to The Matrix5.\nCalifornia - The land of Dreams, Earthquakes, Droughts, and Fires\nAn article that caught my eye was titled “‘Dune’ trailer released as West Coast wildfires rage on, fans say Arrakis-like orange skies part of the promo”6. Though it was meant in jest, I think there may be many people who believe that it could well be a movie promo stunt, that it is possible to do such a thing to promote a movie, and that the technology to change an entire landscape probably exists. The Gold Rush in the 1800s paved the way to the idea of the ‘California Dream’ to believe in the unbelievable, expecting to strike it rich at any moment, wiping the slate clean and living anew, and living freely. The state motto is “Eureka”, which reminds one of the naked Archimedes running through the streets of Syracuse7 to tell of his discovery of the relationship between the density of a substance and the amount of water it displaces. One could as well equate the neo inventors of the tech industry or space exploration or electric cars with the phrase of Eureka now. From the bubble of Silicon Valley in the North to Hollywood in the South, people are constantly creating new things, the next new software or fantasy movies with incredible visuals, using machine learning and multi-core computers, perpetuating the myth of human progress that we do not yet possess.\nShaky grounds and Raging fires\nThat the dreams manifest and more dreams are unspooled in the background of a land that is seemingly unsafe, seems ironic. Almost the entire state is on large earthquake faults, and a major earthquake could wipe out big cities like SFO or LA at any time. Forest Fires are a recurring thing every year, and in the past few years, they have become bigger. This year over 3 million acres got burned down 8.\n\nAcademics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California’s agency land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. 9\n\nMany people who experience a couple of earthquakes move out of California to different places since they don’t want to pin their future on shaky grounds. The first earthquake, for anyone who comes new to the area, is an experience of a lifetime. I’ve experienced a couple of small ones, all while in office, and they were over before I could react.\nBut forest fires are extremely scary. Fire is a much more visible destructive force. It is heart-wrenching to see raging fires razing towns and vast expanse of forests to the ground. Imagining the heat and the skin burning fills the heart with dread. A city named Paradise10 got destroyed completely a couple of years ago. It was probably a sign of what was coming for the larger “paradise” that is the state of California.\nCan fire be not controlled?\nIn Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind11, Yuval Harari, a historian, tells the history of humanity in a most engaging manner like a thrilling story revealing one thing after another. He says for humans, “a significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire”. It is true. The ‘domestication of fire’ catapulted humanity to make huge strides of progress and change the face of the Earth forever. An ‘Animal of No Significance’(ref: Sapiens) is now able to leave Earth and go to space, a remarkable achievement in a short amount of time.\nIn spite of all the technological progress, why are people not able to control fire? That too raging in a place like California. I guess the pandemic and the devastating forest fire this year has removed the veil and shown the reality. Though a lot of progress has been made, we’re still on the edge of the vast sea of knowledge. There is much to learn and discover about the nature of things on Earth itself. Much to learn about the human body itself. Somehow the ability to create things virtually and seeing things in CGI in movies and TV series makes one believe that humanoid robots are already here, though it is far from the case.\nHere is the sentiment from Calvin in 1989! 12\n\nThe article9 in ProPublica where the quote above is referenced from, says, “Megafires, like the ones that have ripped this year through millions of acres, will continue to erupt until we’ve flared off our stockpiled fuels. No way around that.” So, as per experts, the way to avoid massive fires, is to light smaller controlled fires. Prevention is better than cure!\nMaybe the next breakthrough is to make fire-resistant material cheaper so that homes and buildings can be constructed. That way, there is a Plan B in case fires cannot be prevented, or they go out of hand. Moreover, many of the fires are due to human errors and not naturally started. The Dragon Capsule 13 that Doug and Bob came back in, withstood temperatures of over 7000 degrees Centigrade on its entry to the atmosphere. So there is technology to build materials that are fire-resistant to the extreme and could be used to build structures that can withstand fire.\nI’m sure there are thousands of other ideas. But I think the main problem is that there are too many problems to tackle, mostly caused by people and ideologies. Also, the collective human mind is now mostly engaged in the virtual world.

As the Supreme Court nomination becomes a hot topic between the political parties in the U.S., people who haven’t heard of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg are asking themselves who was the Notorious RBG 1 and learning more. The legend spreads, and the number of people who get inspired grows. More people, especially young women, will feel empowered to stand up and challenge the long-held notions of discrimination, bias, and unjust norms. Twitter was abuzz with condolence messages from all eminent persons all across the world. It was unbelievable that she had touched the lives of so many people.\nI got to know about RBG quite late in life, probably because she didn’t pop up in the tech and sci-fi world that I live in. Got to know through my wife, who is into non-profit work and reads a lot of non-fiction and world news. The impression grew multi-fold after we saw a movie named ‘On The Basis of Sex’2. Felicity Jones did a great job as a fiery young RBG, and Armie Hammer was awesome as the understanding and supportive Marty Ginsburg. Got to know more about RBG since then through many articles. It is surprising that once you know about an eminent personality, you tend to get more about that person in your daily feed - Youtube, Google searches, Newsfeed, Amazon feed, etc. You just need to search for something, and that magically alters the digital pathways of your life with the answer to the search peppered all across the myriad paths at different points.\nRBG - Achievements\n\n“The life of the dead is placed on the memories of the living. The love you gave in life keeps people alive beyond their time. Anyone who was given love will always live on in another’s heart.”\n~ Cicero\n\nI think every major news outlet has written in depth about the accomplishments of RBG. Here are a few - One from Harvard (The life and legacy of RBG)3, Good Housekeeping (Here’s How Ruth Bader Ginsburg Changed American Life for the Better)4, and another from Achievment.org (Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Justice, Supreme Court of the United States)5. As you read through the articles, you realize that she did live an extraordinary life.\nReaders’ Digest had a bulleted list of achievements (“15 Ways Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Has Made History”)6 that I thought would share some of them here -\n\nShe graduated first in her class from Columbia Law School. (The movie - ‘On the Basis of Sex’ shows the reason for her move to Columbia)\nShe battled—and overcame sexism personally.\nShe was the first person on both the Harvard and Columbia law reviews.\nShe became the second woman law professor at Rutgers.\nShe co-founded the first law journal on women’s rights.\nShe became the first tenured woman law professor at Columbia.\nShe co-founded the Women’s Rights Project at ACLU.\nShe became the first woman Jewish Supreme Court justice.\nShe is one of only four woman justices in history of the U.S.\nShe had “In the year of Our Lord” removed from Supreme Court bar certificates.\nShe was the first justice to officiate a same-sex marriage.\nShe’s the only Supreme Court Justice to become a pop culture icon.\n\nReflections\nViewing the Departed\n\n“Don’t be dismayed at goodbyes. A farewell is necessary before you can meet again. And meeting again, after moments or lifetimes, is certain for those who are friends.”\n~ Richard Bach (Illusions)\n\nEvery death this year has made me think of many deaths in the past, of people that I knew personally or through media. I’ve thought a few times about the nature of death itself. Mainly about how it would have been if there was not a pandemic spreading across the world today. Thousands of people attended the vigil7 for RBG and many lined up to view the casket 8 last Wednesday and Thursday. But, it might have been a different thing altogether if it had happened last year.\nI wonder about the thousands of other people who passed away this year, either due to COVID or other natural causes. Did their loved ones get to see their bodies or caskets? I think viewing the body or the casket after a person has passed away is fundamental to humans. For most of history, people knew only those in their surroundings and were able to see the dead. The connections were deep, and each death mattered a lot. Every culture had some ceremonies around saying good-byes to the departed and processing grief. It is also a time for the community to come together and give support to the family. It also helps to bring closure. Otherwise, deep down, one is left thinking if that person is still there since the last memory you have of the person is when he/she was talking to you or doing something else while living. There is an unresolved void when you only hear about a person’s death and didn’t see them.\nA long time back, an Achen (priest) had told us a story during a sermon to illustrate the importance of visiting a funeral. A family had moved from Calcutta to Bangalore, and the elderly father had passed away. After the funeral service, the son spoke to Achen and said that if they were in Calcutta, there would have been a huge gathering since his dad was a well-known person in the Church and community there. During the funeral here, he felt so deserted. I still remember Achen telling us that day that there is not a great service than visiting someone after death, paying respects, and consoling the family.\nBut I cannot help thinking whether viewing the body is as important to the next generation as previous ones. We’re at a point in history where an average human ‘knows’ a lot more people than in the past. Through movies, social media, and news outlets, we’re exposed to so many more people. And so many pass away on a daily basis. Does the news of their passing affect us at all? Is that another news item that most people are numb to it. An abundance of anything causes numbness. When we know too many people, we cannot connect deeply with anyone. During the initial stages of COVID, every death count was so alarming, but as the number crossed hundreds of thousands, it has just become another number.\nDying Alone\n\n“There’s no greater misfortune than dying alone.&quot;&quot;\n~ Gabriel Garcia Marquez\n\nAnother effect of CoViD this year is people dying alone. Since COVID is contagious, many patients are ostracized and might be passing away in loneliness. We used to be friends with a priest who was a Hospice Chaplain in a hospital in SF. He has retired now but used to tell us about comforting people in the last stages of their death. Many old people are grateful to have someone by their side to talk to. I feel sad about the shadow of loneliness that has enveloped the world at this moment. The biggest curse of the virus is not its debilitating effects on the lungs but the solitary confinement that many people are subjected to because of it.\nBut the Internet has been a ray of hope that connected people during this time. We’re able to get to know information faster, and through telephones and video calls people are able to talk and see folks who are in treatment. At least, something is better than nothing.\n\nImage Credit - pixabay.com/illustrations/ruth-bader-ginsburg-5592652/\nFootnotes\n\n\nnotoriousrbg.tumblr.com/ ↩\n\n\nOn the Basis of Sex - IMDB ↩\n\n\nThe life and legacy of RBG - Harvard community reflects on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a trailblazing, tireless fighter for rights ↩\n\n\nHere’s How Ruth Bader Ginsburg Changed American Life for the Better ↩\n\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg - Justice, Supreme Court of the United States ↩\n\n\n15 Ways Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Has Made History ↩\n\n\nwww.nytimes.com/2020/09/19/us/politics/ginsburg-funeral-services.html ↩\n\n\nwww.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/09/23/rbg-ruth-bader-ginsburg-fans-casket-supreme-court/ ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-09-26---on-death":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-09-26---on-death","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-09-26 - on-death.md","title":"The Next Adventure","links":["Blog/2014/2014-01-20---Alexander---Proof-of-Heaven"],"tags":["Death","blog"],"content":"The Next Adventure\n\n“I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.”\n~ Mark Twain\n\nIs death the next adventure or the end of the only adventure that a person’s consciousness has ever known? Religious people are afraid of death, thinking about the sins they have accrued and being afraid of the judgment in the afterlife. Non-religious people are afraid of the nothingness. Of the ceasing of the only adventure that they’ve known. But the better philosophy for the mind, regardless of whether one believes in it truly or not, is one of optimism. Hope is the only thing that would make life here more serene. The universe existed billions of years before humans appeared on the scene on Earth, but every person can reflect every day to evaluate if he/she has done something to make the world a better place. If not, do something today to make tomorrow better. Knowing that you’ve helped another live better, that you’ve helped pave the path for the next generation to have a better life, that you’ve created things to improve the civilization as you know it, means you don’t have to be worried about death at all.\nReminded of a book that I’d read sometime back 2014-01-20 - Alexander - Proof of Heaven where the author talks about a Near Death Experience. There are a lot of books on NDE, Astral Projection, and similar tell us about what it feels like for them but they cannot really convey how we can experience it. Moreover human mind is so complex that people can imagine things that are extremely strange and unbelievable.\nBut at the end of the day, belief in anything, even in oneself, is personal. One could close one’s eyes, imagine latching one’s soul to the bird on the window sill, and fly away looking at the body sitting on the chair with eyes closed. As the bird goes farther, the home, at the city, the bay, everything looks smaller and smaller. And when one comes back after the journey, did one really travel or just replay all the past images seen through videos from drones and airplanes? What about a human 10000 years back? What did they imagine? I guess not something too far off. Deep down, most humans want to believe in the unknown. Most people know somehow that the human body is more than more flesh and blood."},"Blog/2020/2020-10-03---Brown---Dare-to-Lead":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-10-03---Brown---Dare-to-Lead","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-10-03 - Brown - Dare to Lead.md","title":"Dare to Lead: Brave Work.

That’s why we choose courage.”\n~ From Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts.1  by Brené Brown\n\nThoughts\nIt feels super inspirational to have finished this book. The book was excellent and it felt good to know that all the people who spoke highly of Brené Brown were justified in doing so. In the last few years, I’d come across Brené Brown’s name many times, through Booklists by leaders I revered2, YouTube feed, Amazon recommendation, etc. In a way, I was primed to read a book by Brené. So, when I chanced upon it recently, I jumped in. It was coincidental that I came across the excellent video on empathy 3 by Brené just when I started reading the book.\nIt feels natural to call the author by first name rather than the full name or the last name. After listening to the audiobook for over 8 hours, you feel like you know the author already. Or it may be due to the anecdotes in the book where she puts conversations where people call her Brené. For instance “BEN: Hey, Brené! Please pull all of the invoices together for me by four o’clock.” (Section 3 - The Armory). Throughout the book, people call her Brené and we also end up doing the same I guess. I generally prefer a book on kindle or printed since that is much faster to finish than an audiobook even at a speed of 1.25. But I’d really recommend the audiobook for this. Brené is an exceptional orator and her voice is so soothing and compelling at the same time that you feel like an esteemed teacher is right there with you, talking in person.\nAnother reason why I felt happy with the book was that it validated a lot of leadership thoughts and ideas that I had. Leadership is about bringing clarity, trusting people who work with you, empowering people, seeking constant feedback, making sure that people feel a sense of belonging, investing time ahead in planning and not pointing fingers when things go wrong, giving honest feedback from a place of vulnerability knowing that the relationship might sour, above all, putting empathy as the cornerstone of all the activities. Business goals that we achieve are for people and done by people.\nThe book has a lot of anecdotes, practical examples, and calls to action that it is useful to situations beyond the workplace. There are so many life-changing quotes in the book to ponder over. I underlined a lot of quotes and felt like I should take a print out and frame some of them. It is one of those books that when you read it and finish, you want to start reading again. I felt the same with 7 Habits (Steven Covey), 12 Rules (Jordan Peterson), Factfulness (Hans Rosling), 21 Lessons (Yuval Harari), Good to Great (Jim Collins), etc. I haven’t read other books by Brené Brown. So I was glad to hear her say that this book contains thoughts from her other books.\nThe main focus of the book is the call to become more courageous, creative, and caring; to grow through vulnerabilities and insecurities; to bring the full person to work, and not a part of the personality. Brené says that achieving workplace goals effectively and efficiently can be done without sacrificing humanity, by being trustworthy, authentic, and empathetic. She also mentions that “Rumbling with Vulnerability” is not about blindly airing your fears to everyone. The right audience needs to be told the right things.\nThere is a companion website called “Dare to Lead Hub” 4 with a lot more ways to get involved in the book with assessments, workbooks, and training. It seems like a movement in itself. Big Ideas from the book are presented in the “The heart of daring leadership” section in the Introduction. The notes below will give you highlights of some aspects of the book, especially the bulleted points mentioned at different places. But, ‘The Map is not the territory’, the summary is not the book. Reading the actual book is a totally different experience and I hope this encourages you to do so.\nNotes\nThe title of Brené’s earlier book Daring Greatly came from a quote by Theodore Roosevelt -\n\n“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again…who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.”\n\nIntroduction: Brave Leaders and Courage Cultures\n\nBrené’s goal is to take her two decades of research and experiences in hundreds of organizations to give us a practical, actionable  book about what it takes to be a daring leader.\nI echo Brené’s sentiment that she wants to live in a world with braver, bolder leaders, and to be able to pass that kind of world on to the next generation.\nDefinition of a Leader : “Anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.”\n\nTen behaviors and cultural issues getting in our way\n\nWe avoid tough conversations including giving honest productive feedback.\nWe spend an unreasonable amount of time managing problematic behaviors.\nDiminishing trust caused by a lack of connection and empathy\nNot enough people are taking smart risks or creating or sharing bold ideas.\nWe get stuck and defined by setbacks, disappointments and failures.\nToo much shame and blame, not enough accountability and learning.\nPeople fear looking wrong, saying something wrong, or being wrong.\nWhen something goes wrong, individuals and teams are rushing to ineffective or unsustainable solutions.\nOrganizational values are gauzy and assessed in terms of aspirations.\nPerfectionism and fear are preventing people from learning and growing\n\nThe heart of daring leadership\n\n\nYou can’t get to courage without rumbling through vulnerability. Courage is a collection of 4 skill sets than can be taught, observed, and measured\na. Rumbling with vulnerability\nb. Living into our values\nc. Braving trust\nd. Learning to rise\n\n\nSelf-awareness and self-love matter; who we are is how we lead.\n\n\nCourage is contagious\n\n\nPart One: Rumbling with Vulnerability\nSection One: The Moment and the Myths\n\nThree Lessons from Roosevelt’s quote mentioned at the beginning -\n\nPhysics of Vulnerability - if you’re brave enough often enough, you will fail.\nDefinition of Vulnerability - “The emotion that we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure”. It is the courage to show up when we don’t know the outcome.\nFeedback needs to be authentic and should come from a place of vulnerability where the person puts himself/herself on the line.\n\n\nRumble Tool - The Square Squad - Get a 1” x 1” piece of paper and write down the names of the people whose opinions of you matter. Take 10 minutes to reach out to those people and express gratitude.\nThe 6 myths vulnerability -\n\nVulnerability is weakness.\nI don’t do vulnerability.\nI can go it alone\nYou can engineer the uncertainty and discomfort out of vulnerability.\nTrust comes before vulnerability.\nVulnerability is disclosure. (Not only is fake vulnerability ineffective, but it breeds distrust.)\n\n\n\nSection Two: The Call to Courage\n\nAn anecdote about a time when her team gave Brené feedback about her time estimation. She remembered that her husband had given similar feedback in the past.\nIt is not a long walk from “I’m not enough” to “I’m better”, but it’s actually just standing still.\nTreasure Hunting - 4 key learnings\n\nNew Meeting minutes process - Someone volunteers as a note-taker and takes down the minutes capturing a)Date b)Meeting intention c)Attendees d)Key decisions e)Tasks and ownership.\nTurn &amp; Learn - People write down their thoughts before anyone speaks up in a meeting. Avoids “Halo effect” (opinions shaped by person with the most influence) and “Bandwagon effect” (see where ‘the wind is blowing’ / agree with the majority).\nGritty faith and Gritty facts - Stockdale paradox from ‘Good to Great’. The people who don’t make it after 8 years in captivity were the Optimists. Always confront the brutal facts of your reality.\nCare and Connection - Apologizing and backing that up with behavior change. “What’s my part” is critical to the success of the rumbling process.\n\n\nDeDe Halfhill’s story - Using the right language to talk about hard things.\nContainer building - Make copies of this story, ask the team to review it, come back after 45 mins to discuss. No time? “If you don’t invest time attending to fears, you’ll have to squander time to manage unproductive behavior”!\nYou cannot take responsibility for other people’s emotions.\n\nSection Three: The Armory\n\nWholeheartedness - “engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough …”\nBringing your whole self to work is crucial to the company and individual success and satisfaction.\nThe table comparing “Armored Leadership” with “Daring Leadership” is perhaps the best part of the book. The side-by-side comparison is found in the workbooks section5 in the Dare to Lead Hub.\nTheir team switched to TASC model from Apple’s DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) model. TASC approach: the Accountability and Success Checklist -\n\nT — Who owns the task?\nA — Do they have the authority to be held accountable?\nS — Do we agree that they are set up for success (time, resources, clarity)?\nC — Do we have a checklist of what needs to happen to accomplish the task?\n\n\n\nSection Four: Shame and Empathy\n\nStory about Brené hitting a glass wall and suffering a concussion at a very busy time, refusing to be treated and impacting everyone around.\nShame 101 - a) We all have it, b) We are all afraid to talk about shame, c) The less we talk about shame, the more control he has over our lives\nHow shame shows up at work - Perfectionism, favoritism, Gossiping, back-channeling, harassment, discrimination, bullying, etc.\nGive people a “way out with dignity”. What gets in the way? a) Armoring up, b) Time &amp; Money, c) The fall guy, d) Lack of vulnerability and courage.\nEmpathy is one of the linchpins of cultures built on trust. Five elements of empathy -\n\nTo see the world as others see it, or perspective taking.\nTo be non-judgmental.\nTo understand another person’s feelings.\nTo communicate your understanding of that person’s feelings.\nMindfulness.\n\n\nSix known barriers to empathy -\n\nSympathy vs. Empathy\nThe Gasp and Awe\nThe Mighty Fall\nThe Block and Tackle\nThe Boots and Shovel\nIf You Think That’s Bad…\n\n\nFour elements of shame resilience -\n\nRecognizing shame and understanding its triggers\nPracticing critical awareness\nReaching out\nSpeaking shame\n\n\n\nSection Five: Curiosity and Grounded Confidence\n\nPool players example - Practice is key. Hundreds of hours of practice to build foundational skills make things seem easier.\nGrounded Confidence = Rumble Skills + Curiosity + Practice\n“If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend fifty-five minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.” (Einstein)\n\nPart Two: Living into Our Values\n\nThree steps to live into your values -\n\nWe Can’t Live into Values That We Can’t Name. Pick 2 values from the list (p 188) or name yours.\nTaking Values to Behavior.\nEmpathy and Self-Compassion: The Two Most Important Seats in the Arena\n\n\nGet good at giving feedback. Go through the feedback checklist of 10 questions.\n“Know my values = Know me”. “No values = No Me”.\nOperationalizinator - Someone who operationalizes values into skills-based behaviors that can be taught, observed, and evaluated.\nAssume positive intent and hold people to high standards.\n\nPart Three: Braving Trust\n\nThe BRAVING Inventory -\n\nB = Boundaries – Respect my boundaries, yet be brave to ask if something is not ok.\nR = Reliability – You do what you say you’ll do.\nA = Accountability – You own your mistake, apologize, and make amends.\nV = Vault – Don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share.\nI = Integrity – Choose courage over comfort.\nN = Non-Judgement – We can talk to each other and ask for help without judgement.\nG = Generosity – Assume best intentions.\n\n\n\nPart Four: Learning to Rise\n\nThe three-step process for learning to rise -\n\nThe Reckoning\nThe Rumble\nThe Revolution\n\n\nThe Reckoning - Six most common offloading strategies\n\nChandeliering\nBouncing Hurt\nNumbing Hurt\nStockpiling Hurt\nThe Umbridge\nHurt and the Fear of High-Centering\n\n\nStrategy for reckoning with emotion - Tactical Breathing - In for four, hold for four, out for four, hold for four.\nThe Rumble - Shitty First Draft (SFD) - The first story that we make up. Be courageous to state your SFDs and improve it as you get feedback or more data.\nThe Revolution - Taking off the armor and rumbling with vulnerability, living into our values, braving trust with open hearts, and learning to rise so we can reclaim authorship of our own stories.

Pessimism leads to paranoia, which leads to defensiveness, which leads to risk aversion. Optimism sets a different machine in motion.”\n~ From The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company.1  by Bob Iger\n\nThoughts\nIf I could describe the book in one word, it is - Optimism. The book charts the big milestones in Bob Iger’s life mainly focusing on the 45 year career at Disney/ABC.  He faced many challenges as he rose through the ranks and what stood out was the strong belief that every challenge was something that could be overcome, that a disruptive idea was not really a long shot once you got into the details, that when you believe in people you can get extraordinary things done. His bosses believed in him and he believed in the people that worked under him. Huge acquisitions like Pixar (7.8 B), Marvel (~4 B), Lucas films (~$4 B), and 21st Century Fox (over 50 billion dollars) were viewed as deals that were good for the consumers and the companies and not takeovers. There is a remarkable scene in the book where Steve Jobs comes to the board of Disney to pitch the sale of Pixar and even Iger is mesmerized by his impassioned speech. I think no other company could have made the running of a big business as a service to people, especially kids and families like Disney did, except maybe Google. Iger did an excellent job of portraying the positive side of Disney.\nAs a top executive, Iger is humble throughout and it comes across in the narrative. It is an emotional, straight-from-the-gut retelling of life at different stages of his career. He believes in the cause, puts in more effort, has the grit to ride out difficult times, and has a great work ethic. He had great bosses that he looked up to, especially Tom Murphy and Dan Burke who bet on talent and put people at places which would help to blossom their abilities. Also, it is not just about work. He brings in a lot of humanity into the book. He talks about his friends and family and other people that he leans on for support. It was enlightening to see the personal relationship he had with Steve Jobs. He dealt with people as friends. His accounts of the Marvel and Lucas films deals were heartwarming since he describes these as times when he forged friendships with Ike Perlmutter and George Lucas.\nI came across this book in Gates Notes2 and found the review by Bill Gates to be a great endorsement. I was also amazed at the great reviews and thumbs up on Amazon and Goodreads. The book lived up to the expectations and didn’t disappoint at all. Would gladly recommend to anyone who is in need of some inspiration. The other business book in recent times, that I was excited to read based on the excitement of the reviewers was The Goal, which is another great read.\nOf the many life lessons, one thing that stood out for me was the description of how a manager at a big corporation should be.\n\n“Managing your own time and respecting others’ time is one of the most vital things to do as a manager. ”\n\n\n”.. in a company like Disney, if you don’t do the work, the people around you detect that right away and their respect for you disappears. You have to be attentive. You often have to sit through meetings that, if given the choice, you might choose not to sit through. You have to learn and absorb. You have to hear out other people’s problems and help find solutions. It’s all part of being a great manager.”\n\nThere are other great life lessons and the best thing is that Iger has condensed all of it as short notes at the end of the book in the Appendix. As always, I took some notes at the end of every chapter but I guess that was not needed since the gist is there in the appendix.\nNotes\nPrologue\n\nThis is probably the best start of any book and clearly shows the challenges that Iger faced. It is 2016. Shanghai Disneyland which took 18 years to build, is in the process of opening up. Nightclub shooing in florida, and the alligator attack of a small boy at Disney happen around that time. He speaks to the boy’s father and in less than half an hour attends a banquet for Disneyland.\nHe has worked for the same company for 45 years - 22 at ABC, 23 at Disney with 14 yrs as CEO.\nSome key pointers -\n\nEven the least eventful days require the ability to constantly adapt, and re-adapt.\nThere are always cries and failures for which you can never be fully prepared.\nThe days are challenging and dynamic, but they’re also a never-ending exercise in compartmentalization.\nTen principles necessary to true leadership\n\nOptimism\nCourage\nFocus\nDecisiveness\nCuriosity\nFairness\nThoughtfulness\nAuthenticity\nThe Relentless Pursuit of Perfection\nIntegrity\n\n\n\n\n\nPart One: Learning\nChapter 1: Starting at the Bottom\n\nHe has always been a person who woke up early and that has helped him throughout his life, to be able to carve out time in the morning to think.\nHe fell in love with books in high school. He credits his dad who had a den lined with shelves of books.\nHe started working at young age. He got a chance to work at ABC through his uncle Bob who met someone while at hospital.\nHe was a fan of Frank Sinatra and the high point was him getting a gold cigarette lighter inscribed ‘Love Sinatra’, which he still has in his possession.\nThe personality of Roone Arlidge loomed large in his life at this point. He learnt a lot from him.\nHe credits Arlidge for instilling the ‘relentless pursuit of perfection’, about creating an environment where one refuses to accept mediocrity.\n\nChapter 2: Betting on Talent\n\nCap Cities, a smaller company acquires ABC. Iger along with others are surprised.\nWith time, Iger grows to respect the new owners - Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. Warren Buffett had called them “probably the greatest two-person combination in management that the world has ever seen or maybe ever will see”.\nCovering Winter Olympics in Calgary was a great opportunity for Iger.\nIger talks highly of Tom and Dan and calls them ‘perfect bosses’. He learnt from them that genuine decency and professional competitiveness weren’t mutually exclusive, that ‘betting on brains’ and giving people the right opportunity to flourish was the best thing to do.\n\nChapter 3: Know What You Don’t Know (and Trust in What You Do)\n\nIger takes up the job as the Head of ABC entertainment and moves to L.A.\nAt the outset he says that he had no clue about how things were done at Hollywood. He also points out that ‘inexperience is no excuse for failure’.\nHe was fully dependent on Stu and Ted. His managers Tom and Dan had full faith in him and that was a huge morale booster and he didn’t feel like the was leaping without a parachute.\nDoogie Howser M.D. was one of the first successes. Then came Twin Peaks which was a huge success. Cop Rock, a musical police drama, was a failure.\nThe key lessons were - Never start negatively, never start small, take big risks and fail sometimes rather than not taking risks at all, be comfortable with failure and own up to failures.\n\nChapter 4: Enter Disney\n\nAvoid getting into the business of manufacturing trombone oil. You may become the greatest trombone oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end, the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year. (Dan Burke)\n\n\nThe quote above is mentioned a few times and it was a like a guidepost to Iger.\nDisney acquires Cap Cities/ABC. For Iger, it didn’t seem like a good career option. He was in line to become the next CEO of ABC and was being asked to run the media division of Disney for at least five years.\nHis wife Willow was very supportive. Tom had a lot of confidence in Iger. He told him that if Iger did well, he could run the bigger company some day.\nHe was expecting to be #2 to Michael Eisner but Eisner got in Ovitz to that position and Iger reported to him. He describes it as an unproductive period.\nOvitz was not a fit to the corporate culture at Disney and the description of that period was a lesson in how to be a good manager and also that when executives fight, it is the team that suffers.\nThe key thing is to ask hard question and take fast decisions when things don’t work out.\n\nChapter 5: Second in Line\n\nAfter Ovitz left Eisner didn’t officially announce a #2, but Iger was running most of the things.\nThe key thing is to focus on the job and do it well rather than focus on the next job and not do the current one well.\nABC entered a downward slide in ratings. Who Wants to be a Millionaire brought in success.\nABC’s 24 hour coverage of the Millennium was a novel idea and a great success. Iger was the boss of his earlier boss Roone Arlidge and appealed to his sense of pride to take up the challenge.\nIger’s vivid description of visiting Arlidge while in hospital was touching.\nEisner tells the board that Iger cannot be CEO and Iger is hurt when he hears that. But he doesn’t quit.\nEisner later makes a proposal for Iger to become President and COO and a member of the Disney board.\n\nChapter 6: Good Things Can Happen\n\nIger describes how Eisner had become a legend as a person who had ‘re-founded’ Disney. He was remarkably creative businessman and is credited for turning Disney into a modern entertainment giant.\nHe learnt a lot from Eisner during this period through his visits to Disney parks and Imagineering. Eisner used to be referred to as an oppressive perfectionist and a micromanager. He was proud of it and would say “Micromanagement is underrated”.\nDisney and Pixar have a deal but Pixar feels it is lopsided. Eisner and Jobs don’t get along well.\n9/11 happens and Disney and ABCs profits and ratings go down.\nRoy Disney becomes critical of Eisner and wants to have him replaced. He launches “Save Disney” campaign.\nComcast tries a takeover bid that fails.\nBoard wants a new CEO and tries to shortlist candidates. Iger is the only internal candidate.\n\nChapter 7: It’s About the Future\n\nIger has many interviews and meetings with the Board and others to convince them of his vision for Disney and to convey that he was the best suited to be CEO at that point.\nHe urges the board to look to the future and not the past. Many times he feels the pressure and also gets frustrated in a meeting at one point.\nScott Miller gives him good advice on how to view it as a campaign, define priorities and pitch the ideas clearly.\nIger defines three key priorities for the company under his leadership -\n\nDevote most of the resources to creation of high-quality content. (reminded of trombone oil quote)\nEmbrace technology - to enable creation of content, to reach consumers.\nBecome a truly global company.\n\n\nIn the end, Iger is named the CEO by the board. He is at home with his wife and kids when he gets to know the news from George Mitchell through phone. Eisner also calls him. He later calls his parents, his old bosses - Tom Murphy and Dan Burke, and Steve Jobs.\n\nPart Two: Leading\nChapter 8: The Power of Respect\n\nIn week 1 of the CEO-in-waiting period, Iger calls his closes advisers and lays out the immediate things to be addressed -\n\nBury the hatchet with Roy Disney.\nTry to salvage the relationship with Pixar and Steve Jobs.\nBegin the process of changing the way Disney made decisions, which consisted of restructuring Strat Planning.\n\n\nBefore he could reach out to Roy Disney, Roy and Stanley Gold sued Disney over Iger’s appointment. Iger talks to Stanley and then to Roy, agrees to make Roy as Director Emiretus in the board. The key take away is to “Not let ego get in the way of making the best possible decision”.\nHe patches up Disney’s relationship with Steve Jobs and even forges a friendship. He is on stage with Jobs during the launch of video ipod.\nHe restructures Strat Planning and the company morale across the board goes up.\n\nChapter 9: Disney-Pixar and a New Path to the Future\n\nWhen Iger starts with the talks of Pixar acquisition, everyone is against for multiple reasons, Jobs will not sell, it is too big a risk to take as a new CEO, etc.\nIn his first board meeting, he makes a presentation of the parade in Disneyland Hong Kong that showed that there were no Disney characters in the last decade. Then pitches the idea of Pixar acquisition.\nHe visits Steve Jobs at Pixar office in Emeryville and is impressed at the campus. They whiteboard the pros and cons.\nMinutes before the deal is announced, Jobs takes Iger into confidence and tells him about his cancer and offers that he could back out if he wanted and put the blame on Jobs. It is a poignant moment and Bill Gates highlights this event in his review. Iger doesn’t backout.\nThe key point was the optimism that Iger had about the future of Disney and Pixar with the deal.\n\nIt could fix Disney animation which was core to the success of Disney since the beginning.\nIt would bring Steve Jobs into the Disney Board.\nIt would bring a lot of technological prowess and a culture of excellence into Disney.\n\n\n\nChapter 10: Marvel and Massive Risks That Make Perfect Sense\n\nIger talks about how he got in touch Ike Perlmutter and the process of acquiring Marvel. Ike is described as a tough-to-reach private person and Iger shows a lot of patience in dealing with him. When Ike is not convinced that the Marvel culture would be changed with the acquisition, Steve Jobs calls him and says that Iger would be true to his word.\nIger talks about a personnel mistake that he made - Rich Ross who was very successful at running Disney channel but failed as the chairman of Disney Studios. He fires Rich and brings in Alan Horn who ends up transforming the division.\nHe gives a lesson on firing people - that it has to be done in person, look the person in the eye, not use anyone else as an excuse, be direct, etc.\nAbout hiring he says “Surround yourself with people who are good, in addition to being good at what they do.” Honesty and Integrity matters a lot.\nLot of people and media criticize Iger for the 4 billion dollar price tag for Marvel but he says time have proven that it was one of the best acquisitions ever.\nHe talks about Black Panther and Captain Marvel which were again discouraged since they didn’t fit the stereotype. But former becomes the fourth highest grossing superhero film of all time, and the latter the tenth, Both earning well over $ 1 billion.\n\nChapter 11: Star Wars\n\nIger attends Steve Jobs’ funeral and mentions about Jobs’ confidence in him during the Pixar deal. Jobs’ wife, Laurene tells Iger the other side of the story and that Steve Jobs really liked him.\nAcquisition of Lucas films was an emotional roller coaster. Iger was patient throughout the process and treated George Lucas with greatest respect at the same time protecting the interests of Disney.\nThey bring in JJ Abrams to direct the first Star Wars movie under Disney and that becomes a huge success.\n\nChapter 12: If You Don’t Innovate, You Die\n\nIger talks about his concern about Disney’s place in the future and the need to adapt to the changes and to launch a streaming service directly to the consumers.\nHe goes through a phase of discussions around buying tech companies. They almost end up buying Twitter but he changes his mind in the last minute.\nThey buy a controlling stake in BAMTech which helps them build Disney+ and ESPN+. It meant taking a profitable section of business and investing into future. Though the books don’t look good in the short run, it is going to be a major success in the future. Stock market rewards Disney for this.\nIger talks about a time when he was thinking about running for President. Rupert Murdoch calls him and asks him about it.\nAfter his meeting with Murdoch, the idea of buying 21st century fox takes hold.\n\nChapter 13: No Price on Integrity &amp; Chapter 14: Core Values\n\nIger visualizes the combined company after Fox acquisition and whiteboards the different operational groups the company would be divided into. He gets his staff onboarded with the idea.\nBut the deal itself takes long to materialize due to Comcast bidding at a higher price, then backing off, then coming back after AT&amp;T merger with Warner Media is approved.\nThough Iger is reluctant to go above 28 price point initially, after the AT&amp;T-Warner deal when Comcast makes a 35 a stock, cash offer to Fox, he raises the bid to $38, and finally gets the deal.\nIt is also a period of turmoil since a few key executives get caught in harassment cases - John Lasseter for unwanted physical contact with women, John Skipper for drug abuse. He removes both from their posts and is left with no one managing Disney Animation and ESPN suddenly.\nAfter the merger with Fox and the presentation to the media about the future prospects with Disney+, Hotstart and others, the response from Wall Street was great with the stock going up 30% in a month.\nHe wraps up by saying that 2019 was going to be his retirement date and it was changed to 2021 due to Fox merger. He mentions that he had great mentors and bosses along the way.\n\n\nBook cover Image Credit: play.google.com/store/books/details\nFootnotes\n\n\nIger, Robert. The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company. United States: Random House Publishing Group, 2019. ↩\n\n\nwww.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Ride-of-a-Lifetime ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-10-17---The-Great-Mental-Models,-Volume-2":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-10-17---The-Great-Mental-Models,-Volume-2","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-10-17 - The Great Mental Models, Volume 2.md","title":"The Great Mental Models: Volume 2: Physics, Chemistry and Biology by Shane Parrish and Rhiannon Beaubien","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Business","Philosophy","Mental-Models","book-notes","blog"],"content":"\n“Combining a deep specialized knowledge in a domain with a broader understanding of the rules that govern the physical world is a rare combination that saves you time, money, and problems.”\n~ “The Great Mental Models Volume 2: Physics, Chemistry and Biology”1 by Shane Parrish.\n\nThoughts\nIt was greatly fulfilling to read this book. On the one hand, it was nostalgic, and on another, it was an eye-opener to know how things are connected. It took me back to my school days where I had learnt a lot of basic concepts like inertia, friction, evolution, etc. There is joy in learning for the sake of knowing things and in school, you get to learn new things in each class and it is a wonderful experience. Math and Physics were my favorite subjects in school, closely followed by Biology and Chemistry. As adults we read more and are exposed to more information on a daily basis, it is not the same as structured learning in school. As kids we learn new things in a variety of subjects but as adults the learning is sometimes focused on narrow areas of work or the group we’re in.\nOf late, there are talks all over the world about overhauling the educational systems because, there is a general dissatisfaction and misunderstanding about what needs to be taught. Some want to reduce pure sciences and focus more on practical training, some want to focus on nationalism and history, some want to go back to religious teachings that are centuries older, and so forth. Instead of building upon what we have, there is a tendency to erase and start afresh. In the chapter on ‘Hierarchies’, Parrish cites the example of the French revolution to show that “People could not destroy the hierarchy altogether; they just ended up with a new form of it.” We see examples of this over and again. People who don’t learn from history are cursed to repeat it.\nThis book is a testament to the fact that learning basic sciences is crucial to our knowledge. They give us the building blocks using which so many of the happenings in the world can be explained. The world is a mystery when we’re born, and through every waking moment, we’re trying to make sense of it. Even the basic understanding of the Sun, the Moon, other animals, and vegetation will be flawed if we were to make our own theories about them. Centuries of research and debates have given rise to the current understanding of the world. We could seek to learn from them, understand that and add to it. By refining our understanding at different stages with new information, we can always connect the dots and fill the blanks. The best way to gain more understanding is to have different mental models and apply them to various situations.\nThe book covers terms in Physics (relativity, thermodynamics, inertia, friction, viscosity, velocity, leverage, etc.), terms in Chemistry (catalyst, alloying, etc.), and terms in Biology (evolution, ecosystem,  replication, etc.) and explains how these fundamental concepts have parallels in social situations. One gets the feeling that everything is an interconnected web. Even a few of these mental models could be used for most situations in life and knowing them is incredibly useful. Shane says at the end of the book that these are tools and not necessarily connected together. It is for us to pick and choose what makes sense for us to form a latticework of models that we can best apply.\nThere are some great quotes in the book and a lot of enriching references. It is also an introduction to a lot of famous people - Aristotle, Rafi’ al-Tahtawi, Norman Bethune, Hadrian, Alice Hamilton, Lise Meitner, Taiichi Ohno, Napoleon Bonaparte, Mae West, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Leonardo da Vinci, Heidi Lamar, Frank Lloyd Wright, Geerat Vermeij etc. Also, many women scientists whose contributions were incredible but not well known. Overall, it is a great book to be read and reflected upon.\nAs I was reading this over the last week, I got this quote from James Clear’s newsletter2 last Thursday and thought it was quite timely -\n“The fastest way to improve is to learn from others.\nRead good books\nTalk to people who have done it\nSoak up the lessons of the past\nLearn from the experiments history has already run and you can start the race halfway finished.”\nNotes\nIntroduction\n\nVolume 1 had introduced 9 General Thinking concepts which had broad applicability.\nVolume 2 explores fundamental ideas from physics, chemistry, and biology and how these ideas offer insights that we can apply to improve our lives.\nLife will be better if we “work with nature instead of against it”. That needs the effort to understand nature itself. e.g. - Fram boat anecdote from In Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life by Helen Czerski. No one was able to get to North Pole since ships got destroyed due to the pressure from ice. Fram boat was designed to float on top of ice when the pressure from ice on both sides increased.\nModels in the book are value-neutral. They can be used to highlight positive or negative aspects of a situation. They function as metaphors or tools of comparison. They are tools that can be used in myriad ways.\n\nPhysics\nRelativity\n\nPut it into perspective.\n\n\nThere is more than one way of looking at things. All perspectives may not be equally valid though.\nThe key thing is to acknowledge that we may not have the full picture.\nE.g. - Galileo’s thought experiment about a person dropping a ball from a moving ship. The person in the ship sees it vertically moving down, a stationary person outside might see the lateral movement.\nE.g. - Einstein’s thought experiment about a person in a moving train seeing light from 2 ends of a train. The person sees light from the front first, but the person outside sees both arriving at the center simultaneously. I think this was mentioned in Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time”3.\nE.g. - Eyewitness testimony - from Rashomon4, a famous Japanese movie about differences in the testimonies of several eyewitnesses to a crime.\nE.g. - Chris Kinison’s killing in 2000. shows that Self-interest and time can distort a person’s memory.\nE.g. - Seeing things in a new lens. Story of 6 Muslim students from Iran in London in 1815. Mirza Salih, one of the students kept a diary of his experiences and his account of a visit to a museum shows how he was able to compare Iranian history with other countries.\nE.g. - Egyptian named al-Tahtawi traveled to Paris in the late 1820s and wrote about his 5 yrs in Paris and this had cultural and scientific impact in his country.\nSummary - In the physical world, relativity exists because things are moving in relation to other things. It is the same in the social world, there are always moving parts and different ways of looking at things.\n\nReciprocity\n\nGive and Take.\n\n\nNewton’s third law - “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”\nPhysical world examples - gravity, jet propulsion, tackling in football, etc.\nGiving is as valuable as having. But doesn’t mean that for every good thing that you do, you get corresponding amount of positive results.\nCommon phrases - “Quid pro quo” (something for something), “tit for tat” (this for that), “do ut des” (I give, so that you may give)\nE.g. - Norman Bethune, a Canadian surgeon, who provided medical services free to the poor and established a free-of-charge clinic when he was working in Montreal, who designed and developed the first ever mobile blood transfusion unit while in Spain, went to China in 1938 and was responsible in setting up a lot of medical infrastructure that saved millions of lives. His achievements are regarded as heroic in China even to this day.\nWhen we give, we get. We improve our physical health and feel better about ourselves and our place in the world.\nConcept - “Loss Aversion” - When compared directly, losses always loom larger than gains. This prevents people from giving if there is a risk of getting nothing at all.\nConcept - “Shadenfreude” - Joy in someone else’s misfortune. We feel strongly when someone’s misfortune seems to be earned, something that happened due to their misdeeds.\nE.g - “Eternal Treaty” between Egyptians and Hittites at a time when fighting wars and winning was the norm. This established peace which was very useful to both countries. They got more in return.\nSummary - “Be the change you want to see.” Small changes in your actions change your entire world.\n\nThermodynamics\n\nReduce chaos and find order.\n\n\nLaws of Thermodynamics -\n\nFirst Law (Law of Conservation of Energy) - Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. It can only be transferred.\nSecond Law - Entropy of any isolated system always increases.\nThird Law - Entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.\nFourth Law (Zeroth Law) - If two objects are in thermal equilibrium with a third object, then those two objects are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.\n\n\nEquilibrium\n\nSystems always tend to move towards equilibrium. If there is hot object next to cold, there is energy transfer towards making both at the same temperature.\nE.g. - Hadrian’s wall (facilitate interaction) - Used to control the movement of people.\nE.g. - Great Wall of China (prevent interaction) - designed to prevent mingling of people/cultures. Was not successful since equilibrium cannot be avoided.\nE.g. - Berlin Wall - built to stop movement of ideas and people. People still crossed, at great risks to themselves, many getting killed in the process.\n\n\nDisorder\n\nLife is naturally disorderly and a constant effort is needed to maintain structure.\nE.g. - Fairy tales, structure of a story, Hero’s journey.\n\n\nSummary - Barriers you erect will face a relentless pressure to get broken. Understanding randomness and bringing order is a basic pursuit of human life.\n\nInertia\n\nNothing happens unless something moves.\n\n\nNewton’s first law of motion (Inertia) - “An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.”\nInertia helps explain why we continue with bad habits and why it is so difficult to make a systemic change.\nOnce an idea gets rolling, it can be hard to stop. Momentum (p) = m*v, greater the mass and velocity, greater the momentum.\nE.g. Harmful effect of lead. Over time lead got used in so many different places that in spite of overwhelming evidence of its bad effect, it could not be removed from the day-to-day things.\nE.g. Absinthe - In contrast to lead, this lasted only for 50 yrs before it was banned altogether. Mass matters! It was easier to Absinthe out of the market.\nIntertia in War - If soldiers are able to rest well, they build better momentum.\nEscape velocity - The force that is needed to escape gravitation pull is highest at the beginning.\nE.g. Lise Meitner - Great researcher whose contributions were not recognized since she was a woman. But she persevered and continued her good work. Was instrumental in discovering nuclear fission. Was nominated for Nobel prize 29 times by Niels Bohr.\nSummary - Getting started is the hard part.\n\nFriction and Viscosity\n\nMovement is a battle.\n\n\nFriction - force that opposes movement of objects that are in contact with each other. Overcoming friction needs extra energy.\nViscosity - Meausure of how hard it is to move through a liquid.\nTwo aspects - a) What is easy in one might be hard on another. b) Scale matters (a tiny fish has to try hard to move through viscous sea water which is much easier for a whale)\nE.g. - Agnes Pockels, 19th century physicist who studied on her own and succedeed in a higly viscous environment which was against women.\nE.g. - Chernobyl nuclear power plant issue - Viscous information environment made information flow very difficult and that resulted in millions getting killed.\nE.g. - Inefficiency at mass-production systems that were studied by Toyota. Friction to change. Lean methodology by Taiichi Ohno mitigates the problem by reducing the friction at the working level.\nSummary - There is always something trying to slow us down. Reducing resistance is often easier than using more force.\n\nVelocity\n\nDirection over speed.\n\n\nIt is much more important to pay attention to where you are going and not how fast you are moving.\nE.g. - Napoleon who was famous for his focus on speed towards a goal. This won him many battles. But the focus on this without accounting for factors that can limit it, can be dangerous. For e.g. Napoleon’s battle against Russia which was a failure since the distance was long and half the army died before reaching Moscow and had to return.\nE.g. - Mae West who was intensely focused on her career and diligently worked towards improving it. She was the highest woman earner in the U.S. at one point int time.\nSummary - Direction and speed are very important. We must adjust our tactics to continue towards our direction.\n\nLeverage\n\nEnough to move the world\n\n\nArchimedes - Said he could lift the Earth with the right lever.\nThree main types of physical levers - a) Force/Fulcrum/Weight (using a crowbar to open a door); b)Fulcrum/Weight/Force (wheelbarrow); c) Fulcrum/Force/Weight (baseball bat).\nRoger Volkema, in “Leverage”, two principles - a) perception, b) social construct\nWhen need to know three things - a) Do I have it? b) Where and when should I apply it? c) How do I keep it?\nE.g. - Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was Queen of France and then England, had a lot of influence through leverage that she learnt to wield.\nE.g. - The dark side of Leverage - The coal companies in West Virginia who kept the workers in ignorance and poverty.\nSummary - Simply working hard towards a path is probably not the right solution. The right one is to identify the appropriate levers use them appropriately to put effort in the right areas.\n\nChemistry\nActivation Energy\n\nGet to the end.\n\n\nActivation energy is the energy required for a chemical system to initiate and complete a reaction. Once heat is applied, molecules collide, the transition state is unstable and finally a new compound is created or the original ingredients are transformed.\nEvery reaction needs a minimum level of activation energy. One sheet of newspaper is not enough to start and sustain a fire in the fireplace. It may burn and then die out. It takes more paper, fires in multiple points to get the logs burning.\nBigger and more challenging something is, more activation energy is needed.\nE.g. - Getting out of addiction.\nE.g. - Thomas Sankara from Burkina Faso, a western African country who built a campaign, mobilizing support from the ground and overthrew the political system.\nE.g. - Countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand experienced periods of intense growth but only the first 3 succeeded in turning that into a sustainable long-term system.\nSummary - Determining and using the right amount of activation energy is crucial to making lasting changes. If the amount is not right, the change will fizzle out.\n\nCatalysts\n\nChange agent.\n\n\nCatalysts accelerate change. Without them, the actual change may take a significantly more time. Moreover, catalysts are not changed by the change that they bring about.\nE.g. - Catalytic converters in cars (diesel &amp; gas), alcohol manufacture, soap manufacture, Elizabeth Fulhame and her work on oxidation, Industrial Revolution, the printing press, the black death, private spaces in homes (Louis XV)\nSummary - People and technology often act as catalysts. The goal should be to either be a catalyst or use a catalyst to speed up transformations.\n\nAlloying\n\nGreater than the sum of its parts\n\n\nAlloy - A mixture, either in solution or compound, of two or more metals, or a metal and a nonmetal.\nE.g. - Sumerians made bronze (90% copper, 10% tin) which was better than copper or tin in isolation. Steel (iron + carbon) is much harder than pure iron.\nMedicine - A combination of two or more drugs could have a greater benefit than each drug separately.\nLife - We may not have all the skills needed to complete something. If we partner with someone, that creates an alloy which could be stronger than each.\nE.g. - Two men beating an army - Tecumseh a Shawnee chief and Isaac Brock, a Major-General in the British army, worked together to keep Americans out of Canadian territory.\nKnowledge is the ultimate alloy. We learn from others, the concepts that we learn are made stronger with experience.\nFive components of knowledge by Aristotle - science (episteme), art/craft (techne), practical knowledge (phronesis), intuitive apprehension (nous) and wisdom (sophia).\nE.g. - Leonardo da Vinci was a creative genius mainly because he combined knowledge from different disciples.\nSummary - With the right mixture, one + one can really equal ten. Alloying produces something that is greater than its parts.\n\nBiology\nEvolution Part One: Natural Selection and Extinction\n\nAdapt or die.\n\n\nNatural Selection - The frequency of traits within a population changes as a response to environmental conditions, resulting in species that are more adaptable to the environment.\nTwo species requiring the same resources cannot coexist in the same area.\nThere are over 10 million distinct species with only 20% being catalogued! So many species might be going extinct without us knowing.\nE.g. - Evolution of language. There have been thousands of languages over centuries and most are dead now. French is simpler and more adaptable than Latin. Hence it survived.\nSummary - The world is constantly changing and we need to adapt in order to survive.\n\nEvolution Part Two: Adaptation Rate and the Red Queen Effect\n\nGetting better all the time.\n\n\nAdaptation requires understanding the environment and what is changing in it.\nE.g. French in World War II were prepared for how they fought World War I and won and got defeated by Germany.\nThe Red Queen effect - “It takes all the running you can do, to be in the same place”. It is a sobering thought. Being lazy and not doing anything will set you back.\nApplication to Business - Competitors are always working to get ahead, Customers are changing, needs are changing, so one must always try to get ahead of oneself. Standing still means taking a setback.\nVestigial structures - If it does no harm, and doesn’t consume energy to maintain, don’t bother.\nExaptation - An animal produces something to adapt to some situation and that gets used for a totally different purpose. E.g. feathers in birds first provided heat and attractiveness and later got used to help in flight, Self-playing piano, remote-controlled torpedo.\nGreat quotes - “We don’t always know the value of something at the outset, and there doesn’t always have to be a justification for doing everything.”, “Having to know the benefit of everything before you begin leads to missed opportunities.”\nE.g. When Radium was invented, no one knew it could be used in hospitals. Play-Doh was used as wallpaper cleaner for 20 yrs before becoming a household toy, Botox is toxin that causes paralysis but is used to cure muscle and limb spasms.\nSummary - Adaptations and exaptations are part of a continuous process that are needed to survive in a changing world. Success comes from being flexible to change.\n\nEcosystem\n\nEverything is connected.\n\n\nEcosystem - Community of interacting species and their environment, an intricate web with multitude of dependencies.\nSaving an animal from extinction by breeding them in a cage is not as effective as protecting their ecosystem.\nKeystone animals and ones that play crucial role in the ecosystem and if their numbers dwindle, it could destroy the system.\nTrade ecosystem, 3 lessons -\n\na) If you try to close off a section of the system, it will self-organize in a different way. Story of China banning all trade fearing a weakening of power, but trade continued.\nb) When external factors come in, one needs to adapt. When trade opened up many adapted to producing Silk.\nc) Ecosystems are resilient - e.g. Chinese community in Manila.\n\n\ne.g. - Bill Walsh - created a culture that valued a well-functioning ecosystem that helped 49ers become champions.\nSummary - Everything is connected and small actions can have unintended consequences. Hence we must think before effecting a change.\n\nNiches\n\nFind a good fit.\n\n\nGeneralists can survive and flourish in any setting. Specialists thrive in stable conditions.\nConvergence - Features and behaviors are similar when conditions are similar. E.g. - Wings of bats and birds, features of species from different continents. The number of ways to fulfill a function is finite.\nThis could also mean that the same culture across difference places, could produce similar results.\nCoke is an example of being a generalist.\nSummary - There is a trade-off between specialization and generalization. Specialization means less stress but cannot survive in all conditions, while it is the opposite for generalization.\n\nSelf-Preservation\n\nSurvive to thrive.\n\n\nSelf-preservation a fundamental behavior to all organisms.\nAnimals do a lot of things to protect themselves. Many animals do selfless things for the self-preservation of the community or species.\nE.g. - Gioconda Belli and the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in the 1970s.\nE.g. - Derinkuyu: Turkey’s ancient underground city.\nSummary - Self-preservation is a core instinct that explains a lot of irrational things that we might do.\n\nReplication\n\nCopy, copy, copy.\n\n\nmitosis - making identical copy, meiosis - reproduction, creating new possibilities.\nE.g. - Habsburg family - They went into ruin due to generations of intermarriage.\nE.g. - Germans getting defeated by French. Four elements of commander’s intent: formulate, communicate, interpret, and implement. The key thing is to have flexibility to implement at the ground level.\nReplicating a culture - example of tea.\nWe don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Often a great starting point is from something that already exists.\n\nCooperation\n\nWork Together\n\n\nThis is similar to Alloying. The sum is greater than its parts. It is what really helped in the development of human civilization and build complex societies.\nDunbar Number\n\n5 people: Inner core of closeness. Partners, family, best friends.\n15 people: Close friend group.\n50 people: Basic friends and acquaintances.\n150 people: Part of a community.\n500 people: Friends of friends.\n1500 people: Upper limit which includes number of faces that you can put names to.\n\n\n\nHierarchical Organization\n\nKnow your place\n\n\nHierarchies can be found everywhere in the animal kingdom. E.g. Hens, Chimpanzees.\nPlato &amp; Plotinus - The entire universe is arranged in a hierarchical structure. Pebbles, soil, etc. at the bottom, plants, then animals, humans and god at the top.\nFrench society before the revolution had 3 estates : 1st Estate - Church and Clergy, 2nd Estate - Aristocracy, 3rd Estate - everyone else (~98%). During the revolution, a vast majority was in abject poverty. People overthrew the system and instilled another which was even worse. But in all subsequent systems, there was some kind of hierarchy.\nE.g. - Chile miners who formed their own hierarchy while trapped in a mine.\nSummary - Hierarchy is core to most animals. Lack of hierarchy and too much hierarchy leads to unrest.\n\nIncentives\n\nShape Behavior\n\n\nConsistent but infrequent rewards &gt; frequent rewards. infrequent rewards give better behavioral changes.\nDrive for incentives is everywhere. People decide on immediate rewards while voting or doing many things in life. CEOs with short tenure think of immediate goals, people with quarterly use-it-or-lose-it budget spend recklessly towards the end.\nE.g. - Thalidomide drug of the 50s. It was destructive but was sold in so many places across the world due to the incentives given to people in the sales and others in the middle. Luckily U.S got saved due to Dr. Frances Kelley.\nSummary - Incentive can shape behavior. We’re wired to respond to it. Companies, organizations focused on incentives can manipulate people into doing the wrong things.\n\nTendency to Minimize Energy Output\n\nLeast effort principle\n\n\nAll living beings have developed mechanisms to increase their energy efficiency. E.g. - turtles, sharks\nHeuristics - We take good enough decisions and not the best ones.\nSatisficing - We search for the first thing in our brain that satisfies our minimum acceptable conditions.\nRemember base rates and pay attention to quality of data.\nCubicle or not - Very good argument against open plan offices.\nSummary - We have a natural tendency to minimize energy. Sometimes it helps, many times it gets in the way of doing difficult things.\n\n\nBook cover Image Credit: Amazon\nFootnotes\n\n\nParrish, Shane, et al.

The book has a ton of facts and well researched material that he weaves into the story as a master folktale teller unraveling secrets one by one. There is so much packed into the book, it is mind boggling. The same was the case with Sapiens2. Also with 21 lessons3. This book provides a worldview by taking oneself totally out of it and looking at it as an objective observer, of the past and the future, something Harari asserts that only Homo Sapiens can do. It has a progressive outlook towards the endless possibilities of a brighter future but also has an ominous overtone.\nTLDR;\nThe book starts off by saying that humanity has all but solved the problems that killed people en masse in the past - disease, famine, and violence. The new agenda of the future would be to raise the stakes much higher and aim for - happiness, immortality, and divinity. Well, it is not too far away, the transformation of humans into gods is within reach. It is exciting as well as scary to think of the unimaginable world that humans are entering into.\nProvocative Statements\nThe strength of the book is in the way Harari constructs words to convey meaning. Some of them are so intense that they give you a jolt. There are many unbelievably provocative yet deeply true statements.\nTake for instance something that he says when he describes human relationship with animals in the past.\n“We are suddenly showing unprecedented interest in the fate of so-called lower life forms, perhaps because we are about to become one.”\nOops!!\nHarari says that throughout our history, most humans never gave much consideration about other animals. They were there to serve mankind, as food or labor. Many religions went to great lengths to assert the dominance of humans over other creatures justifying mindless killing for sacrifice or sport. The realization that Artificial Intelligence or Superhumans of the future might treat normal humans as lower life forms, was profound!\nAnother instance is when he compares the Theory of Relativity which is tough to understand vs the Theory of Evolution which is much easier to grasp.\n“The Theory of Relativity makes nobody angry because it doesn’t contradict any of our cherished beliefs”. But the Theory of Evolution makes a lot of people angry because it contradicts the long cherished belief of existence of soul and all the creation myths. The concept of soul and all the theology around it in different religions is so difficult to understand but people defend it with their lives in opposition to Evolution.\nOr consider this statement -\n“People who believe in the hi-tech Ark should not be put in charge of the global ecology, for the same reason that people who believe in a heavenly afterlife should not be given nuclear weapons.” Wow!\nWas reminded of this scene in Westworld Season 2 finale (The Passenger). The hosts see an open gateway at the edge of a cliff and they run to it. The moment they jump in, their consciousness is uploaded into a virtual world and they are very happy but in reality, they are jumping off the cliff edge to their demise! People who have their lives locked into a strong belief in afterlife could blow up everyone and there could just be a void after that! Of course, suicide bombers are scary, but scarier are the people who believe that whatever ecological catastrophe happens, they have an ark or an underground bunker or a colony in Mars to escape into!\nNew Religion\nWhat Harari says about Dataism as the new religion is something that we can identify with. We’re seeing it all around. Everything is just a huge data processing system.\nI was taken aback by his theory around consciousness though. Is it just mental pollution? Here is a quote from the book -\n\n“Consciousness is the biologically useless by-product of certain brain processes. Jet engines roar loudly, but the noise doesn’t propel the aeroplane forward. Humans don’t need carbon dioxide, but each and every breath fills the air with more of the stuff. Similarly, consciousness may be a kind of mental pollution produced by the firing of complex neural networks. It doesn’t do anything. It is just there.”\n\nI don’t quite agree. But it is something to think about for sure.\nOverall, it is an engaging read. You might agree or disagree with a lot of points in the book but it does make you look at things from a different point of view and force an internal dialogue.\nAfterthoughts\nThe title of this post references a famous quote from Robert Browning -\n\n“Ah, a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?”\nfrom Andrea del Sarto 4 By Robert Browning.\n\nThe quote implies that we should try to achieve things beyond what we can hold on to, but we might not be able to reach heaven. I think the book points to the the possibility that in future, humans might go beyond what even the wildest notions of heaven that we have currently.\nThough I agree with many points in the book, I can’t agree with everything. Though Harari is a great scholar, some things seem to be subjective opinions.\nRather than believing that the world is an empty void of eternity, I’d like to believe that we catapult ourselves towards being spacefaring beings that can travel anywhere in this vast Universe, like in the TV series The Expanse5. I’d like to believe that we’d find out more about telepathy, astral projection and other non-understood phenomena, like when Murph discovers that the Ghost in the bookshelf that she was interacting with, was Cooper from future (sorry for the spoiler alert from Interstellar6).\nAs an aside, while we’re talking about Interstellar, here is a thrilling scene from the movie.\n{{&lt; youtube a3lcGnMhvsA &gt;}}\nSeeing the scene or just listening to the soundtrack or live performance is simply inspiring. Napoleon famously said “The word impossible is not in my dictionary”, but Cooper’s “No, It’s necessary” in answer to CASE’s “It’s not possible” could go down as one of the greatest dialogues in movie history.\nNotes\nListing down the TOC and the headings of different sections to jog the memory for myself or anyone who wants to recollect the concepts in the book.\nIntroduction\n1 The New Human Agenda\n\nThe Biological Poverty Line\nInvisible Armadas\nBreaking the Law of the Jungle\nThe Last Days of Death\nThe Right to Happiness\nThe Gods of Planet Earth\nCan Someone Please Hit the Breaks?\nThe Paradox of Knowledge\nA Brief History of Lawns\nA Gun in Act I\n\nPART I Homo Sapiens Conquers the World\nQuestions - What is the difference between humans and all other animals?

Because, if you never admit you’re unhappy with something, then you never have to change anything.\nMost of us don’t speak up when we’re dissatisfied and then things just accumulate until you can’t really imagine an alternative.”\n~ John Wilson in Scaffolding (Episode 2 of ‘How to with John Wilson’1)\n\nThe quote above and so many such hard-truths and reflections about life is what makes watching the documentary ‘How to with John Wilson’, an experience worth having. I would say that his brilliance was in the shots that he captured to make his points. When he is voicing over the above statement about “we don’t speak up when we’re dissatisfied”, he shows a man having a haircut (hinting that he is unhappy but sitting there and letting the hairstylist do his job with the machine) and then, as he is saying “things just accumulate”, he shows footage of a woman covered almost fully in pigeons! She probably meant to feed a couple of them and then so many birds swoop in!\nIt is as though he casually stumbles into footages of interesting storefronts, overflowing garbage bins, people arguing, animals pooping, etc. as he wanders around New York City, talking to himself loudly. But I’m sure he has picked the right footage to say the right thing. His dry humor is something that cannot be explained. One has to see and hear.\nThe series as a whole is a bit depressing to watch, sometimes revolting, but definitely is thought-provoking. It is like having an intelligent friend who makes sarcastic, yet insightful comments about the state of the world and society once in a while as he is talking. Also, it shows a side of New York that most outsiders may never know. Sometimes one wonders if it is part of a city from a third world country!\nNow to the topic at hand, Scaffolding. I’ve been to NYC a few times, mostly on business in past jobs. I’ve always wondered why so many places were in perpetual construction. When one sees interlocking aluminum pipes forming a frame to support something, one thinks of something being repaired or built. Through the documentary, I got to know that scaffolding is in place to protect people from objects falling from high rises. Wow, it is a problem that is unique to places which have high rise buildings. I never thought of it that way and it was an ‘aha’ moment.\nWilson says that the death of a person due to something that fell on his/her head back in 1979 spawned this $8 billion a year industry! Scaffoldings look that way (unfinished) because they are supposed to be temporary. But these are in no way temporary and there are many scaffoldings that have been there for over 20 years! And now, many people probably die because of scaffolding breaking and falling on them!\nAt one point, Wilson says - “You can end a relationship that offers you nothing or.. you can just stay in it indefinitely because it is too hard to move on.” and he shows a lonely lady sitting on a stool and smoking while looking at the pedestrians in the most uninspired manner!\nThe city’s relationship with scaffolding is not serving its original noble purpose of protecting people but it cannot be removed at all due to all the other forces, especially business interests, at play. So you end up with an ugly looking structure that obscures views, obstructs people walking, doesn’t allow light to get to plants, and also kills people!\nThere are many other quips of his that made me think later. Especially when he compares different aspects of life with scaffolding. “Money jobs can operate like a kind of scaffolding, providing brief support, but stick with them long enough and they can become central to what you do and who you are.” Yeah, someone could take up a job as an Uber driver or taxi driver temporarily to make ends meet, but get stuck in that.\nIn another instance, he compares images of buildings like Flatiron building, Plaza Hotel, Tiffany’s, etc. portrayed in the movies where they show the signage at the top and the imposing tall structures but in reality, they look ugly with the scaffolding at the ground level. It is true - Movies tuck away the ugliness in the world and sell beauty that is not there.\nOf course, it is one thing to be critical about these structures and wish to have them vanish but I couldn’t help but think if the people at the bottom do need protection from people at the top. Not just literally but from all walks of life. In Greek mythology, gods fought against themselves but in most cases, it was the people below who suffered, In medieval Europe, when kings had differences in opinion, the public ended up starving to support wars that cleaned up the exchequer, In today’s times, when a President wants to quash his predecessor’s medical policy, millions suffer due to lack of medical coverage, When VPs in a company fight and a particular division gets shuttered, normal employees get laid off but the VP might walk away with a huge severance package, and so on. When people at the top fight and throw things or cast their opponents down, everything seems to fall on the hapless pedestrians. So, ugly or not, something is needed. But not too much.\nI could go on. But let me end the post with another beautiful quote from the episode that Wilson says towards the end -\n\nYou can waste your entire life playing it safe. But the real danger is what you never expect it to be.\nAnd if you put up too much scaffolding to protect yourself, you might just end up buried underneath it.\n\n\nImage Credit - Flickr - flic.kr/p/9KtoQY - Scaffolding City by Devyn Caldwell.\nFootnotes\n\n\nwww.hbo.com/how-to-with-john-wilson ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-11-14---The-Queen's-Gambit-and-the-feeling-of-nostalgia":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-11-14---The-Queen's-Gambit-and-the-feeling-of-nostalgia","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-11-14 - The Queen's Gambit and the feeling of nostalgia.md","title":"The Queen's Gambit and the feeling of nostalgia","links":[],"tags":["Chess","TV-Series","Netflix","Drama","blog"],"content":"\n“It’s foolish to run the risk of going mad for vanity’s sake.”\n~ French Philosopher Diderot (From Netflix’s “The Queen’s Gambit” 1)\n\nThe Dream\nFor the first time in so many years, I had a dream about Chess. Like many dreams, it is in the mind and is kind of difficult to exactly describe it. But, here is the idea - I was a piece moving on a large Chessboard crowded with a lot of pieces, trying to figure out how to navigate. At the same time, I was also the invisible hand from above that was pondering how to move not just myself but also the other pieces. I suddenly realized that I had the power to move other pieces. Wow! The joy was short-lived when I realized that even if I move the other pieces, I could still lose like I’ve lost many times while playing with myself. I’ve played a lot of games with myself and what I’ve many times found is, even though I’m thinking for my opponent and anticipating the moves, I sometimes come up with a move that I didn’t think of before. It is like a particular pathway or a set of moves for the opponent becomes visible only after I make my move!\nThe dream was probably because yesterday I had finished watching The Queen’s Gambit1 on Netflix which was based on Walter Tevis’s book2 by the same name. To say that it was exciting would be an understatement. It was mind-blowing and in many ways, personal. It took me back to a time when I was actively playing Chess. I’d define ‘Active’ as playing at least an hour on a daily basis or for 10 hours or so on the weekends. Active to me, means immersed in something so that it appears in my dream in some form. Most of my dreams in the last decade or so has been about work and all things related to it. In fact, I had dreams about projects, teams and meetings even two months after I left my last job since I was so deep into it.\nThe beauty of Chess\nThe beauty of Chess is that it is not a game about merely winning or losing, but enjoying the journey to the goal. It is about the strategies that are uncovered during the ups and downs of the game. Like in life, we’re sometimes surprised by the moves our opponents make, taken aback more by foolish ones than brilliant ones. We realize that we sometimes give undue importance to others and place them above us when it is not needed. Many times, we’re even surprised by the moves we make. It comes like a lightning at a certain point. Sometimes when we look at a bad position, we realize that it is the effect of a bad move 10 moves in the past. We realize that one bad move in a game or in life, could chart us towards a path from which there is no deliverance. We then pray for the opponent to make a mistake like gambler waiting for a lottery ticket win to restore his fortunes.\nAs we play many games and grow in our abilities, we realize that the greatest enablers in our life were never the spectator-fans who cheered us in the sidelines but the opponents at the other end who beat us and dared us to rise up again or others who valiantly tried to match us till the end.\nNostalgia - My First Chess Book\nFew things make me nostalgic as discussing books or playing Chess. Maybe many years later I might also begin to be nostalgic about my 24x7 work style in the last couple of decades. There was a thrill to it, of course. After finding time to read a lot of books in the last few months and now seeing a series on Chess, I realize what I missed in the last 15 years. It is a great feeling to be transported to a time when your day was different and when you were a different person. It is like the joy that one feels while looking at journal entries from the past.\nYesterday, I looked at the Chess books that I have on my bookshelf, and leafed through the first book that I’d ever read on Chess - Chess Master V Chesss Amateur3 by Max Euwe and Walter Meiden. It has notations in the old format and looks so old!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \nThere are 25 chapters, each dealing with a famous Chess Opening or a variant of it. I had crossed out Queen’s Gambit as an opening that I didn’t like! All my initial games were e4 (P-K4) with opponents playing either knight-bishop variants or fianchetto variants. So, when I encountered Queen’s Gambit for the first time in high school, I wasn’t quite prepared for it. It seemed like an odd opening. The book made it familiar though.\nThe book also made me visualize a Chess game as someone who is rowing upstream from the mouth of a river. A river with a million tributaries upstream. You could take any path and go through a stream into a forest that you’re unfamiliar with. The key is to play as many games as possible, mostly in your head and visualize the paths and become familiar. There is no fear of the unknown when you’re familiar with the terrain.\nI spent a lot of time today walking down the memory lane from my first Chess game with a bachelor in my lane, others in my locality, friends in high school, friends in engineering and at work, some competitions, etc. It all seemed so far away. The last game of Chess that I played was with my niece when I visited Bangalore a couple of years back.\nThe point is that something that is central to one’s life at this point in time need not be so in a couple of decades.\nQueen’s Gambit, the Netflix series\nThough I got nostalgic and went on a tangent, the main intent of writing this post was to make a list of all the books mentioned in the series and may be a list of all the openings. The best thing is, I found so many articles online by people who were passionate about the series and wrote at length about the games in the book. The articles in chessbase.in4 by Shahid Ahmed where he goes over every game in every episode and one in Medium by Kurry Tran5 who gives a detailed breakdown of the final match with Borgov, were astounding.\nThe titles of each episode are so meaningful. Each reference an important stage in a chess game as well an important time in Beth’s life. There are 7 episodes with titles as Openings, Exchanges, Doubled Pawns, Middle Game, Fork, Adjournment, End Game.\nThe first episode3 has Mr.Shaibel giving Beth a book named “Modern Chess Openings” and talking about Scholar’s Mate,  The Sicilian Defense, The Levenfish Variation, The Najdorf Variation and The Queen’s Gambit. The number of openings and books mentioned only go up after this and it is a relish to watch.\nMore than anything, the most enjoyable bits were the commentaries by people when games were being played. The commentators were super passionate and one could feel the tension in the people who were watching the games.\nWhen I saw the scene of a street in Russia full of tables with old people playing, it gave a glimpse of an ideal retirement place and activity for me. The series ends with Beth playing with one of those people in the street. How idyllic!\nBooks mentioned in the series\nThis is not an exhaustive list. There are a lot of references to books and booklets that contain games played between GMs. The series drives home the point that studying games of masters is very critical to having a profound understanding of the game. Modern Chess Openings (MCO) is referenced so many times and it is not surprising that the book (15th Edition) is out of stock on Amazon!\nEpisode 1 - Openings4\n\nModern Chess Openings6 by Griffith and White\n\nEpisode 2 - Exchanges7\n\n\nMy Chess Career8 by José Raúl Capablanca\n\n\nPawn Power in Chess9 by Hans Kmoch\n\n\nModern Chess Openings10 by Walter Korn\n\n\nBooks that Beth sees in the Bookshop (from the book11)\n\nPaul Morphy and the Golden Age of Chess12\nWinning Chess Traps13\nHow to Improve Your Chess14\nAttack and Counterattack15 in Chess (She buys this for $2.99)\n\n\n\nEpisode 3 - Doubled Pawns16\n\nNo mention of a specific book\n\nEpisode 4 -  Middle Game17\n\nBasic Chess Endings18 by Reuben Fine\n\nEpisode 5 - Fork19\n\nMy Chess Career8 by J.R.

This was in response to the Queen saying that Thatcher is making a lot of enemies. Thatcher replies that it is inevitable to make enemies. She says, “If you’ve not made enemies, you’ve been a coward in the fight.” Gillian Anderson plays the role of Thatcher to perfection, and this scene was exceptional. I felt compelled to immediately Google this poem and read it. Here is the poem.\nNo Enemies by Charles Mackay 2\n\nYOU have no enemies, you say?\nAlas! my friend, the boast is poor;\nHe who has mingled in the fray\nOf duty, that the brave endure,\nMust have made foes! If you have none,\nSmall is the work that you have done.\nYou’ve hit no traitor on the hip,\nYou’ve dashed no cup from perjured lip,\nYou’ve never turned the wrong to right,\nYou’ve been a coward in the fight.\n\nIt reminded me of poems like Invictus by Henley and If by Kipling. Definitely should add this to my list of Favorite Poems.\nReflections\nThe poem set me thinking about whether it is truly inevitable to make enemies. It is probably part of the human condition to deal with virtues as well as the vices of people around us. Some could be kind to us during our struggles, some could see it as an opportunity to crush us further, some could be happy at our success, some could be jealous, and so on. As civilization progresses, there are more resources available, a lesser percentage of people go hungry, and fewer percentages live below the poverty line. So it probably does mean that there is less strife than before. Lesser number of wars and unnecessary killings. Books like “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined” and 2020-01-04 - Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think, clearly show the decline of violence over the years and the progress in humanity. So I think more people can now afford to live relatively peaceful lives without having any real enemies.\nBut even though the percentage is less, there is still a lot of strife, violence, bigotry, oppression, and injustice in the world. One can make a conscious choice to take up a cause and fight for a section of the oppressed. While some people have to make a conscious choice to get out of being a spectator, some are thrust into it. They are mostly the people who are in the affected group or people who are moved by the plight of the oppressed. During her time, Thatcher fought not only against the aristocracy but also prejudice against women. There are so many such examples of people who have faced insurmountable odds and prevailed. They are the heroes that we can always learn from every time we need to stand up for something we think is right.\nCharles Mackay\nI didn’t know about Charles Mackay before I went in search of this poem after watching this episode. He was an extraordinary person. He was a Scottish poet, journalist, author, anthologist, novelist, and songwriter 3. He was famous for the songs he wrote and for this book titled Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds 4.\nThe title of the book was so engaging that I thought I would read about it. Quite an interesting book. The book was published in three volumes: “National Delusions”, “Peculiar Follies”, and “Philosophical Delusions”, and he debunks popular beliefs on alchemy, crusades, economic bubbles, fortune-telling, haunted houses, magnetizers, prophecies, tulip mania, witch mania, etc.\nI feel like I should read this book at some point in time, even though a lot of it is historical and not relevant now. I also think that a book such as this should be published every decade. New fads keep coming up, and people seem to follow them in droves. At the present time, it seems like the Internet, especially social media, is filled with misinformation despite the best intentions of big companies to use their resources to filter them out. Maybe it is not humanly possible to even consolidate all the delusions out there today. Hence relying on AI or systems that can crunch large amounts of data and make sense out of them is probably the only option. But what if the AI itself is biased. I guess if the human species has been self-correcting over the course of time, one can be optimistic that even AI can.\n\nImage Credit - NASA HQ PHOTO - Mars 2020 Perseverance Launch via Flickr (flic.kr/p/2jrgXJa)\nFootnotes\n\n\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt9812668/ ↩\n\n\nwww.bartleby.com/71/1517.html ↩ ↩2\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mackay_(author) ↩\n\n\nwww.gutenberg.org/files/24518/24518-h/24518-h.htm ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-12-12---His-Dark-Materials":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-12-12---His-Dark-Materials","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-12-12 - His Dark Materials.md","title":"His Dark Materials","links":[],"tags":["Poem","TV-Series","Fiction","Fantasy","blog"],"content":"\n“Into this wild abyss,\nThe womb of nature and perhaps her grave,\nOf neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,\nBut all these in their pregnant causes mixed\nConfusedly, and which thus must ever fight,\nUnless the almighty maker them ordain\nHis dark materials to create more worlds,\nInto this wild abyss the wary fiend\nStood on the brink of hell and looked a while,\nPondering his voyage.”\n~ John Milton, Paradise Lost Book 2, lines 910–920 1\n\nFinished watching the last episode of the second season of His Dark Materials2 on HBO. I haven’t read the books and made a mental note to read them sometime next year. Also set me thinking of other YA novels that I’ve read and enjoyed. Movies made from YA novels and comics are the blockbuster movies that everyone is drawn to. There is something universally appealing about ‘coming of age’ stories and those full of adventures at every turn.\nThe most recent YA book/series that I read (albeit a couple of years ago) was a book from ‘Lockwood and Co’ series named ‘The Streaming Staircase’ by Jonathan Stroud. I think Jonathan Stroud’s books, especially ‘The Bartimaeus Trilogy’ are a notch above the Harry Potter series. I do like Harry Potter, though, (both the books and the movies). Other series that come to mind are ‘The Hunger Games’, ‘Twilight’ and ‘Divergent’. I’ve watched the movies. Haven’t read Hunger Games or Twilight but read the Divergent series.\nThe earliest coming of age book that I’ve read is Great Expectations by Dickens. I re-read it again last year and realized so many things that I had missed when I read it long ago. Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew also come to mind when I think of YA fiction. I might have read 50 to 100 Hardy boys, but don’t remember much at all. Other books that come to mind are ‘Little Women’, ‘The Chronicles of Narnia’,’ Catcher in the Rye’,’ To Kill a Mocking Bird’ and so on. Probably should make a list at a later point in time.\nBack to ‘His Dark Materials’, the title is taken from a phrase in Paradise Lost by Milton3. I have the book but haven’t read it fully. I’ve read a summary of the book and read random pages. The beauty of reading Milton is that if you just read it, you’d understand it even though there may be a lot of arcane words or references that you know nothing about. You may not get the inner meaning or references to other mythology, but you’d get the gist of the scene itself. It is like what Adler says in ‘How to read a book’, one must just read a book in a flow, without stopping to look at a dictionary or other references. At least in the first reading. That is so true. There is no joy greater than sitting with a book and being completely immersed in it, going with the flow of the book.\nWhen you read the quoted paragraph above, you can at once visualize Satan standing on the brink of the gate to hell and looking out into the abyss and feeling the distance between hell and heaven and pondering how he could make the trip to the new world created by God.\nI wonder how Milton had this vision of a chaotic universe and earth being created out of the chaos. He says things will be in a perpetual state of fight until a world is created from dark matter and there is peace. Something to think about. The turmoil that we see on the earth is nothing in comparison to the heat inside the stars or the primordial earth when everything was molten.\nThe TV series is good, the music in the opening sequence is great, the actors are top-notch, some of the settings are breathtaking. But I’ve read that it still doesn’t fully capture that complete complexity of the novels. Hopefully will read it before the next season comes.\n—\nImage Credit - Wikipedia - Satan struggles through hell in a Gustave Doré illustration of Paradise Lost.\nFootnotes\n\n\nwww.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45738/paradise-lost-book-2-1674-version ↩\n\n\nwww.hbo.com/his-dark-materials ↩\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials#Titles ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2020/2020-12-19---The-Phoenix-Project":{"slug":"Blog/2020/2020-12-19---The-Phoenix-Project","filePath":"Blog/2020/2020-12-19 - The Phoenix Project.md","title":"The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win by Gene Kim, et al.","links":["Book-Notes/Fiction/Goldratt---The-Goal"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Software-Engineering","Business","Leadership","Information-Technology","book-notes","blog"],"content":"\n“Like matter and antimatter, in the presence of unplanned work, all planned work ignites with incandescent fury, incinerating everything around it.”\n~ Gene Kim, The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win1\n\nThe book makes the case for proper planning, rigor, and discipline as an antidote to getting out of the impossible quagmire of technical debt, tightly coupled systems and unachievable product deadlines. The world is moving fast and successful companies usually grow much faster than anyone in the company can envision, usually in unanticipated directions. Of course, it is always better to have a messy system that serves customers than a clean system that does not have customers. A road full of potholes can serve the purpose of taking someone from one point to another but it is a toil, harmful for the vehicles and the people, and it only gets worse with time leading to despair. Work has to be joyful and a smooth build and release pipeline should be the last of the worries for engineers.\nWas reminded of this quote from Dave Thomas’s2 talk on “Agile is Dead (Long live Agility)”3 -\n\n“99% of software projects looked like this [picture of revolutionaries with guns], valiant people manning the barricades, do-or-die, mostly die. Chaos, smoke, gunfire, death - that was your average software project, and clearly that’s not sustainable. It’s fun and you get to wear cool uniforms but it’s not sustainable.”\n\nThrough engaging story telling, “The Phoenix Project” takes the reader from visualizing a situation of complete disarray where the company is failiing financially, not able to launch things on time and people are overworked, to seeing an ideal state where everthing, including the unpredictable things, are predictably executed. Most of the situations that the characters go through will evoke a sense of déjà vu for folks who have been active in Software development in the last couple of decades, especially in ‘online consumer’ companies. Many of the situations and dialogues might seem forced and a bit artificial. But overall, it is a good read and recommended reading for most engineers. It is a fast read and almost unputdownable.\nI look back to a time when downloading code from clearcase repository, doing a build and starting the server could take almost a day sometimes. Now everything is so fast that it seems magical. The ability to clone a random repository from github and have it up an running in minutes is nothing short of extraordinary. The story underscores the importance of incredible feeling that one gets when things go smooth everytime and things get done as per expectations.\nInspired from ‘The Goal’4\nFor those who have read Goldratt - The Goal, this book will seem very familiar. In fact, the structure is quite the same and the authors do give credit to “Sensei Goldratt” in a few places. When you read the beginning, you know how it will end but it is the journey that makes it fascinating. I’ve been involved in multiple large scale software migrations, most of them being backend services that handled billions of API calls per day and had huge blast radii. It is usually not the question of what the end goal is but about handling situations that arise during the migration. It is like you’re on one bank of a river and want to get to the other bank. You get on the bridge and realize midway (or earlier) that it is incomplete. You’ve got to figure out how to bridge the gap in the bridge.\nBill Palmer, VP of IT, who is the central character, figures out how to get out of many difficult situations by thinking through questions raised by Dr. Erik, who is similar to the Jonah, the ‘Yoda’ like person from ‘The Goal’. He comes up with the four types of work just by the prodding questions from Dr. Erik. In the same way, Bill graps the concept of Goldratt’s “Theory of Constraints” and works out that a brilliant engineer like Brent who is called for every important thing and is always overworked, is actually one of the bottlenecks. Using TOC, the team identifies bottlenecks in the system and introduces continuous integration and deployement thereby improving the flow of work.\nHere are some concepts from the book.\nThe Four Types of Work\n\nBusiness Projects - Much needed for the business to survive, driven by market forces and business leadership within the company.\nInternal Projects - Also called as “Platform projects”, these are technical in nature and involve upgrades, rearchitectures, patches, etc. The technology landscape is changing so fast that no adopting the right technology can have huge impacts to business deliverables. Say - not having Disaster Recovery (DR) capability and being unavailable for customers, or exposing customer data due to a security breach, could destroy the business.\nChanges - Bug fixes, updates, improvements generated by first two types of work. Changes can be anticipated and handled usina a process like Kanban.\nUnplanned Work - It is invisible force that drags everything else down. If something that is done has to be redone because the implementation was faulty, that is usually not accounted for. The quote at the beginning of this post is said in this context. “Like matter and antimatter, in the presence of unplanned work, all planned work ignites with incandescent fury, incinerating everything around it.” Phew!\n\nThe Three Ways\nAt the end of the novel is a section fully dedicated to explaining the Three Ways in detail. It is taken from the follow-on book ‘The DevOps Handbook’.\n\nThe First Way — Principles of Flow - Continuously improve the flow of work. Make work visible, limit work-in-progress (lean principle), reduce batch sizes, reduce hand-offs, remove bottlenecks and waste.\nThe Second Way — Principles of Feedback - ‘Fail fast’ and build new knowledge fast, move quality closer to the source. Build a strong feedback loop by shortening the bridge between operations (or customer support) and development.\nThe Third Way — Principles of Continuous Learning - Improve daily work and reduce toil, embrace a learning culture, try out new things, learn from failures.\n\nNotable Quotes\n\n“Until code is in production, no value is actually being generated, because it’s merely WIP stuck in the system.”\n\n\n“Left unchecked, technical debt will ensure that the only work that gets done is unplanned work!”\n\n\n“Remember, outcomes are what matter — not the process, not controls, or, for that matter, what work you complete.”\n\n\n“Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.”\n\n\n“Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system.”\n\n\n“Features are always a gamble. If you’re lucky, ten percent will get the desired benefits.”\n\n\n“Any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion.”\n\n\n“To tell the truth is an act of love. To withhold the truth is an act of hate. Or worse, apathy.”\n\n\n“Practice creates habits, and habits create mastery of any process or skill.”\n\n\n“You get what you design for.”\n\n\n“Every work center is made up of four things: the machine, the man, the method, and the measures.”\n\n\n“There should be absolutely no way that the Dev and QA environments don’t match the production environment.”\n\n\n“It’s not the upfront capital that kills you, it’s the operations and maintenance on the back end.”\n\n\n“But problems, like dog poop left in the rain, rarely get better just by ignoring them.”\n\n\n“IT is not merely a department. Instead, it’s pervasive, like electricity. It’s a skill, like being able to read or do math.”\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nKim, G., Behr, K., &amp; Spafford, K. (2014).

Great things are achieved by embracing great dangers. These were the words of Xerxes, Persia’s king of kings ..”\n— Admiral Emil Sauveterre, Season 5, Ep 2: Churn\n\nMulti-planetary humans\nWhen I think of a few of my favorite Sci-fi TV Series / Books - Battlestar Galactica, Foundation, Dune, Expanse - all of these (and more) created universes where humans are multi-planetary. They also they tend to point out that how much ever we accelerate forward technologically, the political, religious, economic and spiritual struggles continue. The worst human social issues of today - bigotry, racism, poverty, despotism, inequality, mass killing, etc. existed thousands of years ago and will most probably exist in the future too.\nThe fight between ‘good’ and ‘evil’ is many times the fight against the unknown. As they say, history is penned by the survivors (winners mostly) and what gets romanticized and told over again (in fact and fiction) are stories of small armies winning against large ones.\nThe Expanse S5 Episode 4 - Gaugamela\nIn Season 5, Episode 4 of The Expanse, perhaps this is what Marco envisioned as his legacy. A small army winning and taking control. A renegade faction of the Belters (residents of asteroid belt, laborers who are mainly involved in mining and other activities for resources that people on Earth and Mars need) who are generally viewed as second-class citizens by the rest of the world, launch an attack on the superpowers like Earth and Mars. When everything is in shambles and disarray, we hear Marco Inaros’ speech claiming responsibility for the attacks.\nThe Speech1\n{{&lt; alert theme=“danger” &gt;}}\nMy name is Marco Inaros. I am the commander of the Free Navy. We are the military arm and voice of the outer planets, and we are the ones responsible for striking our oppressors on Earth and Mars.\nThis attack was retribution for generations of atrocities committed by the Inners against innocent Belters. No longer will Belters be persecuted and subjected to the savagery and inhumanity that the Inners have been poisoning our species with.\nAny further attacks on Earth and Mars will be precipitated by the inner planets’ failure to recognize this new human reality. The Free Navy now possesses the last remaining sample of the protomolecule. Any transgressions by the Inners, and the Free Navy will not hesitate to unleash the protomolecule on either planet.\nWe recognize the right of Earth and Mars to exist, but their sovereignty ends at their respective atmospheres. The vacuum, the Ring Gates, and the Ring Worlds belong to the Belt, to Belters.\nWith the opening of the alien gates, we are at a crossroads in human history. Already, we are seeing how easy it would be to carry on legacies of exploitation, injustice, prejudice, and oppression into the new worlds, but there is a better path.\nUnder the protection of the Free Navy, the society and culture of the Belt will begin again and remake humanity without the corruption, greed, and hatred that the inner planets could not transcend.\nWe will take what is ours by right, yes, but more than that, we will lead the Belt to a new, better form, a more human form. Citizens of the Belt, baratnas, rise up now in joy and glorious resolve.\nThis day is ours.\nTomorrow is ours.\nThe future of humanity is ours.\nToday and forevermore… we are free.\n{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}\nThe facade of charisma\nMarco makes a grand speech that displays a lot of selflessness but we the audience that it is not the case. He is selfish and cunning and puts his personal agenda above the belter’s cause, though the people who follow him don’t know this. It is quite tough to be not swayed by charismatic leaders with excellent oratory skills. People put them on a pedestal and are willing to follow every word that they say. So the betrayal that is felt when the duplicitous nature of a charismatic leader is revealed, is deep. Here is a quote from Drucker on the dangers of purely relying on charisma of a leader.\n\n“The three most charismatic leaders in this century inflicted more suffering on the human race than almost any trio in history: Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. What matters is not the leader’s charisma. What matters is the leader’s mission.”\n~ Peter F. Drucker\n\nThe Expanse\nThough what prompted me to write this post was me thinking about the destructive capabilities of charismatic leaders, I realize that I could write at length about the series itself. The whole series is super inspirational and captivating. Working and walking in space, living in outer planets or asteroids, space flight, etc. are shown with a lot of authenticity.\nAt the core of the story is the human urge to be pioneers, to go where no one has gone before, to beat the odds and emerge victorious. It starts off at a time where humanity has already terraformed Mars, are mining minerals and other resources from the asteroids and have settlements in the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. But the terrain and the separation in space make people evolve into different cultures who increasingly view others with the lens of “us vs them”. There is a cold war between the super powers - Earth &amp; Mars and it feels like war and total destruction is imminent. There is a huge resentment that has been building up over decades between the Belters and the people of Earth and Mars, since they feel that they have been oppressed and exploited.\nInto this tense situation “protomolecule”, a virus-like alien technology, gets out of hand. After lying dormant for millions of years in one of Saturn’s moon’s, it is discovered by some scientists doing research. It is extremely deadly and kills anyone it comes in contact with. The entire population of the asteroid Eros get decimated when protomolecule infects just a few people. We later come to know that killing half a million people was intentional and it was a controlled experiment! On the surface, people from all the planets want to completely destroy it and yet want to retain some portion of it in a lab as a weapon against others.\nBut the experiment to study this ‘virus’ goes awry and people learn that protomolecule has something like a hive mind of its own. It takes control of the asteroid including the communication systems and starts moving by itself. It crashes into Venus, comes out and builds into a large gateway outside of Saturn’s orbit creating doorways to millions of other planets. That creates a huge gold rush of sorts where people are eager to go through the gates to explore new planets.\nHere is a great quote from one of the books in the series. A lot to think about.\n\n“It killed humans, therefore it was a weapon. But radiation killed humans, and a medical X-ray machine wasn’t intended as a weapon. Holden was starting to feel like they were all monkeys playing with a microwave. Push a button, a light comes on inside, so it’s a light. Push a different button and stick your hand inside, it burns you, so it’s a weapon. Learn to open and close the door, it’s a place to hide things. Never grasping what it actually did, and maybe not even having the framework necessary to figure it out. No monkey ever reheated a frozen burrito. So here the monkeys were, poking the shiny box and making guesses about what it did.”\n\n\nJames S.A.

As Simon Singh says in the book - “The Last Theorem is at the heart of an intriguing saga of courage, skulduggery, cunning, and tragedy, involving all the greatest heroes of mathematics.” Kudos to him for writing such an engaging book.\nAlso, the book references so many other books that just going through the titles is very enriching. It is like going to the favorite section of a library and looking at all the titles that you want to read at some point. At the end of the book, there is a section named “Suggestions for further reading”. Going through the list is like recalling many notable incidents and stories in the book.\nHere are some notes from me on each chapter. The title of each chapter is quite interesting and makes you want to read to find out what is inside.\n1. “I Think I’ll Stop Here”\n\nJune 23, 1993, Cambridge - Andrew Wiles is presenting his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem at the Newton Institute in his hometown of Cambridge.\nThe Last Problem - The book goes into a flashback, to a time when 10-year old Wiles discovered The Last Problem, by E.T. Bell in a library. This sparked his life-long passion to solve Fermat’s last theorem. Then it goes into the origins of this problem, starting with Pythagoras. Many pages are dedicated to Pythagoras and the Pythagoras Brotherhood. It was fascinating to know how extraordinary and influential Pythagoras really was. He probably treated numbers as friends like Ramanujam did. It talks about Perfect numbers (sum of divisors = the number), defective numbers (sum of divisors &lt; the number), excessive numbers (sum of divisors &gt; the number). It was great to know that powers of two - 4, 8, 16, 32 are slightly defective (sum of divisors = the number - 1) and that there are no numbers that are slightly excessive (sum of divisors = the number + 1). Intriguing tidbits.\nEverything is Number - This was a fascinating section where he talks about how numbers and proportions are related to music. Octaves and harmonic notes are all related to simple fractions. And then he says, you look anywhere in the universe, numbers manifest in all kinds of physical processes. For e.g., the ratio of the length of a river to the distance it covers is pi.\nAbsolute Proof - Here, the book compares Mathematical proof and scientific proof. Scientific theories evolve and get better like peeling an onion. But mathematical proofs are infallible and built on a rock-solid foundation that stays strong to eternity. Wow!\nAn infinity of Triples - This gives an account of how Pythagoras dies. In many ways, like romantic heroes of novels, famous Mathematicians seem to die tragic deaths in the hands of jealous adversaries.\nFrom Pythagoras’s Theorem to Fermat’s Last Theorem - Pythagoras equation (x^2 + y^2 = z^2) seems quite innocuous (intuitive even when you consider right-angle triangles). But the moment the powers are changed to cube or higher, you get an equation that is quite complex to prove.\nBooks mentioned\n\nA Mathematician’s Apology - G. H. Hardy\nThe Last Problem - E.T. Bell\nThe City of God - St. Augustine. “God created all things in six days because this number is perfect.”\nIamblichus’ Life of Pythagoras Iamblichus was a fourth-century scholar who wrote nine books about the Pythagorean sect.\n\n\nOther books mentioned in the Appendix\n\nPythagoras – A Short Account of His Life and Philosophy - Leslie Ralph\nPythagoras – A Life - Peter Gorman\nA History of Greek Mathematics, Vols. 1 and 2 - Sir Thomas Heath\nMathematical Magic Show - Martin Gardner\nRiver meandering as a self-organization process - Hans-Henrik Støllum\n\n\n\n2. The Riddler\n\nThis chapter is about Pierre de Fermat, a 17th-century mathematician. He was a civil servant by the day and a Mathematician on the side. Mathematicians were quite secretive during those days with their proofs. Father Mersenne tried to change that and encouraged everyone to exchange ideas. Fermat exchanged ideas with Mersenne but not anyone else till he happened to correspond with Pascal. Fermat and Pascal came up with an entirely new branch of Mathematics - Probability theory! Fermat was also involved in the founding of Calculus.\nA puzzle - Imagine a soccer field with 23 people on it, two teams of 11 players, and the referee. What is the probability that any two of those 23 people share the same birthday? It is a bit over 50%!\nThe Evolution of Number Theory - This section talks about the evolution of Mathematics after Pythagoras’s time. The main person of interest is Euclid. Alexandrian library and the tragic loss of knowledge due to the burning of books are mentioned. Euclid’s Arithmetica survived.\nBirth of a Riddle - Fermat was busy with his judicial duties but used all of his spare time for Mathematics. Claude Bachet (reputedly the most learned man in France) published a Latin translation of Arithmetica, which Fermat happened to read. Fermat wrote logic and comments on the margins of the book.\nThe Marginal Note - In the margin of his Arithmetica (Book 2), next to Problem 8, Fermat wrote an observation about the equation - x^n + y^n = z^n. That there is no number that satisfies this equation and that he had a beautiful proof that the margin could not hold! This statement teased and tormented mathematicians for the next three centuries.\nThe Last Theorem Published at Last - Fermat’s son, Clement-Samuel publishes his father’s work. Leonard Euler, a great mathematician of the time, attempted to give proofs to many of Fermat’s theorems. Euler used the concept of imaginary numbers to prove the theorem for n=3, but could not generalize it.\nBooks mentioned\n\nThe Devil and Simon Flagg by Arthur Porges\nMathematics of Great Amateurs by Julian Coolidge\nThe Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, by Michael Mahoney\nArchimedes’ Revenge, by Paul Hoffman\n\n\n\n3. A Mathematical Disgrace\n\nThe Mathematical Cyclops - This section of the chapter is mostly about Leonard Euler. Was surprised to know that Euler was close friends with the Bernoullis. “Three-body Problem” reminded me of the upcoming Netflix series that the GoT showrunners David Benioff &amp; D.B. Weiss were going to be writing and producing. This section was one of the best. This book is full of geniuses but Euler’s story was truly remarkable. He was completely blind in the last few years of his life but was still working on things.\nA Petty Pace - This section talks about prime numbers and the importance of prime factorization in cryptography.\nMonsieur Le Blanc - This section is about Sophie Germain. Singh talks about various women in the history of Mathematics leading to this point and it was a testament of human triumph in the face of adversities. Interestingly Sophie Germain’s contribution to Mathematics, specifically Fermat’s theorem, may have been attributed to Monsieur Le Blanc (a pseudonym that Sophie used) if Napoleon did not attack Prussia at the time! Sophie wrote a letter to a General friend to guarantee Gauss’s safety.\nThe Sealed Envelopes -  Dirichlet and Legendre independently proved the theorem for n=5, based on Sophie Germain’s work. Lamé proved it for n=7. The French Academy of Sciences offered 3,000 Francs to any mathematician who could solve Fermat’s Last Theorem. Lamé and Cauchy - both great mathematicians of the time, announced that they were on the verge of the proof and submitted sealed envelopes to the academy. Kummer pointed out a fatal flaw regarding using unique factorization.\nBooks mentioned\n\nMen of Mathematics, by E.T. Bell.\nThe periodical cicada problem, by Monte Lloyd and Henry S.

Kummer à M. Liouville by E.E. Kummer.\n\n\n\n4. Into Abstraction\n\nThis section has the story of Paul Wolfskehl, a super rich guy who sets out to commit suicide after a woman rejects him. He is so efficient that he plans everything meticulously, writes his will, letters to family, etc., and even has some spare time before the appointed hour! So lucky for the world!! To keep himself engaged in the spare time, he goes to the library to read something and finds Kummer’s paper. He finds a flaw in the logic and spends the night engrossed in developing a mini-proof, thereby avoiding suicide. Upon his death many years later, he bequeathed a reward of 100,000 Marks (approximately the equivalent of a million dollars by today’s standards) to anyone who could prove Fermat’s last theorem. This prize heralded a new era of interest to solve the theorem and many other mathematical puzzles.\nThe Era of Puzzles, Riddles, and Enigmas - This section goes over the history of puzzles and how they were very popular in the 1800s. Interestingly Lewis Carroll was very interested in puzzles and had set out to write a giant compendium of puzzles. When Wolfskehl prize was announced, there was a lot of frenzy and there was an avalanche of entries sent.\nThe Foundations of Knowledge - This section is about the importance of logic and how Mathematics is strongly built on the foundation of logic. David Hilbert set out to logically rebuild/prove all the mathematical knowledge and make a list of unsolved problems that had to be proved. But Kurt Gödel went on to prove that it was not possible, that from fundamental axioms it is possible to create statements that can never be true or false. “This statement does not have any proof”.\nThe Compulsion of Curiosity - Though Gödel’s theorems of undecidability had put some elements of doubt on whether Fermat’s theorem would ever be proven, it couldn’t dissuade the scores of fanatics.\nThe Brute Force Approach - Invention of computers and the usage of brute force approaches.\nThe Graduate - John Coates, Andrew Wiles’ Ph.D. supervisor encouraged Wiles to study an area of mathematics known as elliptic curves, which proved very useful later on to solve Fermat’s last theorem.\nBooks mentioned\n\n3.1416 and All That, by P.J.

Proof by Contradiction\n\nThis section covers the story of Taniyama and Shimura and their study of modular forms.\nWishful Thinking - Taniyama and Shimura shock the mathematical community by suggesting that elliptic equations and modular forms were effectively one and the same thing.\nDeath of a Genius - Tragic death of Taniyama and later his fiance Misako, through suicide.\nPhilosophy of Goodness - Following Taniyama’s death, Shimura focuses his efforts on understanding the exact relationship between elliptic equations and modular forms. This section gives more details on Taniyama-Shimura conjecture and the importance of bridges that connect separate fields.\nThe Missing Link - Insights from Gerhard Frey &amp; later Ken Ribet, the inference that Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture implied Fermat’s Last Theorem.\nBooks mentioned\n\nYutaka Taniyama and his time, by Goro Shimura.\nLinks between stable elliptic curves and certain diophantine equations, by Gerhard Frey.\n\n\n\n6. The Secret Calculation\n\nThe Attic Recluse - Wiles makes the decision to work in complete isolation and secrecy for many years once he starts working on the proof.\nDueling with Infinity - Wiles had to prove the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture in order to prove Fermat’s last theorem. He employs Mathematical Induction to aid with the proof. This section has the tragic story of Galois.\nToppling the first Domino - Wiles had already spent two years into the proof and using Galois’ Group Theory, he had solved parts of it. He was able to ‘sort’ the infinite number of elliptical equations to groups and prove the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture for the first element of each group.\n“Fermat’s Last Theorem Solved?” - Wiles reads a news article that said the theorem was solved. But thankfully, it turns out to be not the case!\n“The Dark Mansion” - Reminded me of the post made on Amir Aczel’s book 15 years ago!\nThe Method of Kolyvagin and Flach - After a couple of years on Iwasawa theory, Wiles gave up that path and then tried Kolyvagin-Flach method with help from Nick Katz. It was amazing that Katz came on board and grasped 6 years of research in a short time.\nThe Lecture of the Century - Andrew Wiles finally delivered his proof in a series of lectures in 1993. It is one of these lectures that the book starts with.\nThe Aftermath - It became newspaper headlines, including NYT and everyone congratulated Wiles. People magazine even listed him among “the 25 most intriguing people of the year” along with Princess Diana and Oprah Winfrey.\nBooks mentioned\n\nGenius and Biographers: the Fictionalization of Evariste Galois, by T.

A Slight Problem\n\nManuscripts with detailed proof were submitted. Instead of the usual 1-3 referees, 6 were appointed. the 200-page proof was divided into six sections and each of the referees took responsibility for one of these chapters. Nick Katz was one of the referees and he found a flaw.\nThe Carpet Fitter - Initially, Wiles thought it was a minor problem and assured Katz that the solution was right around the corner. But months passed. Word got out and there was a lot of bad publicity. Despite the pressure to release the manuscript publicly, Wiles did not.\nThe Nightmare E-mail - There was an email circulating around that said proof was found in a different way. That turned out to an April fools joke.\nThe Birthday Present - Wiles found a solution just short of his wife’s birthday and handed over the complete manuscript to her as a birthday present.\nBooks mentioned\n\nModular elliptic curves and Fermat’s Last Theorem, by Andrew Wiles.\nRing-theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras, by Richard Taylor and Andrew Wiles.\n\n\n\nEpilogue: Grand Unified Mathematics\n\nOnce again Wiles found himself on the cover of NYT.

And we had never paused to think that, along the way, we were creating the world’s largest attack surface.”\n\n~ Nicole Perlroth - This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends 1\nThoughts\nThe last sentence in the introduction sums up the goal of the book - “My hope is that my work will help shine even a glimmer of light on the highly secretive and largely invisible cyberweapons industry so that we, a society on the cusp of this digital tsunami called the Internet of Things, may have some of the necessary conversations now, before it is too late.”\nThe book does a great job of shining the light on the cyberweapons industry as the unknown shadow adversary. Many of the situations are dramatic and unbelievable that one could think that there is no hope. But the truth is there are many more cyber security professionals now than before and there is better understanding of the threats. Also Presidential Directives like PDD-63 (1998), HSPD-7 (2003), PPD-21 (2013), National Security Order on Cybersecurity (2021) and so forth have put significant federal funds towards bolstering security of Critical Infrastructures.

She goes through a series of dramatic events in the last decade or so that were the result of cyber warfare.\n\nShe talks about the 2017 attack in Ukraine which was timed to happen during the Independence Day. Ukraine was a digital test kitchen for Russian hackers and they had been testing since 2014, when the US was busy with violence in Ferguson, ISIS crisis, North Korean hack of Sony, etc.\nRussian hackers had hit Ukraine in Dec 2015 cutting off power for around 6 hours, and again in Dec 2016.\nChinese hackers at the same time were stealing American IP. Former NSA director Keith Alexander, called Chinese cyberespionage the “greatest transfer of wealth in history.”\nIranian hackers brought down servers at Sands casino in Vegas as a retaliation to Sands owner Sheldon Adelson’s public comment about bombing Iran.\nRussian hackers brought down the entire nation of Estonia offline after Estonians dared to move a Soviet-era statue.\nRussian hackers apparently bombarded the Brexit referendum, hacked the American grid, meddled with the 2016 U.S. elections, and the French elections.\nThe US always thought it was far ahead of other countries in the world when it came to cyber skills but b/w 2016 and 2017, the gap b/w the US and other bad-faith nations closed considerably. One reason could be the “Shadow Brokers” who leaked a lot of cyber tools from NSA. Snowden leaked data, the Shadow Brokers leaked the actual code which was more damning.\nAfter getting hold of NSA’s hacking tools, Russian hackers launched an offensive attack against Ukraine (called “NotPetya”), hitting companies like Maersk, Merck, FedEx, Cadbury, etc. By 2019, the total tally of losses was $10B.\n\nPART I: MISSION IMPOSSIBLE\n\n\n\nCloset of Secrets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fucking Salmon\n\n\n\nPART II: THE CAPITALISTS\n\n\n\nThe Cowboy\n\n\n\n\nThe First Broker\n\n\n\n\nZero-Day Charlie\n\n\n\nPART III: THE SPIES\n\n\n\nProject Gunman\n\n\n\n\nThe Godfather\n\n\n\n\nThe Omnivore\n\n\n\n\nThe Rubicon\n\n\n\n\nThe Factory\n\n\n\nPART IV: THE MERCENARIES\n\n\n\nThe Kurd\n\n\n\n\nDirty Business\n\n\n\n\nGuns for Hire\n\n\n\nPART V: THE RESISTANCE\n\n\n\nAurora\n\n\n\n\nBounty Hunters\n\n\n\n\nGoing Dark\n\n\n\nPART VI: THE TWISTER\n\n\n\nCyber Gauchos\n\n\n\n\nPerfect Storm\n\n\n\n\nThe Grid\n\n\n\nPART VII: BOOMERANG\n\n\n\nThe Russians Are Coming\n\n\n\n\nThe Shadow Brokers\n\n\n\n\nThe Attacks\n\n\n\n\nThe Backyard\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nPerlroth, N. (2021). This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race. United Kingdom: Bloomsbury Publishing. ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2021/2021-05-29---The-Nevers":{"slug":"Blog/2021/2021-05-29---The-Nevers","filePath":"Blog/2021/2021-05-29 - The Nevers.md","title":"Another sci-fi series about a dystopian future","links":["posts/2020-09-26-rbg-death-reflections/"],"tags":["TV-Series","Sci-fi","Futuristic","blog"],"content":"\n“And it turns out that nothing will crack this world harder than one gentle question.”\n~ The Nevers (HBO TV Series) 1\n\nThe ‘The Nevers’ starts with the upper echelons of the society in Victorian England being alarmed by the “natural order” being threatened by people (mostly women) who are “touched” by some mysterious spores from above. The “touched” have special abilities - someone has ability to see glimpses of the future, someone has the skill to see energy flowing across things, someone has power to heal, someone can generate balls of flame, someone can understand any language, one person grows into a giant, on so forth. The premise is exactly like X-Men (No one like Wolverine though!). The show touches upon many social themes like women’s rights, labourers’s rights, etc. though I think the overarching theme is the ‘resistance to change’, especially by people in power.\nBut the last episode (of Part 1 of Season 1) completely changed the narrative. One wondered if one was watching the same series or not since the episode starts off in some distant dystopian future. A lot of mystery is cleared, especially around Amalia, but it also raised so many more questions. One could see that the series could go on in many different directions for a long time and keep the audience intrigued.\nComparison to Raised by Wolves\nIn a way, the dystopian future where earth is destroyed and almost unlivable, reminds one of the future depicted in ‘Raised by Wolves’2.\nShort summary of Episode 6 - “Humanity is a war; earth is almost destroyed; there are two prominent groups - FreeLife and Planetary Defense Coalition (PDC); FreeLife is a group of religious people who believe in God, PDC believes in science; PDC is open to the idea that Galanthi, an alien species could save the earth, while FreeLife wants to kill all the Galanthi and have already killed most of them.”\nRaised by Wolves had The Mithraic (religious group) fight against the Atheists. In both of these stories, I found it intriguing that it is the religious groups that had the technological prowess. The non-religious groups were idealistic but were behind, especially in terms of weapons of mass destruction. This, I think is a diversion from cinema or TV of the past decade where non-religious people were mostly shown as advanced and extremely religious people as primitive.\nI guess many film makers are showing an aspect of the truth of modern times that one could be deeply religious and immersed in rituals and practices that are 1000s of years old and yet be an expert at the cutting edge of modern technology. Also the fact that technological advancements can be leveraged by anyone.\nLofty ideals - faulty implementations\nMost religions have lofty ideals and they provide some tools for effective living - a) rituals, b) connection with people, and c) answers to the big questions about the purpose of life.\nOn the bright side, If you follow rituals they could chart your life into one with positive habit loops where you never go wrong in getting basic things right. If you connect with the right kind of people you stand to lead a more fulfilling life. If you’re able to answer at least some of the fundamental questions of ‘being alive’ in this vast universe of seeming nothingness, you could possibly avoid the crushing void of cynicism and despair.\nBut on the flip side, if you blindly follow rituals and impose them others, if you connect with other people to use religion as a tool of power and manipulation, if you have a flawed worldview that lacks common sense and is harmful to life itself, then you’re yet another person who is pushing humanity to its destruction.\nEleanor Tomlinson as Mary Brighton\nComing back to ‘The Nevers’, though Episode 6 answered many questions, and had a lot of material to think about, an episode that I think back to is Episode 4. It featured a funeral and definitively (sadly) established that Mary was dead. Similar to Professor X in X-Men who could mentally connect with all the mutants in the world, Mary could connect with all the ‘touched’ through her song. So I thought she would play a bigger role. The choice of dresses, the music, etc, had made Mary the singular angelic person in the series at that point in time but her death was quite unexpected. The other thing was that since Eleanor Tomlinson, who was the idealistic and down-to-earth Demelza in Poldark, played the part of Mary, it set the expectations high. In fact, I watched the series only because I saw Tomlinson and Pip Torrens (Tommy Lascelles in ‘The Crown’ and George Warleggan’s uncle in ‘Poldark’) in the trailer.\nThe funeral\nThe song that was sung at the funeral was very touching and to me it underscored the importance of attending a funeral itself. The cinematography and direction were top-notch. The scenes of the funeral and the scenes at the dock with laborers going on a strike around the same time are shown in tandem. A laborer pushing a wheelbarrow is shown and then the scene transitions from the spokes of the worn out wooden wheel barrow to the spokes of an ornate and expensive  wheelchair that Lavinia Bidlow is sitting on at the funeral site. All this is happening while the beautiful hymn in being sung. The hymn and the music makes the scene poignant and an unforgettable experience. The hymn is below. The scene also took me back to my reflections about viewing the departed that I spoke about on the RBG post.\nS1 Episode 4 (The Undertaking) 2:22 - 4:18 - “Now the laborer’s task is o’er”3\n{{&lt; blockquote &gt;}}\nNow the laborer’s task is o’er;\nNow the battle day is past;\nNow upon the farther shore\nLands the voyager at last.\nFather, in thy gracious keeping,\nLeave we now thy servant sleeping.\nThere the tears of earth are dried,\nThere its hidden things are clear,\nThere the work of life is tried\nBy a juster judge than here.\nThere the penitents, that turn\nTo the cross their dying eyes,\nAll the love of Jesus learn\nAt his feet in Paradise.\nFather, in thy gracious keeping,\nLeave we now thy servant sleeping.\n(Not sung in the episode)\n‘Earth to earth, and dust to dust,’\nCalmly now the words we say;\nLeaving him to sleep, in trust,\nTill the resurrection-day.\n{{&lt; /blockquote &gt;}}\n{{&lt; youtube VTCA6Tx_qds &gt;}}\nQuotes\n\nNothing will crack this world harder than one gentle question.\n~ Knitter\n\n\n“This close” is where we always end up.

The real service to the state is to detect it in embryo.”\n~ Foundation by Isaac Asimov 1\n\nThis is the second time I’m reading this book, that too after a gap of around 20 years. I had forgotten so much of the book that it felt like I was reading a new book. Wanted to read the book (or may be even the series) before the TV series started on Apple TV+. The trailer looked super promising and gave a glimpse of the vastness of the Galactic Empire that Asimov had envisioned.\nCollection of Short Stories\nThe book is a collection of 5 short stories - The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders, and The Merchant Princes. At the end of the book, one gets the feeling that you’re just beginning on an epic journey. What we see are small glimpses of what happened. Like an old man telling a story from his youth, or like reading random stories from an epic anthology. Every story starts with a passage from “Encyclopedia Galactica”, a hypothetical compendium of knowledge. The first story sets the backdrop of the beginning of the Foundation (or foundations). The second takes place 50 years after the first, the third is 30 years after that, the fourth (The Traders) is 55 years after that and so on.\nThe vast world\nWhat is surprising is that the book was published in 1951, 70 years prior to now! In fact, the individual stories in the book were published in the preceding decade. The immense world-building and the numbers are so mind-boggling that it is not easy for one to wrap one’s mind around it. The Galactic Empire has reigned for 12,000 years. Humans have populated millions of planets. The total population of humanity is in quintillions. Trantor the planet which is the capital of the Galactic Empire, has a population of 40 billion. In 1951 40B might have been such a huge number for a planet since the population of Earth back then, was around 2.5B. Now earth has over 8B people and 40B is only 5 times as big. If we have mile-long cities below the surface, it would not be that crowded as we think it would be. Though Factfulness does mention that the population most probably will plateau once it reaches around 11-12B. We’ll have to see what the future holds. My hope is that the population keeps increasing and that humans will be able to inhabit other planets. It is more optimistic to visualize a 12,000 year Galactic Era in the future than a desolate earth destroyed by human fighting. Also, ten thousand years into the future, one could hope that human lifespan could be much more than the mere hundred years of the present.\nThe Beginning\nHari Seldon, a psychohistorian, is in Trantor at the beginning of the novel (the first short story). Hari is predicting that the empire will fall in the next 300 years to enter into a dark age for 30,000 years. Hari has a plan to reduce the time to just 1000 years. He is captured for espousing traitorous ideas of the fall of the Empire and brought to trial. During his trial, he maintains that the fall of the Empire is inevitable and says that it is necessary for a group of people to be assembled to consolidate all the knowledge into an encyclopedia, creating what he calls as ‘The Foundation’. As a punishment, the committee exiles him to a planet named Terminus in the corner of the galaxy. It is later revealed that Terminus is the exact planet that Hari wanted to create the Foundation in. We also get to know that there is another foundation being created at the other end of the galaxy.\nHari is able to predict what happens in the future based on his calculations. Long after Hari is dead and gone, a recorded voice of his plays exactly 50 years after Foundation is established. The book mentions a few times that the laws of statistics applied to large groups of people could predict the general outcome of future events. One of the characters asks whether it could predict a single person’s life to which the answer is that No, one cannot foresee a single person’s future using psychohistory. The inspiration probably came from Bernoulli’s Theorem (the law of large numbers) which says that outcome of an experiment will converge to the expected value when it is performed a large number of times (or using a large sample). So if a coin is flipped multiple times, the result will converge to 1/2 as the number of tries approaches infinity.\nReflections\nIn the third chapter, it was interesting to see The Foundation exercising control over the four planets (four kingdoms) nearby through religion (named Scientism). The Foundation itself is set up on Terminus, a planet with scarce resources but it has scholars and superior technology. The Foundation shares its technology with the four Kingdoms by referring to it as “holy” artifacts and rules. Scientism has priests who are trained on Terminus but they are unaware of the true nature of the technology that they are using. I was reminded of an article that I’d read in the past where someone had listed many of the superstitions followed in India and the scientific basis behind them. Peepal trees being associated with ghosts and sleeping under them is not good, one must take bath after attending a funeral, don’t cut nails after sunset, etc.\nIn the last story, Hober Mallow, a master trader, realizes the limitation of religion to conquer more territories (planets/kingdoms). The way to expand more is through trade. So when the Republic of Korell declares war on The Foundation, Mallow takes no action but imposes a ‘sanction’ on Korell stopping trade. This forces Korell to surrender without The Foundation having to go on a war. That is so similar to the way some countries today maintain control over other aggressive nations!\nWinning things through diplomacy and scientific knowledge is a huge theme throughout the book. In fact, the statement “Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.” is repeated often, especially in the last story.\nQuotes\n\n“It is the chief characteristic of the religion of science that it works.”\n\n\n“Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.”\n\n\n“Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.”\n\n\n“Past glories are poor feeding.”\n\n\nIt’s a worship of the past. It’s a deterioration—a stagnation!\n\n\n“Encyclopedias don’t win wars.”\n\n\n“The rotten tree-trunk, until the very moment when the storm-blast breaks it in two, has all the appearance of might it ever had.”\n\n\n“Religion is the most potent device known with which to control men and worlds.”\n\n\n“Ambitious men will not wait and unscrupulous men will not hang back. By their every action they will hasten the decay of the worlds.”\n\n\n“Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty.”\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nFoundation (Apple Series Tie-in Edition) by Isaac Asimov ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2021/2021-07-10---When-Breath-Becomes-Air":{"slug":"Blog/2021/2021-07-10---When-Breath-Becomes-Air","filePath":"Blog/2021/2021-07-10 - When Breath Becomes Air.md","title":"When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi","links":["Abraham-Verghese"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Biography","Philosophy","book-notes","blog"],"content":"\n“I would have to learn to live in a different way, seeing death as an imposing itinerant visitor but knowing that even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.”\n~ Paul Kalanithi, When Breath Becomes Air 1\n\nI first read about this book through Gates Notes2, where Bill Gates mentions that the book left him in tears. It has been on my reading list for some time. Glad to have read it this year. It is far from being just a sad story about a person dying. It touches many aspects of human life, as though Paul lived many lives in a short span of 37 years. As a son of parents from different religions, son of immigrants, as someone who experienced competitive city life and outdated education in the suburbs, as someone who lived closely with nature, as an explorer, as a wanderer studying different subjects and earning degrees in literature and medicine, as a neurosurgeon, as a husband, as a father, as a son, as a brother.. he indeed lived a fascinating life. The book is a gift to the world. It was truly altruistic of him to write during his last few months as he was going through extreme physical pain due to Chemotherapy and other treatments for his cancer.\nI was taken aback by the foreword itself. The foreword, written by Abraham Verghese, another man of medicine who is also a writer, was quite touching and memorable. I read it more than twice. He underscores the point that you often get to know a person intimately after the person has passed on. He knew Paul at Stanford and had read a couple of his essays, but he really started getting to know him during his funeral through the stories that people recounted and afterward.\nPart 1 of the book is set in the past - recounting his life from childhood to becoming a neurosurgeon at Stanford. His father was a doctor. He credits his mother for instilling a love of literature in him. Though they moved from New York to Arizona, his mother didn’t want them to be behind in studies. So she made sure her kids read books from the AP list and were on par with students from the best schools in the US, in preparation for SAT and college. I got intrigued to find out what this list was. Googled for it and found that the recommendations are varied. Goodreads has 205 books as recommendations3, The Ultimate AP English Literature Reading List from Albert.io has 404, another list had the top 225, etc. But all these books are quite famous, and I haven’t read all of them. Just imagining someone reading all these books in their teenage years was mind-boggling.\nIt was also good to read about intense schedules, being completely immersed in work, being on call for emergencies, having no time for anything else, and yet finding fulfillment in the work since he viewed it as a calling. It is something that I could relate to. Paul says that most people find jobs that fit their lifestyle.\n\n“Indeed, this is how 99 percent of people select their jobs: pay, work environment, hours. But that’s the point. Putting lifestyle first is how you find a job - not a calling.”\n\nIn Part 2, Paul returns to the day he is diagnosed with cancer. Then it is a detailed account of what he goes through. At one point, it seemed like he would overcome it, but then cancer wins. In between all this, he goes through tough decisions in life - whether to take a job offer in a different state, whether to have a child, etc. The most challenging part of life is being in a state of uncertainty where you’re not able to decide on basic things that are probably much easier for most of the others. NYT book review6 captures this really well -\n\n“..Dr. Kalanithi tries to reinvent himself in various ways with no idea what will happen. He can’t gauge how much strength his body still has until he tests it, and sometimes the consequences are horrific. He no longer knows who he is or what he wants. His whole sense of identity is shaken.”\n\nOverall, it is a great book to reflect upon one’s life. Nuggets of wisdom are peppered throughout the book and there are some great quotes that would make you stop and think. By talking about death, the book talks volumes about life and relationships. Here are some quotes to reflect upon -\n\n“Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.”\n\n\n“There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.”\n\n\n“You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.”\n\n\n“Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.”\n\n\n“The tricky part of illness is that, as you go through it, your values are constantly changing. You try to figure out what matters to you, and then you keep figuring it out.”\n\n\n“Most lives are lived with passivity toward death — it’s something that happens to you and those around you.”\n\n\n“Literature not only illuminated another’s experience, it provided, I believed, the richest material for moral reflection.”\n\n\n“If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?”\n\n\n“Those burdens are what make medicine holy and wholly impossible: in taking up another’s cross, one must sometimes get crushed by the weight.”\n\n\n“While all doctors treat diseases, neurosurgeons work in the crucible of identity: every operation on the brain is, by necessity, a manipulation of the substance of our selves.”\n\n\n“All have a notion of what it means to be good, and we can’t live up to it all the time.”\n\n\n“Moral duty has weight, things that have weight have gravity.”\n\n\n“Suffering can make us callous to the obvious suffering of another.”\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nKalanithi, P. (2017). When Breath Becomes Air. United States: Random House. ↩\n\n\nwww.gatesnotes.com/books/When-Breath-Becomes-Air ↩\n\n\nGoodreads - Books for AP English Literature and Composition courses ↩\n\n\nThe Ultimate AP English Literature Reading List from Albert.io ↩\n\n\nREAD, READ, READ to Prepare for AP Lit Exam ↩\n\n\nNYT Review ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2021/2021-07-24---Metamorphosis":{"slug":"Blog/2021/2021-07-24---Metamorphosis","filePath":"Blog/2021/2021-07-24 - Metamorphosis.md","title":"Metamorphosis By Franz Kafka","links":[],"tags":["Fiction","Psychology","Classics","book-notes","blog"],"content":"\nPeople did not understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than previously ..”\n~ The Metamorphosis from Franz Kafka1\n\nMetamorphosis is a short novel that you can finish reading in a few hours. But those few hours can truly set you thinking for several days. The book starts off like a comedy and you keep expecting the protagonist to wake up from his dream or for him to transform but you reach the end of the story and it is quite difficult to come to terms with the tragedy of it all.\nThe Story\nGregor Samsa is a traveling salesman with a hectic schedule and is the sole earner for his family. He doesn’t like his job nor his micromanaging boss but he cannot quit since he needs to take care of his family. He is an exemplary worker who has not called in sick in his five years of service and yet he is afraid of being fired on the spot by his boss.\nHe wakes up one day and finds that he has changed into a giant bug (or cockroach). His biggest concern is that he will not be able to catch the train and go to work and that his boss will misunderstand that he is slacking.  And that turns out to be the case. When Gregor is delayed, the Head Clerk comes to his home and asks him to come out assuming that he is hiding in his room after having done something wrong.\nWith great difficulty he manages to roll over and get out of bed and open the door. Everyone is shocked, the Head Clerk runs away. From that day onwards everything goes awry. His family slips into poverty, his father starts working as an assistant, his sister starts working as a salesgirl, they get some boarders home for rent, etc. Though initially sympathetic to his plight, gradually it gets to a state where they blame him for all their misfortunes. They think that they will be ruined unless he is dead. In the end, Gregor dies heartbroken and the family is relieved.\nReflection\nI was reminded of the story of the leper2 in the Bible. Over the years, I’ve heard a lot of sermons on this story which is usually given on the second Sunday of the lent. The story is the same but the interpretation and the message is always different. But it could also be that the same message is perceived and understood differently.\nLeprosy or any kind of skin disease was deemed to be a curse. After contracting leprosy, some people would go away from their families and stay with other lepers outside the city gates. Some people would be driven out by their family. In some cases, family would take care of the lepers but the society would ostracize the family and sometimes force them to send the leper way. Regardless of the way people treated them when the disease started, they almost always ended up being alienated and outsiders to the society.\nThe fear of alienation and the pressure of the society is real. Many times, people give more than what is needed for a job, sacrifice their sense of self for a relationship or to be part of a group - just not to be alienated. Then they lose their ‘self’ completely and become a bug only to get into the situation that they feared the most - being alienated. I guess the key is to ‘give it all’ and “do more” only for something that is “your true calling” and not when you don’t like it every day. But the unfortunate thing is also that most of the people in the world do not have that choice. The technological advances of the 21st century have not solved world hunger and disease yet. Improving the quality of life seems quite far off.\nAnother thing was family’s view of life when misfortune hits them. When you have a misfortune and you compare yourself against others, you begin to believe that only you are riddled with problems and everyone else has an easy life.\n\n“The main thing holding the family back from a change in living quarters was far more their complete hopelessness and the idea that they had been struck by a misfortune like no one else in their entire circle of relatives and acquaintances.”\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe Metamorphosis (AmazonClassics Edition) free for Prime members. ↩\n\n\nStory of the Leper - Matthew 8:1-4, Mark 1:40–45 and Luke 5:12–16 ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2021/2021-08-07---Beyond-Order":{"slug":"Blog/2021/2021-08-07---Beyond-Order","filePath":"Blog/2021/2021-08-07 - Beyond Order.md","title":"Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life by  Jordan B.

Mathematicians have been responsible for developing the codes that are currently used to protect military information.\n~ Simon Singh, The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography\n\nThoughts\nOver the years he (Babbage) accumulated a thick file of encrypted messages, which he planned to use as the basis for an authoritative book on cryptanalysis, entitled “The Philosophy of Decyphering”. The book would contain two examples of every kind of cipher, one that would be broken as a demonstration and one that would be left as an exercise for the reader.\nWhen I was reading through the above passage, it occurred to me that this is what Simon Singh was doing - Creating a book about deciphering! Full credit to him for weaving interesting tidbits from history and making the book an engaging whodonit story.\nThe best parts are the way the ciphers are broken down and explained that any one could easily understand. Even without the explanations of deciphering specific ciphertext (if you want to skip over that), just the history is fascinating.\nI was surprised (or may be not) that the book started with the story of Mary, the Queen of Scots. I feel that retelling of the stories of Mary, the Queen of Scots, Willam Wallace (Braveheart), Jacobite revolution (Outlander) and other martyrs in the last couple of decades through movies, TV series and books, have made the public feel a kind of kinship with Scotland. There is a kind of romantic allure to Scotland. What better way to hook a reader to a book than start with a story connected to Scotland!\nAnother great thing is, he makes it all so simple and easy to understand something that was otherwise out of the reach for most. He does mention that in the modern age, it is more relevant to everyday life than in the past. Here is a quote from the book -\n\n“Cryptography used to be an obscure science, of little relevance to everyday life. Historically, it always had a special role in military and diplomatic communications. But in the Information Age, cryptography is about political power, and in particular, about the power relationship between a government and its people. It is about the right to privacy, freedom of speech, freedom of political association, freedom of the press, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, freedom to be left alone.”\n\nNotes\nIntroduction\n1 The Cipher of Mary Queen of Scots\nMary the Queen of Scots’s life is on the line. people in the court of Queen Elizabeth are trying to prove that Mary committed treason.

Corey, etc.\nDune is powerful because it is a lot of things - a coming-of-age story, a story of revenge and family honor, a story of living in a close relationship with nature, a story of heroism, a story of optimism, a love story, a story set in the future (10 thousand years!), a story of prescience and fortune telling, a story of women’s power, a story of politics and strategy, and so forth. It didn’t live up to the hype when I first read it. But it grows into you the more you think and makes you want to read it again.\nQuotes\n\n“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”\n"},"Blog/2021/2021-11-30---Bradbury---Zen-in-the-Art-of-Writing":{"slug":"Blog/2021/2021-11-30---Bradbury---Zen-in-the-Art-of-Writing","filePath":"Blog/2021/2021-11-30 - Bradbury - Zen in the Art of Writing.md","title":"Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Self-Help","Writing","book-notes"],"content":"\n“You have your list of favorite writers; I have mine.

It keeps you aware of your nose, your eye, your ear, your tongue, your hand. And, above all, poetry is compacted metaphor or simile. Such metaphors, like Japanese paper flowers, may expand outward into gigantic shapes. Ideas lie everywhere through the poetry books, yet how rarely have I heard short story teachers recommending them for browsing. What poetry? Any poetry that makes your hair stand up along your arms. Don’t force yourself too hard. Take it easy. Over the years you may catch up to, move even with, and pass T. S. Eliot on your way to other pastures. You say you don’t understand Dylan Thomas? Yes, but your ganglion does, and your secret wits, and all your unborn children. Read him, as you can read a horse with your eyes, set free and charging over an endless green meadow on a windy day.”\n\n\n“We must take arms each and every day, perhaps knowing that the battle cannot be entirely won, but fight we must, if only a gentle bout. The smallest effort to win means, at the end of each day, a sort of victory.

I’m glad that I finally got a chance to read the book. Of course, almost everyone instinctively knows about the importance of sleep. Most people might have had a first hand experience of the ill effects of lack of sleep after going through a sleepless night and struggling through the next day.\nThis book presents information in such a way that would make one sit and think. One gets to understand that sleep is just not ‘rest’, it is beyond what most people think it is. It defines our personality and is critical for our cognitive ability and creativity. A case could be made that humans have evolved to be the most intelligent species on earth because we make the most use out of our sleep. In comparison to most other animals we sleep less but have more percentage of REM sleep which gives us a huge advantage.\nIf our closest cousins, the orangutans, need to sleep for almost double the time (around 16 hours), in the the last 350,000 yrs, we have evolved to sleep less - a mere 8 hours. May be this is a trend and in another 100,000 years, humans might sleep much lesser and yet be more effective. Once we figure out the exact semantics of what sleep entails, we probably could speeden it up. During the course of history, we have made many natural processes of the body faster. For e.g., take the case of healing of a wound. Body can take care of it and heal slowly but with medication, it is faster. There are so many different aspects of our body that has become much better due to modern science.\nEven if you don’t get a chance to read the entire book, just the first chapter can give you insights about sleep that you can take with you for a lifetime. Alternatively, you could also watch/listen to Walker’s talks on Youtube 2.\nBook Notes\n- Part 1 -  This Thing Called Sleep\nChapter 1 - To sleep …\nChapter 2 - Caffeine, Jet lag, and Melatonin: Losing and Gaining Control of Your Sleep Rhythm\nChapter 3 - Defining and Generating Sleep: Time Dilation and What We Learned from a Baby in 1952\nChapter 4 - Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain: Who sleeps, How Do We Sleep, and How Much?\nChapter 5 - Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span\n- Part 2 - Why Should You Sleep?\nChapter 6 - Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew: The Benefits of Sleep for the Brain\nChapter 7 - Too Extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records: Sleep Deprivation and the Brain\nChapter 8 - Cancer, Heart Attacks, and a Shorter Life: Sleep Deprivation and the Body\n- Part 3 - How and Why We Dream\nChapter 9 Routinely Psychotic: REM-Sleep Dreaming\nChapter 10 Dreaming as Overnight Therapy\nChapter 11 Dream Creativity and Dream Control\n- Part 4 - From Sleeping Pills to Society Transformed\nChapter 12 Things That Go Bump in the Night: Sleep Disorders and Death Caused by No Sleep\nChapter 13 iPads, Factory Whistles, and Nightcaps: What’s Stopping You from Sleeping?\nChapter 14 Hurting and Helping Your Sleep: Pills vs. Therapy\nChapter 15 Sleep and Society: What Medicine and Education Are Doing Wrong; What Google and NASA Are Doing Right\nChapter 16 A New Vision for Sleep in the Twenty-First Century\nConclusion: To Sleep or Not to Sleep\nAppendix: Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\n\nwww.gatesnotes.com/Books/Why-We-Sleep ↩\n\n\nTalks at Google - www.youtube.com/watch ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2022/2022-03-20---Navigating-the-Cybersecurity-Career-Path":{"slug":"Blog/2022/2022-03-20---Navigating-the-Cybersecurity-Career-Path","filePath":"Blog/2022/2022-03-20 - Navigating the Cybersecurity Career Path.md","title":"Navigating the Cybersecurity Career Path by Helen Patton","links":["Blog/2021/2021-05-15---This-Is-How-They-Tell-Me-the-World-Ends"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Information-Technology","Cybersecurity","Career-Development","book-notes","blog"],"content":"I follow Helen Patton on LinkedIn.

At that point, I’d read 2 of the 3 books - Effective Executive by Drucker and Goldratt - The Goal by Goldratt. The one that was left to read was “The Innovator’s Dilemma”. It is a phenomenal book to read. Great quotes, examples and life lessons to learn from. In some ways, it goes against some of the principles in Good to Great. It says that good management was the most powerful reason many big companies failed to stay atop their industries.\n“If good management practice drives the failure of successful firms faced with disruptive technological change, then the usual answers to companies, problems — planning better, working harder, becoming more customer-driven, and taking a longer-term perspective — all exacerbate the problem. Sound execution, speed-to-market, total quality management, and process reengineering are similarly ineffective.”\nIn spirit, it is similar to Gladwell’s David vs Goliath. David is nimble, and has lot more freedom for manouverability but Goliath is huge, has a heavy armor and is limited in mobility and what he can use.\nNotes\nIntroduction\nquotes\n\n“An organization’s capabilities reside in two places. The first is in its processes — the methods by which people have learned to transform inputs of labor, energy, materials, information, cash, and technology into outputs of higher value.

Wow!\nWordle1 the game, is simple, yet super fulfilling once you crack the word of the day. As per wikipedia2, the emoji-style display of the result that could be shared with friends is what made this game a viral phenomenon on social media (Twitter especially). People could share that they solved the day’s puzzle without revealing the letters.\nStrategies\nIn the beginning, I used random words that came to mind, then started using words that had more vowels like ADIEU and AUDIO. For a while, I always started with the previous day’s word. Sometimes, I wondered what the previous day’s word was. Yeah, there are days in which much seemed to have happened between two mornings.\nAs per Tyler Glaiel 3, the mathematically optimal first guess is “ROATE”. Could also be ORATE I guess. Popular first words are ADIEU, AUDIO, STARE, CRATE, TEARY, PIOUS, RAISE, etc. Some sites mention that if you cover the letters RSTLNE in the first two guesses, you could mostly solve the puzzle on the 3rd try. Chris Chow 4 analyzed a few of the “seed word” strategies and explains why we ought to take “best” Wordle seed words with a pinch of salt. The key to the game is not the seed word necessarily but the strategy that one should follow based on the response to the first word. Interview Kickstart has an article with a list of algorithms to solve wordle 5. I’m wondering if ‘design wordle’ could be an interview question if one were to build a server side solution. The game itself is a javascript client side solution 6.\nEnd Note\nAfter playing the game for many days, I realized that it is fun to start with a word that comes to mind at that time. After solving, take a screenshot and save it into photos. After a month, when you look back at all the screenshots and look at the first words, you kind of get a glimpse of what you were thinking that morning. Or it can make you wonder too.\nBefore playing the game, I didn’t quite realize that there were so many 5 letter words in English. There are 2315 possible solutions in the game. In addition to the feeling of elation after solving it, the game also helped connect me with a few friends that I had lost touch with. Also, my wife and I solve it separately and it reminds me of the initial days of our marriage when we used to play Scrabble often. Go Wordle!

Or perhaps more aptly put, each of us may hold a piece to a puzzle no one else has been able to solve since humankind first landed on Hyperion.”\n~ Sol Weintraub in Hyperion1\n\nShort Summary\nHyperion, the novel, starts in the future (2900 AD) at a time when humans have become inter-planetary species, and the worlds are connected via the WorldWeb. People are able to not only talk but also travel across planets almost instantaneously. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly developed and has its own civilization named the “AllThing,” and they assist humans. The worlds are governed by the “Hegemony of Man”, a coalition of representatives from humans (Senate) and AllThing. In addition to this, there is a group of humans called Ousters who broke away from the rest of humanity since they disapproved of the dependence on AI.\nThe novel’s setting is a war between the Outsters and the Hegemony to gain control of a planet named Hyperion. What makes Hyperion unique is that it contains structures that move back in time called the “Time Tombs”. They are guarded by a mysterious four-armed creature named “The Shrike”, with a body full of curved steel blades. The creature is a legend since most people have no idea how it looks or if it even exists. People take a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs and The Shrike temple, never to return.\nFor the first time, the Time Tombs are opening, and there may never be a pilgrimage again. Seven people are selected to take the final pilgrimage to the Time Tombs, and what they find might decide the fate of the galaxy. They don’t know each other, nor how they were chosen, but they have some connection with the Shrike.\nEach of the seven pilgrims tells their stories to understand what connects them and how their past is helpful to the future of humanity. The book ends with stories from all of them except one (since that person goes missing), and they embark on their journey into the valley of the time tombs. So the end is actually the beginning! I liked the ending.\nIt kind of reminded me of “Raised by Wolves”2 Season 1, where a flying snake is born at the end of the season, and that sets the stage for the real beginning. Or even in “Game of Thrones”3 Season 1, after an entire season of eventful happenings, at the very end, the dragons are born, signaling that the story is just about to start.\nOf course, I read part 2 of the book - “The Fall of Hyperion”4 to get to know what happens to the pilgrims.\nin medias res5\nI love stories that start in the midst of things, and the past is revealed slowly as the story progresses. If you think of it, once you’re an adult, most people you meet always have some fascinating history that you get to know slowly as you get to know them in the present.\nThinking of flashbacks, the first thing that comes to mind is “The Arrow”6 TV series. I saw the first couple of seasons of the show a few years ago, and the way the show presented the two parallel timelines was incredible. It was like watching two movies in parallel.\nIn fact, there are many stories that start in the middle, and that’s what makes them intriguing. There are so many, but a few come to mind right now. ‘The Odyssey’7 doesn’t immediately begin after the Trojan War but many years later. We get to know of the events prior to the start of the book (Ulysses being held captive by the goddess Calypso) at a later point. ‘Paradise Lost’8 begins after Satan, and his followers are defeated. The backstory of the reason and the war are told as the story progresses. Coming back to TV series’, GOT3 is a good example. It starts 15 years after the rebellion, which dethroned the Targaryens, who had ruled Westeros for 300 years. As the series progresses, we get to know a lot of the backstory and mythology about Westeros. ‘The Blacklist’9 is an example of a story where the backstory has so many twists and turns!\nList of stories\nAs I mentioned earlier, the book is effectively a collection of short stories by the pilgrims - Catholic priest Father Lenar Hoyt, Colonel Fedmahn Kassad, poet Martin Silenus, scholar Sol Weintraub, detective Brawne Lamia and the Hegemony Consul. The Templar Het Masteen does not tell his story since he goes missing. Father Hoyt starts with another priest’s (Paul Duré) account. So in a way, Father Hoyt says two stories - his and Duré’s. So there are actually seven stories. If you strictly count the number of pilgrims, it is not seven but eight. Sol has a baby with him.\n\nThe Priest’s Tale: “The Man Who Cried God” - Told during dinnertime when the pilgrims are on the treeship Yggdrasil on their way to Hyperion.\nThe Soldier’s Tale: “The War Lovers” - Told after they land on Keats and start their journey upriver on a ship named Benares.\nThe Poet’s Tale: “Hyperion Cantos” - Told on the ship during dinner time while traveling further north to the Shrike temple.\nThe Scholar’s Tale: “The River Lethe’s Taste is Bitter” - Told on the windwagon that would take them across the sea of grass.\nThe Detective’s Tale: “The Long Good-Bye” - Told on the tramcar between the mountains.\nThe Consul’s Tale: “Remembering Siri” - Told after they reach Chronos Keep.\n\nThe first story gives you a jolt and makes you think, especially about resurrection. Sol’s story is sad and helps explain the presence of the baby. Brawne’s story reminded me of Snowcrash10. The story that I liked best was Martin the poet’s tale. There were so many quotable passages that I re-read a few of them.\nThough the genre is sci-fi and the backdrop is war, the presence of John Keats11 looms large. There are references to Keats everywhere. The capital city of Hyperion is named Keats. Several of the poems get mentioned throughout the story. Searched for Keat’s poems and found the list of 10 Greatest Poems by John Keats by Annabelle Fuller quite good. In the comments section someone mentioned an article about Keats’ Great Odes and the Sublime and that set me thinking about the Sublime in Westworld.\nIn Westworld12, The Sublime, is a virtual world, a heaven, for the hosts. They can upload their consciousness into the Sublime and leave their robot bodies behind. Watching the hosts gleefully jump into the sublime through the door in the ‘Valley Beyond’ was one of the iconic scenes in Westworld.\nBack to Silenus, here are a few quotes from his tale.\nQuotes from the poet’s tale\n“There arises from a bad and unapt formation of words a wonderful obstruction to the mind.”\n“My early poetry was execrable. As with most bad poets, I was unaware of this fact, secure in my arrogance that the very act of creating gave some worth to the worthless abortions I was spawning.”\n“Belief in one’s identity as a poet or writer prior to the acid test of publication is as naive and harmless as the youthful belief in one’s immortality … and the inevitable disillusionment is just as painful.”\n“The life of a poet lies not merely in the finite language-dance of expression but in the nearly infinite combinations of perception and memory combined with the sensitivity to what is perceived and remembered.”\n“Reworked experience is the stuff of all true poetry and raw experience was the birthing gift of my new life.”\n“Besides, history viewed from the inside is always a dark, digestive mess, far different from the easily recognizable cow viewed from afar by historians.”\n“Prison always has been a good place for writers, killing, as it does, the twin demons of mobility and diversion.”\n“As long as the task is both onerous and repetitive, I discovered, the mind is not only free to wander to more imaginative climes, it actually flees to higher planes.”\n“Words bend our thinking to infinite paths of self-delusion, and the fact that we spend most of our mental lives in brain mansions built of words means that we lack the objectivity necessary to see the terrible distortion of reality which language brings.”\n“Language serves not only to express thought but to make possible thoughts which could not exist without it.”\n“Poets are the mad midwives to reality. They see not what is, nor what can be, but what must become.”\n“Words are the only bullets in truth’s bandolier. And poets are the snipers.”\n“Poetry is only secondarily about words. Primarily, it is about truth.”\n“The difference between finding the right word as opposed to accepting the almost right word was the difference between being struck by lightning and merely watching a lightning display.”\n“Sometimes took an hour or a day for a word to come to me, for a concept to sink its roots into the firm soil of language.”\n“For those who do not write and who never have been stirred by the creative urge, talk of muses seems a figure of speech, a quaint conceit, but for those of us who live by the Word, our muses are as real and necessary as the soft clay of language which they help to sculpt. When one is writing—really writing—it is as if one is given a fatline to the gods. No true poet has been able to explain the exhilaration one feels when the mind becomes an instrument as surely as does the pen or thought processor, ordering and expressing the revelations flowing in from somewhere else.”\nFootnotes\n\n\nSimmons, D. (1990). Hyperion. New York: Bantam Books. www.google.com/books/edition/Hyperion/u4R_FstZDEgC ↩\n\n\nRaised by Wolves, Season 1, Ep 10: The Beginning. raised-by-wolves.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beginning ↩\n\n\nGame of Thrones, Season 1, Ep 10: Fire and Blood. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_Blood_(Game_of_Thrones) ↩ ↩2\n\n\nSimmons, D. (1995). The Fall of Hyperion. New York: Bantam. www.google.com/books/edition/_/e-ZOSWjeWroC ↩\n\n\nwww.britannica.com/art/in-medias-res-literature ↩\n\n\nArrow - Season 1. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(season_1) ↩\n\n\nThe Odyssey (Emily Wilson Edition). (2018). United Kingdom: W.W.

There’s only a certain number of computers attached, yet you never quite reach the edge of the network. There’s always another computer down the line. Eventually, you’ll make a complete circuit and wind up back where you started. Most networks are so complicated and interwoven that no one knows where all their connections lead.”\n~ The Cuckoo’s Egg1\n\nThoughts\nWhat’s the book about?\nIt is a first-person account of a sysadmin (who was an astronomer) at Berkeley tasked with a seemingly innocuous task of tracking down a 75 cent accounting discrepancy of server usage and discovering a secret web of computer network hacking and stealing of classified information. A year-long hunt for the hacker connects Cliff to many government departments and cable network operators across the US and finally finds that the hacking originated from abroad.\nIt is a fascinating book. I had heard a lot about this book and always wanted to read it. It is an engaging book even if you’re not into cybersecurity, though in today’s world, everyone is unwittingly into cybersecurity and should be aware of the security of one’s own data and privacy.\nHowever, it is not just a story about chasing a hacker but a glimpse of society and people interactions. It is a history lesson on how things were networked in the 80s; it’s about life in Berkeley as an astronomer; about how being too passionate about work can affect one’s love life; about persistence, about taking notes, about how frustrating it can be to work with bureaucrats; how to improvise when you don’t have resources; and so on.\nMy key takeaway\nMy big takeaway was that you have to take notes. Being able to journal events of the day and being able to retrieve crucial pieces of information when you need it, is critical to your learning process. Our brain works that way. There are many PKMs2 that allow you to organize notes like a “Second Brain”, a concept popularized by Tiago Forte3.\nThere are a few instances where Cliff talks explicitly about the importance of taking notes. In the first few * Chapters, he mentions -\n\n“The astronomer’s rule of thumb: if you don’t write it down, it didn’t happen.”\n\nThere is also an incident later where someone in the NSA had leaked information about the investigation to DoE. His manager says that not informing DoE was a mistake since their lab got funding from DoE. Cliff points to his notes and says that DoE was informed two months ago and it was documented in the logbook. Here is the quote from the book after this -\n\n“Saved by my logbook. Just like observing at a telescope. If you don’t document it, you might as well not have observed it. Sure, you need powerful telescopes and computers. But without a logbook, your observations won’t amount to much.”\n\nNotes\nHighlights from my kindle\n\nChapter 3\n\nPage 22 · Location 390\nCollect raw data and throw away the expected .

But funds run out and instead of letting him off he is transferred to the computer center. He is grateful that he has a job instead of having to stand on the unemployment line.\nHis neighbors - Wayne an expert who complains and Dave, a Unix Buddha. They manage the computers used by the lab employees.\nOn the second day, Dave hands Cliff a problem of a 75 cent shortfall in the last month’s bill or server usage.\nAfter trying several programs and trial and error, Cliff finds that a user named Hunter had used a server for some time. It was not accounted for since Hunter was not added to the system. He thought the problem is solved.\nNext day they received an email from a computer named Dockmaster saying that their computer was broken into. While investigating this Cliff finds that a user named Sventek had logged in.\nBut Dave says it could not have been Joe Sventek since he had left for England last year.\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nA week later Sventek logs in again.\nCliff talks about account types, privileges, people hacking for fun, etc. Could the movie Wargames actually happen? (Reminds me.. I’ve got to watch this! I’ve come across mentions of the movie earlier too.)\nCliff wonders if the user who is accessing the labs computers could be a super-user hacker.\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nInteresting tidbit - Lawrence Berkeley lab and Lawrence Livermore lab - both were named after California’s first Nobel Laureate.\nCliff and Dave go to Rory who is their division head and talk about the hacker. He asks them to find proof.\nCliff writes a program to beep his terminal whenever someone connected to the Unix computer and finds out which port the hacker connector from - tt23. “tt” - dial-in telephones.\nHe decides to printout commands issued by the hacker when they log in. Borrows around 50 printers and portable devices from others. Next morning, finds eighty feet of printout!\n\n\nChapter 4\nChapter 5\nChapter 6\nChapter 7\nChapter 8\nChapter 9\nChapter 10\nChapter 11\nChapter 12\nChapter 13\nChapter 14\nChapter 15\nChapter 16\nChapter 17\nChapter 18\nChapter 19\nChapter 20\nChapter 21\nChapter 22\nChapter 23\nChapter 24\nChapter 25\nChapter 26\nChapter 27\nChapter 28\nChapter 29\nChapter 30\nChapter 31\nChapter 32\nChapter 33\nChapter 34\nChapter 35\nChapter 36\nChapter 37\nChapter 38\nChapter 39\nChapter 40\nChapter 41\nChapter 42\nChapter 43\nChapter 44\nChapter 45\nChapter 46\nChapter 47\nChapter 48\nChapter 49\nChapter 50\nChapter 51\nChapter 52\nChapter 53\nChapter 54\nChapter 55\nChapter 56\nEpilogue\n\nFollow up\nI stumbled upon this lecture series by Chris Sanders2 who uses the book to give an introduction to Information Security.

The seller was a doctor who had purchased the books from a library sale many years ago and had even read some of the classics in Latin when he was younger. I feel super fortunate to have acquired this amazing collection. It is like things aligned, and some goodness transferred to me.\nOne of my childhood dreams was to own a set of Encyclopedia Brittanica2 or The World Book3, and this comes pretty close to it. It reminds me of a friend from the past, a kindred spirit, who wanted the same. The past seems like chapters in one of the books I read long ago. Can’t imagine the number of people I lost touch with in the tides of time.\nRather than my usual practice of summarizing books on this blog, I wanted to try something new this time. As I read chapters from the books, I’ll take a passage and ask ChatGPT or Bard a question to reflect on the text, to explore the text’s relevance to contemporary issues. This approach allows me to engage with a chatbot like ChatGPT on a daily basis. It also gives me a feeling of being able to discuss the book with someone.\nIf you’re interested in following along, I’ll be publishing these reflections on Substack robinsonraju.substack.com, and you can sign up for the newsletter to receive updates.\nHere is a Youtube video by Benjamin McEvoy. Loved to see his excitement about owning the set.\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World\nGreat Books of the Western World is a series of books originally published in the United States in 1952, by Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc., to present the great books in a 54-volume set. ↩\n\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica ↩\n\n\nThe World Book Encyclopedia: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Book_Encyclopedia ↩\n\n\n"},"Blog/2023/2023-05-21---The-Iliad":{"slug":"Blog/2023/2023-05-21---The-Iliad","filePath":"Blog/2023/2023-05-21 - The Iliad.md","title":"The Iliad by Homer","links":["Blog/2023/2023-03-31---Reading-the-Great-Books"],"tags":["Fiction","Classics","Epic","Great-Books","book-notes","blog"],"content":"Yay! I finished the first half of the first book in the series. The Iliad!\nAs mentioned in the previous post, 2023-03-31 - Reading the Great Books, as I read The Iliad, I picked a quote/passage, crafted a prompt to tie it to some contemporary issue, and submitted the prompt to ChatGPT and Bard. They definitely gave me interesting answers, which made me think further. I posted them on Substack as and when I read them, usually scheduling the newsletter to go out the next day at midnight.\nI thought I would read a chapter a day and finish by the end of  April, but other priorities took over, and I could finish the book only by today. I was reminded of the movie “Troy” and couldn’t but not think of Brian Cox when Agamemnon came up and Brad Pitt when Achilles. The movie wasn’t entirely faithful to the book, but it was a well-made one.\nHere are the episodes and the posts. I configured Substack to make it free for one month and subscriber-only after that. So if you’re reading this after June 22, 2023, all the episodes on Iliad will be for subscribers only.\nMay 31 update - Took all the Substack posts and converted them into an ebook and published it on Amazon. It was great to get it done on May 31st since that is a key date for me personally. Creating the ebook was a bit tougher in the beginning since the formatting options on kindle create was limited, but in retrospect, I think it was good. With more editing options, I may not have completed the book soon.

We get to know that he had named himself and Pip in his childhood and his actual name is Philip Pirip. He is brought up ‘by hand’ by his sister and brother in law. Brother in law, Joe Gargery, is a blacksmith.\nPip is interrupted by a large, dirty man with prison irons attached to his leg. He demands to know Pip’s name, turns him upside down to empty his pockets, He tells Pip to bring him some food and a file after he gets to know that his uncle is a blacksmith. He tells him that there is a young man with him who will tear is heart and liver out if he doesn’t oblige. Pip runs home frightened.\nChapter II - Pip steals food for the convict\nPip returns to his home. His sister, who is 20 years senior to him, scolds him and asks him where he has been. She reminds him that she brought him up by hand and that he is a burden to her. Her husband, Joe is a mild-mannered person. Mrs. Joe gives Pip and Joe bread and butter fo supper. Pip hides his in his trousers. Joe is surprised that Pip bolted the bread and Mrs. Joe is upset that he swallowed the whole thing. She gives him tar-water as punishment.\nThey discuss about the escaped convicts when they hear gunshots. They live near the coast, near the marshland, where ships that form as jails are docked.\nNext morning is Christmas day. Pip is not able to sleep in the night and early in the morning, he gets up, takes some more food from the pantry, some brandy and runs off to the marshes in search of the convict.\nChapter III - Pip gives food to the convict\nOn his way, he sees man that he thinks is the convict, touches him and gets startled to know that the person is not the person as before. He thinks this is the young man the other man was talking about. The person runs away. Pip walks a bit more and finds the original convict and gives him food and the file. When Pip tells him about the other convict, this man is totally surprised. He gets to file away at the irons on his leg and ignores Pip. Pip slips away and runs towards home.\nChapter IV - Christmas Dinner\nPip rushes home thinking that his theft might have been found out. But is relieved to know that everyone is busy in dinner preparations for Christmas. They have some guests - Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle), Mr. Wopsle (church clerk who has a voice better than the priest) and Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. During dinner Mrs. Joe and Uncle Pumblechook focus on Pip and tell him that he has to be grateful towards his sister. Joe tries to console Pip by pouring some gravy into his plate. Mr. Pumblechook drinks the brandy from the bottle and spits it out discovering that it was tar-water. Pip is frightened thinking that his stealth will get discovered. He is about to run out of the home, opens the door and sees cops outside.\nChapter V - Pip and Joe joins soldiers to search for convicts\nPip is relieved when the soldiers say that they need the services of a blacksmith. So they did not arrive to catch him! The soldiers need help to repair handcuffs. Joe helps with it after that, when they set out to find the fugitives, Joe, Mr. Wopsle and pip join them. After a long search they find them. The two men are found fighting each other in a ditch. The convict tells the soldiers that he was capturing the other convict to bring him to the prison. The soldiers capture both men and take them to the station. Pip wonders if the convict would think that he led the soldiers to them. The convict tells the soldiers that he had stolen some food and file from the blacksmith’s home, thus clearing Pip’s name. Joe says it is ok.\nChapter VI - Pip and Joe get back home\nPip and Joe get back and tell the folks what happened. Everyone wonders how the thief broke in and have multiple theories including him entering through the chimney. Pip does’t tell anyone, not even Joe.\nChapter VII - Pip gets the opportunity to offer services a rich lady\nPip is not old enough to be apprenticed to Joe. So, he attends a school run by Mr. Wopsle’s great aunt. Mr. Wopsle is a tenant of one of the rooms in the building. The building also has a little general shop. The grand-aunt is helped by Biddy who is her grand-daughter. Pip comes home and tries to teach Joe what he has learnt. Joe is super impressed. When asked why Joe didn’t go to school, he talks about his childhood when his dad was a drunkard who beat up him and his mother. Since his mother was abused, he is very careful to note that he would never abuse his wife and is ok to take abuse from her.\nMrs. Joe makes occasional trips with Mr. Pumblechook on market days to assist him to buy household items since he was a bachelor and didn’t trust his servants. One of the days she returns with Mr. Pumblechook to inform Joe and Pip that a rich old lady, Ms. Havisham has asked for a boy and Mr. Pumblechook was gracious enough to suggest Pip. She is very happy and grateful to Mr. Pumblechook for the opportunity. Gets Pip cleaned up for the visit and leaves that night.\nChapter VIII - Pip visits Satis House\nPip stays with Mr. Pumblechook that night and is taken to Ms. Havisham’s mansion the next day. Pumblechook reminds him to be grateful for the opportunity to go into this great house. Though the house is big, it seems very old and not maintained. A gruff young lady greets them, lets only Pip in. While walking she mentions that the name of the house is Manor House or Satis House. She leaves him in a room which doesn’t have outside light coming in but has candles. Pip sees Ms. Havisham dressed in bridal clothes. They look grand but are old and yellow. She asks him to play and he is confused. She then asks him to call Estella. He calls her and they play cards. Estella beats him at the game and insults him for his looks and clothes throughout. He almost cries in front of Estella on the way back but holds back his tears. Pip is so embarrassed by himself that he kicks against a wall on the way back. He realizes that he is a low-life.\nChapter IX - Pip describes events at Satis house\nPip returns home to find everyone very curious to know what happened. Mr. Pumblechook says that he has never seen Ms. Havisham but has had interactions with the house many times on business. Pip is uncomfortable since he is still sad about him being low in the social strata. He invents a story about Ms. Havisham sitting on a black velvet coach, Estella handing her cake and wine on a gold plate, and four large dogs fighting for veal cutlets from a silver basket. They are totally astonished.\nLater Pip tells Joe the truth and he admonishes Pip to not tell lies.\nChapter X - Pip gets money from the convict from the past\nCouple of days later Pip wakes up thinking - best step he could take towards making himself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew. So he goes over and learns from Biddy who is willing to help him with all that she knows.\nOne day, his sister tells Pip to get Joe from a public house named Three Jolly Bargemen on his way back from school, since he goes there in the evenings to smoke. Pip goes there and a man offers them a drink. Joe refuses but the man insists. Pip notices that the man is stirring his drink with the file that Pip had stolen in the past. He gets a fright thinking that his secret would be out. The man gives Pip a shilling wrapped in paper which turns out to be pound notes. Joe goes back thinking it was a mistake but are not able to find the man. Pip has a nightmare about the file in his sleep.\nChapter XI - Pip goes to Ms. Havisham’s again\nIn the last meeting, Ms Havisham had told him to come after 6 days. The day comes and Pip makes a visit to the Manor House. Estella lets him in and takes him to a room where he sees some other people - 3 ladies and a man. A lady named Camilla, who reminded Pip of his sister, a man named Cousin Raymond, another lady named Sarah Pocket, another lady named Georgiana. They look at him and comment about him. He is then taken to another room where there is a wedding cake that is rotten and has insects crawling about them. Ms. Havisham holds Pip’s hand and goes around in the room. She says that when she dies, her body will be on the table with all the people watching.\nPip plays cards with Estella with Ms. Havisham watching. Estella continues to insult him. On his way back, a thin boy approaches him and challenges him for a fight. Pip knocks him down but he always gets up to fight. Finally he gives up. Estella who is waiting at the gate doesn’t ask him why he is late. She grants him a kiss. He kisses her but still feels like a downtrodden person.\nChapter XII - Pip’s appointment at Ms. Havisham’s becomes daily\nNext time when he goes over to the Manor House, Pip is half expecting to be punished or scolded for beating up the thin boy. But he doesn’t find the boy anywhere nor is there any mention of him. He goes in and continues the regular thing of walking with Ms. Havisham in the room and playing with Estella. Sometimes the walk goes on for 3 hours. Ms. Havisham gets to know more about Pip, that he is set to be apprenticed to Joe when he grows older, etc. Pip is expected to go daily and that continues for many months.\nOne day, Ms. Havisham says Pip is old enough to be apprenticed and asks him to call Joe to the Manor House. He gets home and tells the news to Joe and Mrs. Joe. His sister is angry that she wasn’t invited and takes it out on Joe and Pip. She asks Joe why he didn’t marry a slave.\nChapter XIII - Pip’s apprenticeship to Joe is formalized\nThe next day, Pip, Joe and his sister go over to the town. His sister goes to Mr. Pumblechook’s place and Pip and Joe head over to Satis House. Estella opens the gate as usual, doesn’t take any notice of them and leads them to Ms. Havisham’s room. Ms. Havisham asks a few questions to them. Joe answers questions to Pip instead of to Ms. Havisham even for questions directed at him. It embarrasses Pip. Towards the end, Ms. Havisham gives a generous amount of 25 guineas and tells him to give it to his master, Joe.\nThey get back and tell Mrs. Joe and Mr. Pumblechook and they are very surprised at the amount given. As he goes back home, Pip realizes that the job that he once looked forward to, is not exciting anymore. He does not want to be a blacksmith.\nChapter XIV - Pip feels bad about being just a blacksmith\nPip says that it is a miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. He once felt distinguished and happy merely at the thought of becoming Joe’s apprentice but not anymore. As he thinks back, he reminds himself of all the great qualities of Joe. The reason he did not run away or feel out of place, was not because he was virtuous, or faithful, it was because Joe was virtuous, Joe was faithful beyond measure.\nPip is haunted by the fear that Estella would come one day and see him with a black face and hands, dirtied by the job and consider him lower than she already thought and truly despise him.\nChapter XV - Mrs. Joe is attacked\nPip continues to work for Joe. Since he has grown, his education at Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s school is done. Biddy continues to teach him what she knows, Pip tries to learn things from Mr. Wopsle also. He tries to teach Joe what he knows it is not of much use.\nOne day, he asks Joe for half-day off to go to town and see Estella. Joe advises him against it telling him that Ms. Havisham might think that he has gone there to ask for something. Pip is insistent and Joe grants him his wish. Orlick, another chap who works with Joe also asks for half-day telling him that he should treat all employees equally. Joe relents. Mrs. Joe hears this and is totally furious. She asks Joe if he thinks he is so rich that he can afford to waste wages. Quarrel ensues between her and Orlick. Joe beats him up for talking bad to his wife.\nSunday comes and Pip goes to Satis House. Estella doesn’t open the gate, it is Sarah Pocket. Ms. Havisham tells him that Estella has gone away abroad to be educated to become a lady and is prettier than ever, hoping to taunt him.\nPip is in no mood to go home. But goes over slowly. On the way he hears some commotion, someone says there is something wrong at his place. He reaches home to find that someone has broken in and knocked down Mrs. Joe with a very hard blow on her head.\nChapter XVI - Mrs. Joe is paralyzed, Biddy comes to stay to take care of her\nThey discover that the blow was made with the leg-iron that the convict had filed away long back. Mrs. Joe is completely bedridden and Joe and Pip take care of her with difficulty. Mrs. Joe cannot talk and does not know to write.\nLucky for them, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt passes away and Biddy comes to stay with them. She nurses Mrs. Joe and takes care of others.\nMrs. Joe often used to write the symbol of T which Joe or Pip never understood. Biddy surmises that it could mean a hammer. They realize that Mrs. Joe means to say Orlick. They bring in Orlick thinking that she will denounce him as the person who hit her but she is friendly with him and he comes by often after that.\nChapter XVII - Pip confides in Biddy of his desire to become a gentleman\nPip goes to Satis Manor on his birthday to visit Ms. Havisham. She gives him a guinea and tells him to come next yr during his birthday. Pip becomes conscious of Biddy changing into a neat young lady, though not as beautiful as Estella. He asks Biddy how she manages to take care of the house and also catch up with him on all the reading and learning. She reminds him jokingly that she is his first teacher. Pip has heartfelt conversations with Biddy on how he feels. He tells her that he wishes he could be happy as a blacksmith and be with Joe and her but he is not, he wants to be a gentleman. When he tells her than it is on account of a young lady at Ms. Havisham’s, Biddy asks if he wants to be a gentleman to spite her or to win her. She gives the sage advice that both reasons are not good enough and that the lady is not worth winning over. Pip tells her frankly that it would have been easier if he was in love with her than with Estella. Biddy doesn’t mind it and is thankful for his confidence. On the way back home, they meet Orlick and both hate to be with him. She says he has eyes on her and that’s why she doesn’t like him, but it shouldn’t be of Pip’s concern. They get home. Pip’s dissatisfaction with life keep growing and he says that the confusion is fifty thousand fold and is scattering his wits.\nThis is probably the most poignant part of the story yet. One feels sad for Pip, sad for Biddy, and sad for being in a place of unhappiness.\n\n“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?” Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.\n\n\n“I don’t know,” I moodily answered.\n\n\n“Because if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”\n\nChapter XVIII - An anonymous patron bestows wealth on Pip\nIt is the fourth year of his apprenticeship with Joe and on one Saturday evening, while they were in Three Jolly Bargemen, a lawyer presents himself and asks for Pip. Pip and Joe go with him to Joe’s home, and Mr. Jaggers, the lawyer tells them that an anonymous patron wants to gift a property to Pip and fund his training to become a gentleman. At the beginning, Mr. Jaggers asks Joe if he wants money or some form of compensation for relieving Pip from his apprenticeship. Joe says no. Mr. Jaggers tells them that Pip will live in London and he can take training from anyone. Since he doesn’t know anyone, Jaggers suggests Mr. Mathew Pocket whom he has heard of. Pip quickly makes the connection to Ms. Havisham since he had heard the name there. Jaggers gives him money to buy clothes. Joe is dumbfounded. Jaggers again asks if Joe needs any money for the loss of Pip’s services and he says no. When Jaggers insists, Joe gets upset. Jaggers leaves. Pip decides that he will buy clothes but not wear them from the village, lest everyone see. He will wear them from Pumblechook’s home and go to London. Pip tells Biddy and she is happy with the news. Though Joe and Biddy are cheerful, Pip is gloomy at the prospect of leaving. But he is also looking forward to leaving.\nChapter XIX - Pip prepares to leave his village\nPip prepares to leave to town to shop for clothes. He mentions to Joe that if he could read or ‘get on a little more’ with the lessons, he could have come with him to London. Joe mentions that he is awfully dull and it is better for him here. Pip mentions the same to Biddy and she tells him that Joe might actually like it here in the village than in London. Pip thinks it is because of her jealousy. Biddy says he can think what he wants to. Pip goes over to the town. Pumblechook is totally a changed man to him now. He ingratiates himself to Pip by giving him the best food, shaking his hands many times and praises him often. Pip gets his new clothes and dresses himself up in those and goes over to Satis House. Sarah Pocket receives him at the gate and he gets to meet Ms. Havisham who already knows about his good fortune from Mr. Jaggers. Pip goes back to Pumblechook’s place, changes clothes and goes to his village. His packs up and bids good bye to Joe and Biddy, who bid him a tearful good-bye.

Jaggers tells him that he is to ramain with Mr. Pocket’s son at Barnard’s Inn, until Monday and then go to Mr. Pocket’s home. He was given generous allowance and cards of many tradesmen from whom he could make purchases.\nChapter XXI - Pip meets Mr. Pocket’s son\nWemmick, Mr. Jaggers’ assistant, takes Pip over to Barnard’s Inn and Pip is not very impressed by the Inn from outside. Pip views it as an imperfect realization of one of his first great expectations. When they reach the room, they don’t find young Mr. Pocket there. Instead they find a note that says ‘Gone out, back shortly’. Wemmick goes away and Pip waits for the young man to come. He takes a bit of time but eventually comes. He says that he had gone out to the market to get some fruits for Pip. When they get to see each other, Pip realizes that the young boy is the same ‘pale young gentleman’ that he had beaten up at Satis House, for which he got a kiss from Estella! Both are surprised.\nChapter XXII - Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham’s sad story\nPip finds that Herbert, Mr. Pocket’s son, is a very amiable person. He tells him that Estella was adopted by Ms. Havisham and that he didn’t care much for being betrothed to her. During dinner, Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham’s story. While eating, he also teaches Pip upper class manners whenever a chance comes. He gives Pip the name of Handel, after a famous composer.\nThis quote about Pip’s impression of Herbert, caught my eye -\n\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich.\n\nI stopped reading the book and thought about myself at that moment!\nMs. Havisham’s Story - Ms. Havisham’s father was a country gentleman and also a brewer. After her mother died when she was young, her father denied her nothing and in his doting, he made her a spoit child.

Pip makes a visit to Mr. Pocket’s house after a few days. He finds Mrs. Pocket sitting at a place and reading not bothering about her children. Two maid servants take care of the kids.

He takes Pip to court to see Jaggers in action and Pip is very impressed at the respect and fear that Jaggers commands.\nChapter XXV - Pip visits Wemmick’s Castle\nOther students of Mr. Pocket are introduced.

Wemmick tells Pip that Jaggers never locks his door and challenges anyone to rob him.\nPip reaches the home and finds it to be a fancy one. Wemmick calls it ‘The Castle’. He designed, architected and built the home. It even has a drawbridge and canon (named Stinger). He has an elderly father who he calls ‘The Aged’. There is a little girl who takes care of the Aged.

He is relieved that Joe was coming to Barnard’s Inn and not to Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket’s home) since he didn’t want Drummle to meet Joe and judge Pip that he has relatives of low status.\nPip has furnished his apartment very lavishly and even has a servant whom he calls The Avenger.\nJoe comes and it is evident that he is not very comfortable in the lavish settings. While they were talking Herbert comes in and is excited to see Joe and talks to him well. Joe tells them that he is in town to see Mr. Wopsle act in a play. Wopsle had left church and now was a full time actor.\nAfter Herbert is gone, Joe tells Pip that he is actually here as a messenger. Ms. Havisham had asked to see him and that Estella was in town. She had sent a word through Pumblechook. Biddy had told Joe that it might be better to inform Pip by word than by letter.\nJoe doesn’t stay for dinner and goes away.\nChapter XXVIII - Pip is on his way to visit Ms. Havisham\nPip decides to make a visit to Satis House. He does a lot of thinking about what to do. Should he stay at Joe’s place? Should he take the Avenger? What if Trabb’s boy tells Avenger unsavory things about his childhood? etc. He decides to stay at the Blue Boar Inn and not to take the Avenger.\nPip finds that in the coach that he takes, two convicts are also being transported. He recognizes one person as the one who gave him two one pound notes. Pip tries his best to avoid the convicts and being recognized.\nThe convicts don’t have a place in the back so they are put in the front much to the dismay of other passengers.\nPip overhears the convicts talking and one of them says that another person had asked him to give two one pound notes to a boy who had fed him and kept his secret. He had done it, though his companion tells him that it was a foolish thing to do hinting that he should have just taken the money. He goes on to say that the other man got charged for escaping prison and got a life sentence.\nPip gets even more alarmed after hearing the conversation thinking that he convict might recognize him soon. So as soon as the town comes, he gets down and walks the rest of the way. At the Inn, the waiter recognizes him and asks if he should send for Mr. Pumblechook.

He realizes that he loves Estella against reason, against promise, against all discouragement.\nLater in the morning, he goes to Satis House and is surprised to find Orlick opening the gate. He tells that he left the forge after Pip left and joined as a porter here. Pip goes along the corridor to meet Ms. Havisham and meets Sarah Pocket on the way. He tells her that Mr. Pocket and family are well.\nThere is a young lady by Ms. Havisham’s side whom Pip doesn’t recognize. But when she lifts her eyes, he recognizes that it is Estella. She has returned from France and is to go to London to be introduced to society.\nLater, Pip and Estella walk around the property and Estella tells Pip that she had watched Pip and Herbert fight, in secret.

In the next day’s post, he also writes a letter to Mr. Trabb saying that he will not do business with him due to the boy’s conduct.\nPip confesses to Herbert about his love for Estella which Herbert had already guessed. Herbert also mentions to him that since Mr. Jaggers never mentioned Estella, marrying her may not be a condition or wish from his benefactor who he thinks is probably Ms. Havisham.

A person whom he would kill right now if he met him, he is the person who Magwitch was fighting with on the ditch as a convict many years back.

Compeyson and Magwitch go about swindling and forgery, with Magwitch doing all the work and Compeyson underpaying him. They eventually get caught but the judge passes harsher sentence on Magwitch by his looks and lighter one on Compeyson thinking that he was a gentleman who was influenced badly by Magwitch.\nDuring the imprisonment, Magwitch escapes and he gets to know from Pip that Compeyson had also escaped. So he fights with Compeyson and makes sure to put him in jail though it costs him his freedom.\nHerbert passes Pip a note telling him that “Young Havisham’s name was Arthur.

It is a description of Egdon heath as a powerful force of nature, as nature itself. One can almost visualize the twilight as though one is right there. About the twilight he says, it is the time of the day where when a worker looks up, he might continue to work but when he looks down or around, he might feel like it is getting darker and is time to wind up. Hardy calls the heath as a wasteland that is vast and lonely. It has brown vegetation. But he goes on to say that is has been there since prehistoric times and has been unaltered as the stars above though everything around has changed over time. He contrasts it with the sea that is renewed frequently - ‘distilled by the Sun and kneaded by the moon’! The sea changed, the fields changed, the rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained. He gives an imposing persona to the heath.\n2 - Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble\nMeaning of the title = Reddleman appears with a woman (trouble) on his carriage. An old man who meets them on the way gets to know that there is a woman in the carriage and probably adds to the trouble.\nA old man with a walking stick, wearing an ancient boat-cloak (cloak worn by naval officers) is seen walking alone. He sees a van far away and catches up to it. It was that of a reddleman, a person who sells reddles to the villages. Reddles are red seeds that are used to mark sheep when they are sold in fairs. The trade makes the person who sells red since the pigment spreads on clothes and skin during handling.\nThe reddleman is not much of a talker but since he keeps going to the back of the van to check upon something, the old man inquires and is told that there is a lady. The old man tries to extract more information but cannot. They part ways when the reddleman says that his ponies need to rest.\nIt is getting darker and the reddleman looks towards the horizon and sees a woman near the barrow on top of the mountain. After a short while, she goes away and more people come in.\n3 - The Custom of the Country\nMeaning of the title = Custom of the Country is to light a bonfire on the 5th of Nov.\nThis is a long chapter and there is a good amount of dialogue in it. After the first two chapters ended with no characters being named, here many are introduced.\nThe group that gathered around are children, men and women of the neighboring hamlets and they’ve come to light bonfires. Across the heath, you can see bonfires at different places and they’re doing it to celebrate some custom. Hardy says people have been lighting bonfires since ancient times of the Druids. Even if the reasons change, the custom remains.\n\nTo light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man when, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded throughout Nature. It indicates a spontaneous, Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat that this recurrent season shall bring foul times, cold darkness, misery and death. Black chaos comes, and the fettered gods of the earth say, Let there be light.\n\nThe people around the bonfire include Grandfer Cantle, his son Christian, Timothy Fairway, Humphrey, Sam, Susan Nunsuch, Olly Dowden. Grandfer is quite a jolly person who sings songs and dances. Christian is just over 30 yrs and says that no woman would marry him. The folks are quite superstitious and they say that he lacks virility since there was no moon when he was born. They also say that single sleepers are visited by ghosts.\nThey talk about the marriage of Thomasin Yeobright and Wildeve that was to happen earlier that day. They mean to go to Wildeve’s inn and sing a song later. The marriage was opposed by Thomasin’s aunt openly in the church and later she had agreed. They also mention that Mrs. Yeobright’s son Clym is soon returning and they seem to have an admiration for him. They look at a bonfire a bit faraway that is burning steadily and mention that it might be due to wood being used. They mention that it might be by Eustacia, Captain Vye’s granddaughter. They don’t speak favorably of her.\nThey dance as the fire dies out, Christian gets frightened when reddleman appears who has come towards them asking the way to Mrs. Yeobright’s house. A few minutes after the reddleman leaves, Mrs.Yeobright comes. She takes Olly and goes towards Wildeve’s Inn, The Quite Woman.\n\nPersons with any weight of character carry, like planets, their atmospheres along with them in their orbits.\n\n4 - The Halt on the Turnpike Road\nMeaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright halts to talk to Diggory Venn and finds out the bad news.\nMrs. Yeobright and Olly walk down the hill and when they reach the road Olly goes towards her home and as Mrs. Yeobright is about to enter the Inn, she sees a horse and a van nearby and the reddlemen walking alongside. She goes and talks to him to find out that her neice is no in Wildeve’s Inn but in the carriage, that she did not get married earlier in the day as expected. Thomasin gets down from the carriage, Mrs. Yeobright and she walk toward the Inn to confront Wildeve.\n5 - Perplexity among Honest People\nMeaning of the title = Probably indicates the surprise in the village folk who came to dance and found Thomasin inside and not outside with Wildeve\nShe says that if he promised to marry her, he must do it, otherwise, it would bring great shame to the family. Wildeve explains that it couldn’t happen because of an issue with licence. They had gone to Anglebury to register the marriage but since it was made out for Budmouth, it wasn’t useful in Anglebury. Thomasin tries to defend Wildeve. She says that she was upset and decided to come back by herself and not with Wildeve and that it was not his mistake. Wildeve promises that the marriage will happen in a couple of days.\nIn the mean time, the earlier group of people come to celebrate the wedding. Wildeve asks the Yeobrights to stay in the room while he goes to entertain. He gives them drinks and chats with them. They leave and when he comes back, he finds the Yeobrights to have already left by the open window at the back.\nHe looks outside and sees one bonfire still being lit and knows that it is a sign for him. He goes towards it.\n6 - The Figure against the Sky\nMeaning of the title = Figure against the sky that reddleman saw was Eustacia\nIn the chapter we learn that the old man who had spoken to reddlemen was Eustacia’s grandfather. He had put one-and-one together and informed Eustacia that probably the marriage didn’t happen. She lights the fire to signal Wildeve to come to her thinking that he called of the wedding in the last minute because of her.\nShe has asked Johnny Nunsuch, a boy in the neighborhood to tend to the bonfire and goes once in a while to the barrow to check on Wildeve’s Inn through a telescope and then comes back. She asks the boy if he heard a frog jump on the lake to which he replies no. Her grandfather asks her to come indoors and she says she will. After a while, the boy tells her that he heard a frog jump. She sends him off with a sixpence and we see Wildeve coming over after the boy leaves. He tells her that she does not give him peace with the lighted bonfire that does not die out. She tells that she is upset that he chose Thomasin over her. But that she is glad that he didn’t marry due to his love for her. Wildeve explains that it was no the case and it was due to a licence issue. But they continue to chat about their love for each other. She doesn’t allow him to kiss her though. He leaves and she goes to sleep.\n7 - Queen of Night\nMeaning of the title = Description of Eustacia as a Queen\nThis chapter is a detailed character sketch of Eustacia. She is described as exceptionally beautiful. Her father was a bandmaster in the navy and was lucky to have married the captain’s daughter. Her grandfather was not quite happy about it since he was from a noble family. Other aristocratic roots, comparisons to greek gods are also made. She is also portrayed as a very passionate person who has highly romantic notions in her head.\n\nFidelity in love for fidelity’s sake had less attraction for her than for most women; fidelity because of love’s grip had much. A blaze of love, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same which should last long years.\n\nThough she grew up in Budmouth, she is now at Edgon heath with her grandfather after he dad passed away. She hates being here and is always in expectation of something grand to happen.\n\nTo dwell on a heath without studying its meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue. The subtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia; she only caught its vapours. An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet, a suffering woman a devotee, a pious woman a psalmist, even a giddy woman thoughtful, made a rebellious woman saturnine.\n\n8 - Those Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody\nMeaning of the title = The boy Johnny finds Wildeve and Eustacia together and later stumbles upon Diggory Venn.\nThe boy Johnny Nunsuch is going towards his home happy with the money he got from Eustacia. On the way he gets frightened with something and decides to go back and ask Eustacia to lend a servant to walk back with him. But once he reaches there he finds Eustacia talking to Wildeve and he is caught in what Hardy calls as ‘Scyllaeo-Charybdean’ position (after rock and a whirlpool in greek mythology). He decides to not disturb them, musters courage and goes towards his home.\nOn the way back, he gets frightened of something and slips and falls near Diggory Venn. Venn asks him some questions and finds out about Wildeve meeting with Eustacia.\n9 - Love Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy\nMeaning of the title = Diggory Venn hatches a plan to eavesdrop on Wildeve and Eustacia.\nHardy explains that women used to scare their children by saying ‘the reddleman is coming for you’. He says that ordinary people don’t take up the trade though it is vanishing. Reddlemen are wanderers like gypsies but they look down upon gypsies. Sometimes people take up the reddle trade as a penance after some wrongdoing.\nVenn returns to his van and takes up an old letter to read. It is a letter from Thomasin where she explain why she couldn’t marry him. She does see him that way. Looks like the spurned marriage offer is what made Venn to leave his father’s dairy farming and go into reddle trade. He still cares for Thomasin and is upset and Eustacia and Wildeve are causing pain to her.\nSince the boy had told him that Eustacia and Wildeve had agreed to meet on the Rainbarrow, Venn goes there daily to see if they are. The first three days pass by withouth incident. The fourth day, he sees them meet. He hides in a nearby bush and manages to overhear the conversation. Wildeve wants Eustacia to go away to America but she does not say yes or no. They depart.\nVenn goes back to his van and decides to have a word with Eustacia.\n10 - A Desperate Attempt at Persuasion\nMeaning of the title = Diggory Venn tries to persuade Eustacia\nVenn goes to Mistover Knap first thing the next morning. He sees the grandfather at the entrance who offers him a drink. Venn says he is there to meet Ms. Vye. Since it is too early, he doesn’t get to meet in spite of waiting for some time. So he goes outside and waits while walking around. She comes after some time. He broaches the subject of Wildeve and Thomasin but she doesn’t take the hint. He then comes in the open an accuses her of the person who is holding the marriage by controlling Wildeve. He asks her to release Wildeve. She is shocked. But refuses by saying “he was mine before he was hers! He came back because he liked me best!“. Since he knows that she hates the heath, he even offers her employment in Budmouth through a reference from his uncle. But she still refuses.\n11 - The Dishonesty of an Honest Woman\nMeaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright tells Wildeve that she is going to give Thomasin to another suitor though she had said no to Diggory.\nAs Venn is walking back towards his van, he sees Mrs. Yeobright walking towards the Quiet Women to meet Wildeve. He goes over and talks to her. He doesn’t tell her why he thinks Wildeve may not marry Thomasin since he knows that Eustacia has him fully charmed. He proposes his hand in marriage. But Mrs. Yeobright doesn’t agree since Thomasin hadn’t agreed two years ago.\nWith this new information, Mrs. Yeobright goes into the Inn and talks to Wildeve. In order to force his hand, she says that Thomasin has another suitor who is ready to marry her. Wildeve is surprised. Contrary to what Mrs. Yeobright expected, he doesn’t commit.\nLater that evening, he goes to meet Eustacia and tells her that their path is clear since Thomasin has another suitor and that she is not interested in him anymore. Eustacia is shocked by this and almost immediately loses interest in him. “What was the man worth whom a woman inferior to herself did not value?”, she says to herself. She doesn’t commit and tells him that she will give a final answer on Monday at 8 by the Rainbarrrow.\nLater that night, her grandfather returns and tells her that Mrs. Yeobright’s son Clym Yeobright is coming home to spend Christmas with his mother. He is coming back from Paris where he had spent the last decade.\nBOOK TWO THE ARRIVAL\n1 - Tidings of the Comer\nMeaning of the title = Eustacia overhears news of Clym who is about to come to Egdon.\nOne day, late in the afternoon around 3 PM, Eustacia is standing in the kitchen near the chimney and she could hear men talking outside. The men would be Sam and Humphrey, the furze cutters, who are stacking up the furze, closely watched by Captain Vye. They’re talking about Clym as they do their work. They’re proud of him and hold him in high esteem. He is said to be working for a diamond merchant in Paris. After the captain leaves, they talk among themselves, saying that if there was anyone who was a match for Clym it was Eustacia.\nEustacia spends the whole afternoon daydreaming about Clym. Later in the evening, she decides to go and have a look at Yeobrights’ home.\n2 - The People at Blooms-End Make Ready\nMeaning of the title = Mrs. Yeobright and Thomasin are getting ready for Clym’s arrival.\nMrs. Yeobright and Thomasin has busy preparing for Clym’s arrival, Thomasin is on the attic to gather apples. Both are talking as they do their work. After that, they go out to gather berries. Thomasin tells her aunt to not mention the marriage with Wildeve to Clym. Mrs. Yeobright again points out that Wildeve is not the saint that her niece thought to be. She also tells her about her dialogue with Wildeve where she mentioned about another suitor.\n3 - How a Little Sound Produced a Great Dream\nMeaning of the title = A little hello from Clym in the darkness sends Eustacia’s imagination wild.\nEustacia is near Blooms-End but does not see any motion or light there. As she is going back, she sees 2 women and a man coming on the way. As they reach nearer, she knows that the women and Mrs. Yeobright and her neice. The man says “Good Night”. Since it is darks, she is not able to hear him.\nShe thinks of the voice the whole night and has vivid dreams in the night. For the next few nights, she walks around the heath to catch a glimpse of him by some chance encounter but it doesn’t happen.\n4 - Eustacia Is Led on to an Adventure\nMeaning of the title = Eustacia dresses up as a Turkish knight to have a glimpse at Clym\nEustacia’s grandfather gives permission to the mummers to come and practice in his fuelhouse. Eustacia watches them practicing and comes to know that they are going to perform at Blooms-End on Monday night. She sees this as a great opportunity to see Clym since she was afraid that he might go away after Christmas. She influences Charley to take a break on the day when they’re going to play at Blooms-End and let her play the part diguising as someone else, instead. In exchange he gets to kiss her hand.\nCharley is one of the Egdon mummers for the present year, and he and the other mummers practice in Captain Vye’s house for the play “Saint George.” On the night they are to perform in Mrs. Yeobright’s house, Eustacia arranges to take Charley’s place in order to see Clym and study him in the guise of the Turkish Knight. Some of the boys recognize her.\n5 - Through the Moonlight\nMeaning of the title = The title is probably a nod to the band of mummers walking through the moonlight to Blooms-End to perform.\nMonday evening comes and as decided, Eustacia joins the mummers in disguise, goes over to Yeobrights’ home and plays the part.\n6 - The Two Stand Face to Face\nMeaning of the title = Eustacia and Clym meet face to face.\nEustacia rests after the play an surveys the room to look for Clym. She gets her chance to see him. When she sees him talking to Thomasin, she regrets having come in disguise thinking that in her natural form she could have charmed him. Mrs. Yeobright asks the mummers to stay for dinner and they’re happy. The mummers were not in a hurry to leave. So she goes outside to wait for them while watching the moon. Clym comes by and asks her if she were a women disguised as Turkish knight. She says yes but doesn’t reveal who she is. Having accomplished what she came to do, she doesn’t wait for others and goes home.\nWhile returning, Eustacia remembers that it is Monday night and she had an appointment with Wildeve to let him know her decision. But since the time has passed and she is no longer interested in him, she is now indifferent.\n7 - A Coalition between Beauty and Oddness\nMeaning of the title = Venn and Eustacia partner up to make Wildeve marry Thomasin.\nVenn meets with Eustacia and tells her that he saw Wildeve waiting at the Rainbarrow for a long time previous night. He is sure that Wildeve will go again tonight and tells her that he can take a letter to him if needed. Eustacia writes a letter saying that she is no more interested in Wildeve. Venn delivers the letter and Wildeve decides to marry Thomasin to make Eustacia suffer. The next day, Wildeve goes to Blooms-End and asks Thomasin. She accepts in order to protect the pride of her family.\n8 - Firmness Is Discovered in a Gentle Heart\nMeaning of the title = Thomasin, the gentle heart is firm this time on marrying Wildeve, before Clym is back, also not to have Mrs. Yeobright at the wedding so as to not embarass her.\nThomasin goes ahead with marriage. When Clym returns Mrs. Yeobright tells him the story. He feels sad and wants to attend the wedding. While he is on his way, he sees Diggory Venn who tells him that it is over. The person who gave the bride away was Eustacia Vye. This is the first time Clym hears about Eustacia.\nBOOK THREE THE FASCINATION\n1 - “My Mind to Me a Kingdom Is”\nMeaning of the title = Refers to Clym saying that his mind would be put to better use as a schoolteacher than as a clerk in a diamond shop.\nClym Yeobright was famous in the neighborhood from his childhood. He was a bright kid, people were in awe of him and began to always expect great things from him. Hardy mentions a quote by a Jesuit here → “It is bad when your fame outruns your means.”. Probably, the hype around him was greater than he could match. So, when he went to Paris to work, the expectation grew even higher.\nSo, when he says, during haircutting at Fairways, that he is leaving behind his excellent job in Paris and staying back at Egdon to start a school, people are surprised. They commend his good-heartedness but feel that he would learn things in a few weeks.\n2 - The New Course Causes Disappointment\nMeaning of the title = Clym’s mother is disappointed at his decision to leave behind a well paying job.\nHardy mentions that over-idealism and zealousness are not characters of a well-balanced mind.\n\nA well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer.\n\nHe goes on to say that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity.\nClym’s mother is shocked by his decision and tells him that everyone thinks of going forward in life and his decision is definitely a step backward. While they are discussing, Christian Cantle comes in and says that Susan Nunsuch had pricked Eustacia Vye in the church to verify if she were a witch. Eustacia had fainted. Clym’s curiosity is aroused and he wants to know more about Eustacia. He puts one and one together and wonders if Eustacia had come to his house disguised as a Turkish knight the other day. Sam says that few folks are going over to Captain Vye’s home later that day to retrieve a bucket that has falled into the well and he could get to meet Eustacia if he wants to.\n3 - The First Act in a Timeworn Drama\nMeaning of the title = People falling in love is a timeworn drama and the first chapter in Clym and Eustacia’s love affair happens here.\nClym goes over to Captain Vye’s house to help with the fallen bucket. Eustacia watches from a window as the men try to take it out. They’re not able to and leave to come back next day. Clym stays back and talks to Eustacia. Since she says there is no water other than the one in the pool which is dirty, he decides to use a pail to get some water from the well, asks her to hold one end of the rope but in the process, Eustacia gets injured when the rope drags off her palm and takes the skin off. They talk and he tells her of his desire to become a schoolteacher and thinks that she would be a good help since she is an educated woman. After that, they meet often, much to the disappointment of his mother. His mother thinks that he decided to stay back due to Eustacia.\n4 - An Hour of Bliss and Many Hours of Sadness\nMeaning of the title = Clym longs to be in some world where personal ambition was not the only recognized form of progress, looks at the moon before the lunar eclipse, feels contented, Eustacia comes in and they profess love. But this leads to many hours of sadness in future.\nClym meets Eustacia at the Rainbarrow during a lunar eclipse and proposes to her. He wants him to talk about Paris and does not give a definite answer. She still thinks that he will come around and change his mind about not going back to Paris.\nWhen Mrs. Yeobright finds out that Clym and Eustacia have been meeting frequently, she is shocked at the second bitter thing that her son has done.\n5 - Sharp Words Are Spoken, and a Crisis Ensues\nMeaning of the title = Arguments between Clym and his mother.\nWhen Mrs. Yeobright comes back from a visit to Thomasin’s home, she says that Captain has been telling everyone about Clym’s engagement to Eustacia. It is sad to know that she got to know from outside and not from her own son. Mrs. Yeobright doesn’t have a good opinion of Eustacia or her family and doesn’t think that is a right match. They argue very badly.\nHe goes out of the home, talks to Eustacia and tells her that they should get married right away. He tells her about his plan to temporarily rent a cottage until he is able to set up a school and move to Budmouth.\n6 - Yeobright Goes, and the Breach Is Complete\nMeaning of the title = Clym goes away from his home and the relationship is severed.\nClym goes away from his house. Thomasin comes over and tries to console Mrs. Yeobright but she is not able to get her out of sadness. Thomasin says that she might need money since Wildeve doesn’t give her anything. Mrs. Yeobright says that she has money left by her uncle to be dived between her and Clym. She will give it later when she comes by.\nWildeve learns of Eustacia’s wedding to Clym and is surprised. He now feels like he made a mistake in marrying Thomasin and should have gone for Eustacia.\n7 - The Morning and the Evening of a Day\nMeaning of the title = Two major events happen - one in the morning (Clym’s wedding), another in the evening (Christian losing Mrs. Yeobright’s money through gambling)\nClym gets married. Thomasin attends but Mrs. Yeobright does not. Wildeve comes over to pickup a package that Thomasin said Mrs. Yeobright would give. Mrs. Yeobright wanted to give money to Thomasin and Clym as a surprise. Since it is money, she doesn’t give it to Wildeve. He doesn’t know that it is money but feels bad for the lack of trust.\nMrs. Yeobright gives the money to Christian Cantle asking him to give one half to Thomasin and another to Clym as wedding gift. On the way, Christian stops at Wildeve’s Inn and does some gambling. He wins and likes the game. During the course he reveals that he needs to go to Mistover to give a gift to Thomasin. Wildeve is intrigued. He says he will walk with him. On the way, Christian reveals that he is carrying money for Thomasin. Wildeve asks Christian to play a game of dice. He wins over the money and sends Christian empty handed.\n8 - A New Force Disturbs the Current\nMeaning of the title = Reference to Diggory Venn interceding and winning the money back.\nVenn was watching the whole scene from the shadows and saw how Wildeve cheated Christian out of the money. He invites Wildeve to play dice and wins all the money back. Later, Venn meets Thomasin and gives her all the money without realizing that half of it was meant for Clym.\nBOOK FOUR THE CLOSED DOOR\n1 - The Rencounter by the Pool\nMeaning of the title = Rencounter means meet face to face, as in a battle. This refers to the meeting b/w Mrs. Yeobright and Eustacia.\nClym and Eustacia, in their little house at Alderworth, beyond East Egdon, are living on happily. Clym spends his time studying. Eustacia is still hopeful that he will decide to return to Paris.  In the meantime, Mrs. Yeobright would be wondering why Clym never sent a thank you note for the money. Thomasin had sent it couple of days after receiving it. Mrs. Yeobright questions Christian and gets to know that he didn’t do what he was asked off and had lost all the money to Wildeve.\nMrs. Yeobright thinks that may be Wildeve gave it to Thomasin and Eustacia. When Eustacia visits her grandfather’s house, Mrs. Yeobright goes over and asks her about it. She is puzzled and thinks that her mother-in-law is accusing her of taking money and they end up fighting.\n2 - He Is Set upon by Adversities but He Sings a Song\nMeaning of the title = Clym loses his sight and in spite of the difficulties, is seen singing.\nEustacia goes back and tells Clym of the bitter quarrel and says that she will never see his mother again. She insists on going away at the earliest. Clym then doubles down on his studies. In the meantime, Thomasin goes over and gives Clym’s share of the money to him.\nClym’s reading results in him becoming almost blind due to inflammation of the eye. He can read no more and instead of sitting idle, he takes up furze-cutting. Eustacia refers to the job as slavery and is mortified and embarassed. One day, she sees him singing at work and is totally surprised that he actually enjoys doing the menial job. She is heartbroken and tells him that she wants to go home.\n3 - She Goes Out to Battle against Depression\nMeaning of the title = Eustacia goes out for a dance.\nEustacia is quite saddened by Clym being happy as a furze-cutter in spite of being a polymath who has travelled around the world. She says she wants to go to the village festival and have a good time. Clym tells her to go since he is not much interested. She dresses herself and goes. An acquaintance who was supposed to be there is not there and she is left alone. She looks at people who are dancing and feels sad that there is no one to dance with. She decides to go back home and surprisingly, Wildeve comes by. They dance and she is happy. He escorts her back and on the way they see Venn and Clym walking together towards them. Wildeve takes another way thinking that they may be misunderstood. Venn spots him before he leaves.\nVenn goes over to the Inn and tells Thomasin that he saw Wildeve with a horse earlier. Thomasin asks Wildeve in the night where he had gone. He says he went to the town to buy a horse but couldn’t get it. She then says that Venn saw him with a horse. He denies it.\n4 - Rough Coercion Is Employed\nMeaning of the title = Venn fires on Wildeve with a gun to scare him.\nWildeve is seen loitering around Clym’s house to get a glimpse of Eustacia in the nights. He walks over, sees the home and then goes back. One day, he decides to signal Eustacia using a moth. He does it and she knows it is him and she gets frightened. Then they hear a knock on their door.

He thinks that Venn is going to shoot him to death that night.\nVenn goes over to Blooms-End and tells Mrs. Yeobright of Clym’s condition, asks her to reconcile herself with her son and daughter-in-law.

She is not sure of the way, so wanders off. Someone tells her to follow a furze-cutter who is also going the same way. She sees him from far and follows him, recognizes after sometime that it is her son. He goes into his home and falls asleep due to tiredness. She takes rest on the way.

He was a descendant of Alcaeus, son of Hercules. (View Highlight)\nNow as for the carrying off of women, it is the deed, they say, of a rogue: but to make a stir about such as are carried off, argues a man a fool. Men of sense care nothing for such women, since it is plain that without their own consent they would never be forced away. The Asiatics, when the Greeks ran off with their women, never troubled themselves about the matter; but the Greeks, for the sake of a single Lacedaemonian girl, collected a vast armament, invaded Asia, and destroyed the kingdom of Priam. Henceforth they ever looked upon the Greeks as their open enemies. (View Highlight)\nthis Candaules was in love with his own wife; and not only so, but thought her the fairest woman in the whole world. This fancy had strange consequences. (View Highlight)\nI shall therefore discourse equally of both, convinced that human happiness never continues long in one stay. (View Highlight)\nOur fathers, in time past, distinguished right and wrong plainly enough, and it is our wisdom to submit to be taught by them. (View Highlight)\nFor among the Lydians, and indeed among the barbarians generally, it is reckoned a deep disgrace, even to a man, to be seen naked. (View Highlight)\nWhen Gyges was established on the throne, he sent no small presents to Delphi, as his many silver offerings at the Delphic shrine testify. Besides this silver he gave a vast number of vessels of gold, among which the most worthy of mention are the goblets, six in number, and weighing altogether thirty talents, (View Highlight)\nthere is to this day at Tarnarum, an offering of Arion’s at the shrine, which is a small figure in bronze, representing a man seated upon a dolphin. (View Highlight)\nGlaucus, the Chian, made it, the man who first invented the art of inlaying steel. (View Highlight)\nI am curious therefore to inquire of thee, whom, of all the men that thou hast seen, thou deemest the most happy? (View Highlight)\nFor assuredly he who possesses great store of riches is no nearer happiness than he who has what suffices for his daily needs, unless it so hap that luck attend upon him, and so he continue in the enjoyment of all his good things to the end of life. (View Highlight)\nGod showed forth most evidently, how much better a thing for man death is than life. (View Highlight)\nthere is no country which contains within it all that it needs, but each, while it possesses some things, lacks others, and the best country is that which contains the most; (View Highlight)\nno single human being is complete in every respect (View Highlight)\nHe who unites the greatest number of advantages, and retaining them to the day of his death, then dies peaceably, that man alone, sire, is, in my judgment, entitled to bear the name of ‘happy.’ But in every matter it behoves us to mark well the end: for oftentimes God gives men a gleam of happiness, and then plunges them into ruin. (View Highlight)\nWait till the time shall come when a mule is monarch of Media; Then, thou delicate Lydian, away to the pebbles of Hermus; (View Highlight)\nGreeks have been from very ancient times distinguished from the barbarians by superior sagacity and freedom from foolish simpleness, and remembering that the persons on whom this trick was played were not only Greeks but Athenians, who have the credit of surpassing all other Greeks in cleverness. (View Highlight)\nThe answer of the Pythoness was that before they could prevail, they must remove to Sparta the bones of Orestes, the son of Agamemnon. (View Highlight)\nwho feed not on what they like, but on what they can get from a soil that is sterile and unkindly; who do not indulge in wine, but drink water; who possess no figs nor anything else that is good to eat. If, then, thou conquerest them, what canst thou get from them, seeing that they have nothing at all? But if they conquer thee, consider how much that is precious thou wilt lose: if they once get a taste of our pleasant things, they will keep such hold of them that we shall never be able to make them loose their grasp. (View Highlight)\nOaths are taken by these people in the same way as by the Greeks, except that they make a slight flesh wound in their arms, from which each sucks a portion of the other’s blood. (View Highlight)\nThe reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the enemy’s horse was because the horse has a natural dread of the camel, and cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that animal. (View Highlight)\nsince the snake, said they, is a child of earth, and the horse a warrior and a foreigner. (View Highlight)\nNo one is so foolish as to prefer war to peace, in which, instead of sons burying their fathers, fathers bury their sons. But the gods willed it so. (View Highlight)\nbut if he neither understood what was said, nor took the trouble to seek for enlightenment, he has only himself to blame for the result. (View Highlight)\n\nPart 2\n\nIt appeared on measurement that the portion of the courtesans was the largest. The daughters of the common people in Lydia, one and all, pursue this traffic, wishing to collect money for their portions. They continue the practice till they marry; and are wont to contract themselves in marriage. (View Highlight)\nSo far as we have any knowledge, they were the first nation to introduce the use of gold and silver coin, and the first who sold goods by retail. They claim also the invention of all the games which are common to them with the Greeks. (View Highlight)\nThe plan adopted against the famine was to engage in games one day so entirely as not to feel any craving for food, and the next day to eat and abstain from games. In this way they passed eighteen years. Still the affliction continued and even became more grievous. So the king determined to divide the nation in half, and to make the two portions draw lots, the one to stay, the other to leave the land. (View Highlight)\n“We cannot possibly,” they said, “go on living in this country if things continue as they now are; let us therefore set a king over us, that so the land may be well governed, and we ourselves may be able to attend to our own affairs, and not be forced to quit our country on account of anarchy.” (View Highlight)\nIt was his conviction that justice and injustice are engaged in perpetual war with one another. (View Highlight)\nHe allowed no one to have direct access to the person of the king, but made all communication pass through the hands of messengers, and forbade the king to be seen by his subjects. (View Highlight)\nhe was the first who gave organisation to an Asiatic army, dividing the troops into companies, and forming distinct bodies of the spearmen, the archers, and the cavalry, who before his time had been mingled in one mass, and confused together. (View Highlight)\nif they saw him frequently would be pained at the sight, and would therefore be likely to conspire against him; whereas if they did not see him, they would think him quite a different sort of being from themselves. (View Highlight)\nThe Scythians who plundered the temple were punished by the goddess with the female sickness, which still attaches to their posterity. (View Highlight)\nThus after a reign of thirty-five years, Astyages lost his crown, and the Medes, in consequence of his cruelty, were brought under the rule of the Persians. (View Highlight)\nOf all the days in the year, the one which they celebrate most is their birthday. (View Highlight)\nThey eat little solid food but abundance of dessert, which is set on table a few dishes at a time (View Highlight)\nthey have no images of the gods, no temples nor altars, and consider the use of them a sign of folly. This comes, I think, from their not believing the gods to have the same nature with men, as the Greeks imagine. (View Highlight)\nThey are very fond of wine, and drink it in large quantities (View Highlight)\nTo vomit or obey natural calls in the presence of another is forbidden among them. (View Highlight)\nIt is also their general practice to deliberate upon affairs of weight when they are drunk; and then on the morrow, when they are sober, the decision to which they came the night before is put before them by the master of the house in which it was made; and if it is then approved of, they act on it; if not, they set it aside. Sometimes, however, they are sober at their first deliberation, but in this case they always reconsider the matter under the influence of wine. (View Highlight)\nthey look upon themselves as very greatly superior in all respects to the rest of mankind, regarding others as approaching to excellence in proportion as they dwell nearer to them; (View Highlight)\nThere is no nation which so readily adopts foreign customs as the Persians. (View Highlight)\nThe most disgraceful thing in the world, they think, is to tell a lie; the next worst, to owe a debt: (View Highlight)\nAs soon as they hear of any luxury, they instantly make it their own: and hence, among other novelties, they have learnt unnatural lust from the Greeks. Each of them has several wives, and a still larger number of concubines. (View Highlight)\nThey never defile a river with the secretions of their bodies, nor even wash their hands in one; nor will they allow others to do so, as they have a great reverence for rivers. (View Highlight)\nTheir sons are carefully instructed from their fifth to their twentieth year, in three things alone, — to ride, to draw the bow, and to speak the truth. Until their fifth year they are not allowed to come into the sight of their father, but pass their lives with the women. (View Highlight)\n\nPart 3\n\nCyrus intended these words as a reproach against all the Greeks, because of their having market-places where they buy and sell, which is a custom un- known to the Persians, who never make pur- chases in open marts, and indeed have not in their whole country a single market-place. (View Highlight)\nforbid them to keep any weapons of war, command them to wear tunics under their cloaks, and to put buskins upon their legs, and make them bring up their sons to cithern-play- ing, harping, and shop-keeping. So wilt thou soon see them become women instead of men, and there will be no more fear of their revolt- ing from thee. (View Highlight)\nThese are the twelve divisions of what is now Achaea, and was formerly Ionia; and it was owing to their coming from a country so divided that the Ionians, on reaching Asia, founded their twelve States: (View Highlight)\nHence these women made a law, which they bound themselves by an oath to observe, and which they handed down to their daughters after them, “That none should ever sit at meat with her husband, or call him by his name”; because the invaders slew their fathers, their husbands, and their sons, and then forced them to become their wives. (View Highlight)\nNow the Phocaeans were the first of the Greeks who performed long voyages, and it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with the Adriatic and with Tyrrhenia, with Iberia, and the city of Tartessus. (View Highlight)\nthey were the first to fasten crests on helmets and to put devices on shields, and they also invented handles for shields. (View Highlight)\nAbove Halicarnassus, and further from the coast, were the Pedasians. With this people, when any evil is about to befall either themselves or their neighbours, the priestess of Minerva grows an ample beard. (View Highlight)\nFor the river does not, as in Egypt, overflow the corn-lands of its own accord, but is spread over them by the hand, or by the help of engines. (View Highlight)\nOnce a year in each village the maidens of age to marry were collected all together into one place; while the men stood round them in a circle. Then a herald called up the damsels one by one, and offered them for sale.\nHe began with the most beautiful. (View Highlight)\nNo one was allowed to give his daughter in marriage to the man of his choice, nor might any one carry away the damsel whom he had purchased without finding bail really and truly to make her his wife; (View Highlight)\nThey have long hair, wear turbans on their heads, and anoint their whole body with perfumes. Every one carries a seal, and a walking-stick, carved at the top into the form of an apple, a rose, a lily, an eagle, or something similar; for it is not their habit to use a stick without an ornament. (View Highlight)\nThe following custom seems to me the wisest of their institutions next to the one lately praised. They have no physicians, but when a man is ill, they lay him in the public square, and the passers-by come up to him, and if they have ever had his disease themselves or have known any one who has suffered from it, they give him advice, recommending him to do whatever they found good in their own case, or in the case known to them (View Highlight)\nThe Babylonians have one most shameful custom. Every woman born in the country must once in her life go and sit down in the precinct of Venus, and there consort with a stranger. (View Highlight)\nThe river Araxes, like the Gyndes, which (View Highlight)\nThe river Araxes, like the Gyndes, which Cyrus dispersed into three hundred and sixty channels, has its source in the country of the Matienians. It has forty mouths, whereof all, except one, end in bogs and swamps. (View Highlight)\nI live and have conquered thee in fight, and yet by thee am I ruined, for thou tookest my son with guile; but thus I make good my threat, and give thee thy fill of blood. (View Highlight)\nHuman life does not come to its natural close with this people; but when a man grows very old, all his kinsfolk collect together and offer him up in sacrifice; offering at the same time some cattle also. After the sacrifice they boil the flesh and feast on it; and those who thus end their days are reckoned the happiest.

They had unique customs, festivals, and respected their elders differently from the Greeks. Long ago, Egypt was ruled by god-kings before becoming the land shaped by the Nile river.\nURL: readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/346652941\n\nHighlights\nPart 1\n\nNow the Egyptians, before the reign of their king Psammetichus, believed themselves to be the most ancient of mankind. (View Highlight)\nconsideration of this circumstance the Egyptians yielded their claims, and admitted the greater antiquity of the Phrygians. (View Highlight)\nThe Heliopolitans have the reputation of being the best skilled in history of all the Egyptians. (View Highlight)\nThe Egyptians, they said, were the first to discover the solar year, and to portion out its course into twelve parts.. (View Highlight)\nThe Egyptians, they went on to affirm, first brought into use the names of the twelve gods, which the Greeks adopted from them; and first erected altars, images, and tem- ples to the gods; and also first engraved upon stone the figures of animals. (View Highlight)\nIn all these regions the land has been formed by rivers (View Highlight)\nthey obtain the fruits of the field with less trouble than any other people in the world, the rest of the Egyptians included, since they have no need to break up the ground with the plough, nor to use the hoe, nor to do any of the work which the rest of mankind find necessary if they are to get a crop; but the husbandman waits till the river has of its own accord spread itself over the fields and withdrawn again to its bed, and then sows his plot of ground, and after sowing turns his swine into it —the swine tread in the corn — after which he has only to await the harvest. (View Highlight)\nEgypt was the entire tract of country which the Nile overspreads and irrigates, and the Egyptians were the peo- ple who lived below Elephantine, and drank the waters of that river. (View Highlight)\nI consider Egypt to be the whole country inhabited by the Egyp- tians, just as Cilicia is the tract occupied by the Cilicians, and Assyria that possessed by the As- syrians. (View Highlight)\nArrived in Ethiopia, they placed them- selves at the disposal of the king. In return, he made them a present of a tract of land which belonged to certain Ethiopians with whom he was at feud, bidding them expel the inhabitants and take possession of their territory. (View Highlight)\nConcerning Egypt itself I shall extend my remarks to a great length, because there is no country that possesses so many wonders, nor any that has such a number of works which defy description. (View Highlight)\nThey eat their food out of doors in the streets, but retire for private pur- poses to their houses, giving as a reason that what is unseemly, but necessary, ought to be done in secret, but what has nothing unseemly about it, should be done openly. (View Highlight)\nThey practise circumcision for the sake of cleanliness, considering it better to be cleanly than comely. (View Highlight)\nterial. They bathe twice every day in cold wa- ter, and twice each night; (View Highlight)\nFish they are not allowed to eat; and beans —which none of the Egyp- tians ever sow, or eat, if they come up of their own accord, either raw or boiled —the priests will not even endure to look on, since they con- sider it an unclean kind of pulse. (View Highlight)\nand the Egyptians, one and all, venerate cows much more highly than any other animal. (View Highlight)\nThe pig is regarded among them as an un- clean animal, somuch so that if a man in passing accidentally touch a pig, he instantly hurries to the river, and plunges in with all his clothes on. (View Highlight)\nFor how can it be conceived possible that a dove should really speak with the voice of a man? (View Highlight)\n\nPart 2\n\nThe Egyptians first made it a point of religion to have no converse with women in the sacred places, and not to enter them without washing, after such converse. (View Highlight)\nEgypt, though it borders upon Libya, is not a region abounding in wild animals. (View Highlight)\nA sharp fight with clubs ensues, in which heads are commonly broken on both sides. Many, I am convinced, die of the wounds that they receive, though the Egyptians insist that no one is ever killed. (View Highlight)\nThe number of domestic animals in Egypt is very great, (View Highlight)\nIf a cat dies in a private house by a natural death, all the inmates of the house shave their eyebrows; on the death of a dog they shave the head and the whole of the body. (View Highlight)\nOf all known animals this is the one which from the smallest size grows to be the greatest: (View Highlight)\nthose who live in the corn country, devoting themselves, as they do, far more than any other people in the world, to the preservation of the memory of past actions, are the best skilled in history of any men that I have ever met. (View Highlight)\nthey have a persuasion that every disease to which men are liable is occasioned by the substances whereon they feed. (View Highlight)\nDiseases almost always attack men when they are exposed to a change, and never more than during changes of the weather. (View Highlight)\nMedicine is practised among them on a plan of separation; each physician treats a single disorder, and no more: thus the country swarms with medical practitioners, (View Highlight)\nThe Egyptians likewise discovered to which of the gods each month and day is sacred; and found out from the day of a man’s birth what he will meet with in the course of his life, and how he will end his days, and what sort of man he will be (View Highlight)\nWhen the Nile overflows, the country is converted into a sea, and nothing appears but the cities, which look like the islands in the Egean. (View Highlight)\nIn this number of generations there were eighteen Ethiopian kings, and one queen who was a native; all the rest were kings and Egyptians. (View Highlight)\nMy own conjectures were founded, first, on the fact that they are black-skinned and have woolly hair, (View Highlight)\nthe Colchians, the Egyptians, and the Ethiopians, are the only nations who have practised circumcision from the earliest times. (View Highlight)\nThe pillars which Sesostris erected in the conquered countries have for the most part disappeared; but in the part of Syria called Palestine, I myself saw them still standing, (View Highlight)\nFirst, thou didst seduce the wife of thy own -host —then, not content therewith, thou must violently excite her mind, and steal her away from her husband. (View Highlight)\nIt seems to me that Homer was ac- quainted with this story, and while discarding it, because he thought it less adapted for epic poetry (View Highlight)\nFor surely neither Priam, nor his family, could have been so infatuated as to endanger their own persons, their chil- dren, and their city, merely that Alexander might possess Helen. (View Highlight)\nBut the fact was that they had no Helen to deliver, and so they told the Greeks, but the Greeks would not believe what they said (View Highlight)\nThey were also the first to broach the opinion that the soul of man is immortal, and that, when the body dies, it en- ters into the form of an animal which is born at the moment, thence passing on from one an- imal into another, until it has circled through the forms of all the creatures which tenant the earth, the water, and the air, after which it en- ters again into a human frame, and is born anew. The whole period of the transmigration is (they say) three thousand years. (View Highlight)\n\nPart 3\n\nA hun- dred thousand men laboured constantly, and were relieved every three months by a fresh lot. It took ten years’ oppression of the people to make the causeway for the conveyance of the stones, a work not much inferior, in my judg- ment, to the pyramid itself. (View Highlight)\nthe daughter of Mycerinus re- quested her father in her dying moments to al- low her once a year to see the sun. (View Highlight)\nWhen the Delphians, in obedience to the command of the oracle, made proclamation that if any one claimed compensation for the murder of /Esop he should receive it, the per- son who at last came forward was Iadmon, grandson of the former Iadmon, and he re- ceived the compensation. (View Highlight)\n“My father and uncle,” he said, “though they shut up the temples, took no thought of the gods, and destroyed multi- tudes of men, nevertheless enjoyed a long life; I, who am pious, am to die so soon!” (View Highlight)\nNaucratis seems somehow to be the place where such women are most attractive. (View Highlight)\nWhen an Egyptian was guilty of an offence, his plan was not to punish him with death: in- stead of so doing, he sentenced him, according to the nature of his crime, to raise the ground to a greater or a less extent in the neighbour- hood of the city to which he belonged. (View Highlight)\nAfterwards, therefore, when Sanacharib, king of the Arabians 1 and Assyrians, marched his vast army into Egypt, the warriors one and all refused to come to his aid. (View Highlight)\npleted the series. When Hecataeus, in giving his genealogy, mentioned a god as his sixteenth ancestor, the priests opposed their genealogy to his, going through this list, and refusing to allow that any man was ever born of a god. (View Highlight)\nPan is exceedingly ancient, and belongs to those whom they call “the eight gods,” who existed before the rest. Hercules is one of the gods of the second order, who are known as “the twelve”; and Bacchus belongs to the gods of the third order, whom the twelve produced. (View Highlight)\nWonderful as is the Labyrinth, the work called the Lake of Mceris, which is close by the Labyrinth, is yet more astonishing. (View Highlight)\nFrom the date of the original set- tlement of these persons in Egypt, we Greeks, through our intercourse with them, have ac- quired an accurate knowledge of the several events in Egyptian history, from the reign of Psammetichus downwards; but before his time no foreigners had ever taken up their residence in that land. (View Highlight)\nA hun- dred and twenty thousand of the Egyptians, employed upon the work in the reign of Necos, lost their lives in making the excavation. (View Highlight)\nThe Egyptians are divided into seven —these are, the priests, the war- distinct classes riors, the cowherds, the swineherds, the trades- men, the interpreters, and the boatmen. (View Highlight)\nAt first his subjects looked down on him and held him in small esteem, because he had been a mere private person, and of a house of no great distinction; but after a time Amasis succeeded in reconciling them to his rule, not by severity, but by cleverness. (View Highlight)\n“Bowmen bend their bows when they wish to shoot; unbrace them when the shooting is over. Were they kept always strung they would break, and fail the archer in time of need. So it is with men. If they give themselves constantly to serious work, and never indulge awhile in pastime or sport, they lose their senses, and become mad or moody. (View Highlight)\nIt was this king Amasis who established the law that every Egyptian should appear once a year before the governor of his canton, and show his means of living; or, failing to do so, and to prove that he got an honest livelihood, should be put to death. Solon the Athenian borrowed this law from the Egyptians, and imposed it on his countrymen, who have ob- served it ever since. It is indeed an excellent custom.

\n\n\n\nThe Algorithm\n\nQuestion every requirement. Each should come with the name of the person who made it. You should never accept that a requirement came from a department, such as from “the legal department” or “the safety department.” You need to know the name of the real person who made that requirement. Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is. Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous, because people are less likely to question them. Always do so, even if the requirement came from me. Then make the requirements less dumb.\nDelete any part or process you can. You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn’t delete enough.\nSimplify and optimize. This should come after step two. A common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.\nAccelerate cycle time. Every process can be speeded up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps. In the Tesla factory, I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating processes that I later realized should have been deleted.\nAutomate. That comes last. The big mistake in Nevada and at Fremont was that I began by trying to automate every step. We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 51: Cybertruck: Tesla, 2018–2019\n\nCovers the development of Tesla’s Cybertruck\nHighlights Musk’s unconventional design decisions\n\nChapter 52: Starlink: SpaceX, 2015–2018\n\nDescribes the development of SpaceX’s satellite internet system\nHighlights the ambitious scale of the project\n\nChapter 53: Starship: SpaceX, 2018–2019\n\nCovers the development of SpaceX’s Starship rocket\nDescribes Musk’s vision for interplanetary travel\n\nChapter 55: Giga Texas: Tesla, 2020–2021\n\nDetails the construction of Tesla’s Texas factory\nHighlights innovations in manufacturing processes\n\nChapter 57: Full Throttle: SpaceX, 2020\n\nCovers SpaceX’s first crewed mission to the International Space Station\nDescribes the significance of this achievement for commercial spaceflight\n\nChapter 58: Bezos vs. Musk, Round 2: SpaceX, 2021\n\nCompares the approaches of Musk and Bezos in space exploration\nHighlights the growing rivalry between the two entrepreneurs\n\nChapter 59: Starship Surge: SpaceX, July 2021\n\nDescribes intensive efforts to develop the Starship rocket\nHighlights Musk’s hands-on involvement and demanding leadership style\n\nChapter 60: Solar Surge: Summer 2021\n\nCovers efforts to improve Tesla’s solar roof installation process\nDescribes Musk’s hands-on approach to solving problems\n\nChapter 62: Inspiration4: SpaceX, September 2021\n\nCovers SpaceX’s first all-civilian orbital mission\nDescribes the significance of this achievement for space tourism\n\nChapter 63: Raptor Shake-up: SpaceX, 2021\n\nDetails efforts to improve SpaceX’s Raptor engine\nDescribes Musk’s management style and focus on rapid innovation\n\nChapter 67: Money: 2021–2022\n\nDiscusses Musk’s approach to wealth and motivation\nHighlights his tendency to seek out challenges and drama\n\nChapter 69: Politics: 2020–2022\n\nCovers Musk’s increasing involvement in political discussions\nDescribes his approach to strategy, influenced by video games\n\nChapter 71: Bill Gates: 2022\n\nDescribes a conflict between Musk and Bill Gates over Tesla stock\nHighlights differences in their approaches to business and philanthropy\n\nChapter 73: “I made an offer”: Twitter, April 2022\n\nCovers Musk’s initial offer to buy Twitter\nDescribes his motivations for wanting to acquire the platform\n\nChapter 77: Optimus Prime: Tesla, 2021–2022\n\nDetails Tesla’s efforts to develop a humanoid robot\nDescribes Musk’s vision for the future of robotics\n\nChapter 82: The Takeover: Twitter, Thursday, October 27, 2022\n\nCovers Musk’s acquisition of Twitter\nDescribes his immediate actions upon taking control of the company\n\nChapter 83: The Three Musketeers: Twitter, October 26–30, 2022\n\nDescribes the team Musk assembled to run Twitter\nHighlights their unconventional backgrounds and approaches\n\nChapter 86: Blue Checks: Twitter, November 2–10, 2022\n\nCovers changes to Twitter’s verification system under Musk\nDescribes the chaos and controversy surrounding these changes\n\nChapter 88: Hardcore: Twitter, November 18–30, 2022\n\nDescribes Musk’s efforts to reshape Twitter’s culture and workforce\nHighlights his demanding management style\n\nChapter 89: Miracles: Neuralink, November 2022\n\nCovers developments at Musk’s neural interface company, Neuralink\nDescribes Musk’s vision for human-AI integration\n\nChapter 90: The Twitter Files: Twitter, December 2022\n\nCovers the release of internal Twitter documents about content moderation\nDescribes the controversy and debates surrounding these revelations\n\nChapter 93: AI for Cars: Tesla, 2022–2023\n\nDetails Tesla’s efforts to improve its self-driving technology\nDescribes Musk’s focus on AI and data collection\n\nChapter 94: AI for Humans: X.AI, 2023\n\nCovers Musk’s launch of a new AI company\nDescribes his concerns about AI safety and development\n\nChapter 95: The Starship Launch: SpaceX, April 2023\n\nDescribes the first launch attempt of SpaceX’s Starship rocket\nHighlights Musk’s approach to risk-taking and innovation\n"},"Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Kahneman---Thinking,-Fast-and-Slow":{"slug":"Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Kahneman---Thinking,-Fast-and-Slow","filePath":"Book Notes/Non-Fiction/Kahneman - Thinking, Fast and Slow.md","title":"Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman","links":[],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Philosophy","Psychology","Self-Help","book-notes"],"content":"Thoughts\nI read this book through a book club that I joined at my work.

TWO SELVES\nTwo selves\nLife as a story\nExperienced well-being\nThinking about life.\nQuotes\n“A happy mood loosens the control of caution and analysis over our performance: when in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative, but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.”\n“We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events.””We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.”\n“Declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.”\n“Before an issue is discussed, all members of the committee should be asked to write a very brief summary of their position. This procedure makes good use of the value of the diversity of knowledge and opinion in the group. The standard practice of open discussion gives too much weight to the opinions of those who speak early and assertively, causing others to line up behind them.”\n“The experiencing self does not have a voice. The remembering self is sometimes wrong, but it is the one that keeps score and governs what we learn from living, and it is the one that makes decisions. What we learn from the past is to maximize the qualities of our future memories, not necessarily of our future experience. This is the tyranny of the remembering self.”\n“Experts who acknowledge the full extent of their ignorance may expect to be replaced by more confident competitors, who are better able to gain the trust of clients. An unbiased appreciation of uncertainty is a cornerstone of rationality–but it is not what people and organizations want.”\n“The idea of mental energy is more than a mere metaphor. The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose.”\n“A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.”\n“Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it”\n“Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.”\n“The psychologist, Paul Rozin, an expert on disgust, observed that a single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of a bowl of cherries, but a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of cockroaches.”\n“Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.”\n“If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do.”\n“The idea that the future is unpredictable is undermined every day by the ease with which the past is explained.”\n“Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.”\n“A general “law of least effort” applies to cognitive as well as physical\nexertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the\nsame goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course\nof action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of\nskill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature.”\n“This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.”\n“I have always believed that scientific research is another domain where a form of optimism is essential to success: I have yet to meet a successful scientist who lacks the ability to exaggerate the importance of what he or she is doing, and I believe that someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare successes, the fate of most researchers.”\n“We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events.”\n“The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little.”\n“Money does not buy you happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery.”\n“we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.”\n“The world makes much less sense than you think. The coherence comes mostly from the way your mind works.”\n“You are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in general.”\n“Familiarity breeds liking.”\n“The illusion that we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future.”\n“The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?”\n“The test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact.” ,\n“acquisition of skills requires a regular environment, an adequate opportunity to practice, and rapid and unequivocal feedback about the correctness of thoughts and actions.” ,\n“People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media. Frequently mentioned topics populate the mind even as others slip away from awareness. In turn, what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently on the public’s mind. It is no accident that authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media. Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common” ,\n“We are prone to blame decision makers for good decisions that worked out badly and to give them too little credit for successful moves that appear obvious only after the fact.”\n“We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base rates, exposing ourselves to the planning fallacy. We focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others. Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore prone to an illusion of control. We focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs.”\n“Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty.”\n“The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.”"},"Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Kim---The-Unicorn-Project":{"slug":"Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Kim---The-Unicorn-Project","filePath":"Book Notes/Non-Fiction/Kim - The Unicorn Project.md","title":"The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data by Gene Kim","links":["Blog/2020/2020-12-19---The-Phoenix-Project","Book-Notes/Fiction/Goldratt---The-Goal"],"tags":["Non-Fiction","Software-Engineering","Business","Information-Technology","book-notes"],"content":"The Unicorn Project was a project that was mentioned in The Phoenix Project as an important project that people need time to work on.

(View Highlight)\nBut our presumption seeks to lord it over heaven, and in the pride of our hearts we think we are wiser than the gods.

(View Highlight)\nBut I require the whole city’s sanction also, which my mere wish will ensure; still by communicating the proposal to them I shall find the people better disposed. (View Highlight)\nfor a wretched son is he who rewards not his parents by service; for, when he hath conferred on them the best he hath, he in his turn from his own sons receives all such service as he gave to them. (View Highlight)\nFor pious toil is a fair ornament to cities, and carries with it a grace that never wastes away. (View Highlight)\nFor this city is not ruled by one man, but is free. The people rule in succession year by year, allowing no preference to wealth, but the poor man shares equally with the rich. (View Highlight)\nwhence I come, is ruled by one man only, not by the mob; none there puffs up the citizens with specious words, and for his own advantage twists them this way or that, one moment dear to them and lavish of his favours, the next a bane toall; (View Highlight)\nVerily the better sort count it no healthy sign when the worthless man obtains a reputation by beguiling with words the populace, though aforetime he was naught. (View Highlight)\nand how much better peace is for mankind than war —peace, the Muses’ chiefest friend, the foe of sorrow, whose joy is in glad throngs of children, and its delight in prosperity. (View Highlight)\nBut when the laws are written down, rich and poor alike have equal justice, and it is open to the weaker to use the same language to the prosperous when he is reviled by him, and the weaker prevails over the stronger if he have justice on his side. (View Highlight)\nwhere the people are absolute rulers of the land, they rejoice in having a reserve of youthful citizens, while a king counts this a hostile element, and strives to slay the leading men, all such as he deems discreet, for he feareth for his power. (View Highlight)\nMay my life end if ever my children are to be wedded by violence! (View Highlight)\nLet the dead now be buried in the earth, and each element return to the place from whence it\ncame to the body, the breath to the air, the body to the ground; for in no wise did we get it for our own, but to live our life in, and after that its mother earth must take it back again. (View Highlight)\nFortune lives a dainty life; to her the wretched pays his court and homage to win her smile; her likewise doth the prosperous man extol, for fear the favouring gale may leave him. (View Highlight)\nMethinks I should not have suffered excessively, had I never borne the marriage- yoke; but now I have my sorrow full in view, the loss of children dear.

It is in GB Volume 5. The newsletter post is here.\nNotes\nPage 1: Lines 1 - 69:\n\nThe play opens with a scene outside Ajax’s tent in the Greek camp near Troy. Ulysses (Odysseus) is examining footprints, and Athena appears above him.\nAthena complements him for his keen observation. Ulysses recognizes Athena and thanks her.\nHe says the cattle they had captured as spoils of war were found slaughtered and many suspect Ajax.\nAthena confirms that Ajax indeed killed the cattle thinking that they were Greek leaders. He had set out to kill the chiefs but Athena caused him to hallucinate.\n\n\nUlysses: “thine is the hand that ever guides my course—as in the past, so for the days to come.”\n\nPage 2: Lines 69 - 181:\n\nAthena calls Ajax out of his tent. She assures Ulysses that Ajax will not be able to see him.\nAjax emerges, still delusional, believing he has captured and killed the Greek leaders. He thinks he has Ulysses still captured in his tent and is planning to torture him.\nAfter Ajax goes back Ulysses expresses pity for Ajax, reflecting on the fragility of human life.\nAthena warns against arrogance and says “the wise of heart are loved of the gods”.\nThe Chorus (Ajax’s friends) enters expressing concern for Ajax since they heard the rumor about Ajax killing the cattle. They criticize those who spread malicious gossip since they don’t believe the rumor. They also say that if Ajax did something, it might have been the work of the gods - Artemis or Ares (Lord of War).\n\n\nAthena: “For a day can humble all human things, and a day can lift them up; but the wise of heart are loved of the gods, and the evil are abhorred.”\n\nPage 3: Lines 182 - 313:\n\nThe Chorus asks Ajax to come out and clear the issue of the rumor saying that he would not have done the deed on his own account.\nTecmessa enters addressing the Chorus as ‘Mariners of Ajax’. So, they are the sailors who sailed with Ajax. The Chorus addresses her as ‘spear-won bride’. So, she is Ajax’s concubine who he probably took up during the war.\nShe confirms that Ajax has indeed gone mad and gives details about how he killed cattle and the guards in the night. The Chorus gets scared and contemplates whether they should flee for they might be killed by stoning or in other ways.\nShe says that Ajax has regained his sanity but is in deep distress over what he had done.\n\n\nTecmessa: “To look on self-wrought woes, when no other hath had a hand therein—this lays sharp pangs to the soul.”\n\nPage 4: Lines 314 - 441:\n\nTecmessa continues to talk about Ajax’s despair and they hear Ajax’ cry from the tent calling for Teucer.\nThey go in and find Ajax sitting among the slaughtered animals. He sees them and talks to them about his sad state and shame.\nHe expresses his desire to die and his anger towards Ulysses and the Greek leaders. He says his past achievements are meaningless. He feels that he has not lived up to his father Telamon.\n\n\nChorus: “cure not ill by ill, nor in- crease the anguish of the doom.”\n\nPage 5: Lines 442 - 555:\n\nAjax continues to lament, feels cheated of honor, blames Athena and thinks what he should do next.\nTecmessa pleads with Ajax not to abandon her and their son, who might have a dreadful fate if Ajax dies. She says Ajax had sacked their country and killed her parents and has no where to go.\nAjax asks to see his son Eurysaces. When he comes, Ajax reflects on his son’s innocence and hopes for a bright future for him.\n\n\nAjax: “‘Tis base for a man to crave the full term of life, who finds no varying in his woes. What joy is there in day following day—now pushing us forward, now drawing us back, on the verge—of death?”\n\nPage 6: Lines 555 - 681:\n\nAjax tells his son that Teucer will take care of him. He says his shield should go to his son and the rest of his armor should be buried with him.\nHe asks Tecmessa to go inside with the kid and then goes inside and comes out with a sword.\nHe says he wants to go to the shore to purify himself and bury the sword, which was a gift from Hector. But though Hector gave it in good faith, Ajax now feels it brought him bad luck.\nHe says he will yield to the gods and revere and submit to the Atreidae since they are the rules.\n\n\nAjax: “For since my hand took this gift from Hector, my worst foe, to this hour I have had no good from the Greeks.”\n\nPage 7: Lines 681 - 800:\n\nAfter Ajax goes to the shore to purify himself, the Chorus is happy with the change of his mindset.\nA messenger arrives saying that Teucer is being threatened by the Greeks calling him ” kinsman of the maniac, of the plotter against the host”.\nThe messenger tells them that Calchas the prophet told Teucer to make sure to keep Ajax inside his tent. Otherwise there might be risk to his life.\nThe Chorus says it is already too late since Ajax left his tent. Tecmessa is alarmed by this news.\n\n\nCalchas: “lives that have waxed too proud, and avail for good no more, are struck down by heavy misfortunes from the gods.”\n\nPage 8: Lines 801 - 923:\n\nTecmessa frantically asks people to go in search of Ajax.\nMeanwhile Ajax is on the seashore, planting Hector’s sword on the ground. He calls on Zeus and Hermes to give him a quick death, asks the Furies for revenge against the Atreidae,\nAfter bidding farewell to Salamis, Athens and Troy, he falls on his sword and dies.\nThe Chorus is still looking for Ajax. They hear Tecmessa crying out and when the reach they find Ajax head and Tecmessa explains that he committed suicide.\n\n\nAjax: “I call also on Hermes, guide to the nether world, that he lay me softly asleep, without a struggle, at one quick bound,”\n\nThis was a shocking sudden turn of events. I flipped the pages to see if the play was over!\nPage 9: Lines 924 - 1038:\n\nThe Chorus and Tecmessa lament Ajax’s fate. Tecmessa says the Greek leaders will regret losing Ajax.\nTeucer arrives and asks about Ajax. When he is told of the death, he seeks to see the body. When he sees the body, he laments his death. He wonders how he will go back and face Telamon.\n\n\nTecmessa: “Ill- judging men know not the good that was in their hands, till they have lost it.”\n\nPage 10: Lines 1038 - 1140:\n\nMenelaus enters and forbids the burial of Ajax’s body. He says Ajax was a traitor who attempted to kill the Greek leaders. He says if there is license to insult and act at will, that State will always fail. He says if anyone tries to bury Ajax, they will also need a grave.\nTeucer questions Menelaus’ authority. He says he came as Sparta’s king and not their king.\nThey get into a heated argument.\n\n\nMenelaus: “where there is licence to insult and act at will, doubt not that such a State, though favouring gales have sped her, some day, at last, sinks into the depths.”\n\nPage 11: Lines 1141 - 1262:\n\nMenelaus &amp; Teucer continue their argument with each not giving in. Finally Menelaus leaves.\nTecmessa and Eurysaces (Ajax’s son) enter and Teucer tells Eurysaces to stay next to his father as a suppliant. He asks everyone else to guard the body while he goes to prepare the grave.\n\n\nHe tells Tecmessa and the Chorus to guard the body while he goes to prepare the grave. After he leaves, the Chorus laments the long years of war and hardship at Troy.\nTeucer returns and Agamemnon comes there after that. He criticizes Teucer of arrogance and calls him son of a captive woman. He threatens Teucer with punishment if he buries Ajax.\n\n\nAgamemnon: “‘Tis not the burly, broad-shouldered men that are surest at need; no, ‘tis the wise who prevail in every field. A large-ribbed ox is yet kept straight on the road by a small whip.”\n\nPage 12: Lines 1262 - 1363:\n\nTeucer reminds Agamemnon of Ajax’s heroic deeds during the war, that Ajax had saved them when their ships were burning and had single handedly fought Hector.\nTeucer says though his mother was captive, she was a queen before. Both his parents were noble but Agamenon’s were not. He also talks about Atreus’ horrific deed of feeding his brother after killing his children. Teucer vows to die fighting if the burial is not allowed.\nUlysses enters and Agamemnon explains the situation to him saying Ajax is a traitor who tried to kill them. Ulysses argues that denying burial, especially to a brave man like Ajax, would not be the right thing. He says Ajax’ worth weighs far more than his enmity.\n\n\nUlysses: “When a brave man is dead, ‘tis not right to do him scathe no, not even if thou hate him.”\n\nPage 13: Lines 1364 - 1421:\n\nAgamemnon reluctantly agrees to allow Ajax’s burial. Ulysses offers to help. Teucer praises Ulysses’ support but politely declines his offer.\nTeucer gives instructions to the burial and they get started with the procedure.\n\n\nChorus: “Many things shall mortals learn by seeing; but, before he sees, no man may read the future, or his fate.”\n"},"Book-Notes/Plays/Sophocles---Antigone":{"slug":"Book-Notes/Plays/Sophocles---Antigone","filePath":"Book Notes/Plays/Sophocles - Antigone.md","title":"Antigone by Sophocles","links":["General-Notes/People/Authors/Sophocles","General-Notes/Books-Reference/Great-Books-of-the-Western-World/GB-Volume-5"],"tags":["Classics","Great-Books","Fiction","Play","book-notes"],"content":"This is a play by Sophocles. It is in GB Volume 5. My newsletter post is here.\nNotes\nPage 1: Lines 1 - 85:\nThe play starts with Antigone talking to her sister Ismene alone. She says no one has had so much ruin, shame, and dishonor like them. She asks if Ismene has heard about the new edict from Creon, their uncle and the king of Thebes. Ismene is unaware of any news after their brothers died fighting each other, and the Argives who supported Polyneices fled. Antigone reveals that Creon has decreed that Eteocles will receive an honorable burial, while Polyneices will be left unwept, untombed, and as a welcome store for the birds to feast on at will. Antigone is outraged by this and resolves to bury Polyneices, saying she’d rather die doing what’s right. She asks for her sister’s help, but Ismene says that they should not defy the law or fight with men. Antigone decides to go forward without Ismene’s help.\n\nIsmene: “Nay, we must remember, first, that we were born women, as who should not strive with men;”\n\nPage 2: Lines 86 - 210:\nAntigone criticizes Ismene’s silence and refusal to help and says she is determined to honor their brother, even if it means her death. Ismene says her errand is foolish but she still loves her. The Chorus welcomes the dawn and recounts how Zeus helped defeat the enemy army, their seven warriors and their boastful leader. Creon enters and says how he has come to power since he is the nearest kin to the dead king and his sons. He says his only goal, with Zeus as his witness, is to ensure the safety and welfare of his citizens. He says that he will always honor those loyal to Thebes and punish its enemies. Since Polyneices sought to destroy Thebes, set fire to the land and enslave people, he will be left unburied as a traitor.\n\nCreon: “No man can be fully known, in soul and spirit and mind, until he hath been seen versed in rule and lawgiving.”\n\nPage 3: Lines 211 - 325:\nAs Creon is talking to the Chorus, a guard approaches and says someone has performed burial rites for Polyneices’ body. He says there is dust covering the corpse, and no one knows who did it. The guards even argued among themselves accusing each other of helping someone with the burial. Creon is upset and angry that someone has defied him and demands that the offender be found.\n\nCreon: “Nothing so evil as money ever grew to be current among men. This lays cities low, this drives men from their homes, this trains and warps honest souls till they set themselves to works of shame;”\n\nPage 4: Lines 325 - 448:\nThe guard exits, and the Chorus sings the praise of humanity - saying humans have tamed everything on earth, learned things on their own, and found solutions to all things except death. The guard returns with Antigone as a prisoner. Creon comes in, and the guard tells him that they saw Antigone performing burial rites for the corpse when the dust storm cleared. Creon asks Antigone if she knew about his edict forbidding the burial. She says yes, it was public, everyone knew.\n\nChorus: “Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man; the power that crosses the white sea, driven by the stormy south-wind, making a path under surges that threaten to engulf him.”\n\nPage 5: Lines 449 - 551:\nAntigone says Creon’s edict doesn’t override divine laws that are eternal. Creon sees Antigone as insolent and stubborn and declares that she should be punished regardless of her being his niece. Ismene arrives, crying. Creon accuses her of being involved in the burial as well. She says yes and wants to share the blame with her sister. Antigone refuses, saying only Hades and the dead were witnesses, and Ismene has no share in it.\n\nAntigone: “For their life is not of today or yesterday, but from all time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.”\n\nPage 6: Lines 552 - 669:\nIsmene again asks her sister how she could help, and Antigone says she alone must bear the consequences of the actions. Creon dismisses both of them as foolish. Ismene reminds Creon that Antigone is betrothed to his son, Haemon and if he would still slay her. Creon says his son can find another wife than Antigone. Haemon enters and says that he looks up to his father’s guidance for everything, including marriage. Creon talks about the importance of obedience to paternal and state authority. He asks him to let Antigone go to find a husband in the house of Hades (death). He plans to slay her for her open disobedience.\n\nChorus: “Blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. For when a house hath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore, passing from life to life of the race;”\n\nPage 7: Lines 669 - 776:\nCreon talks about the importance of obedience and order in society, saying that disobedience is the worst of evils, ruining cities and homes. Haemon tries to reason with his father saying he is wise but should also be flexible and open to other perspectives. He says the citizens of Thebes sympathize with Antigone. He talks about the value of adaptability citing examples of trees bending in a storm and sailors adjusting their sails. But Creon doesn’t see Haemon’s viewpoint and an argument ensues. Creon accuses his son of siding with a woman. Haemon accuses his father of disrespecting the gods. Creon orders Antigone to be brought for execution. Haemon leaves in anger, declaring he won’t see his father again. Instead of executing, Creon decides to entomb Antigone in a cave with minimal food so that the city may avoid public stain.\n\nCreon: “But disobedience is the worst of evils. This it is that ruins cities; this makes homes desolate; by this, the ranks of allies are broken into headlong rout;”\n\nPage 8: Lines 776 - 916:\nThe Chorus describes love as an unconquerable force that affects all beings and says love makes people mad. Antigone mourns her fate as she’s led to her death. She addresses her hometown and its landmarks. She reflects on her family’s tragic history, justifies her actions in burying her brother and looks forward to joining her family in the afterlife. Creon comes in and orders an end to the lamentations, and get started with the entombment.\n\nChorus: “Love, unconquered in the fight, Love, who makest havoc of wealth, who keepest thy vigil on the soft cheek of a maiden; thou roamest over the sea, and among the homes of dwellers in the wilds; no immortal can escape thee, nor any among men whose life is for a day; and he to whom thou hast come is mad.”\n\nPage 9: Lines 916 - 1037:\nAntigone, now sad that she is going to die, wonders if she has truly sinned against the gods. She says it would be wrongful if the gods were to judge against her. The blind prophet Teiresias arrives and tells Creon that he has seen disturbing omens, saying that gods are displeased and no longer accept the city’s prayers or sacrifices. He warns Creon against stubbornness and pride and urges him to allow Polyneices to be buried. Creon gets upset and accuses Teiresias of being corrupt.\n\nChorus: “But dreadful is the mysterious power of fate; there is no deliverance from it by wealth or by war, by fenced city, or dark, sea-beaten ships.”\n\nPage 10: Lines 1037 - 1157:\nSince Creon refuses to listen to his advice, Teiresias warns that he will be punished, that the Furies will bring destruction, that Creon might lose a child, and that other cities will turn against Thebes. The Chorus urges Creon to heed Teiresias’s warnings. Creon finally relents and agrees to free Antigone and bury Polyneices himself. The Chorus prays for deliverance from the current crisis.\n\nCreon: “My heart misgives me, ‘tis best to keep the established laws, even to life’s end.”\n\nPage 11: Lines 1157 - 1267:\nA messenger comes in and announces that Haemon has killed himself. Eurydice, Creon’s wife enters and asks for details. The messenger says when Creon went to bury Polyneices, they heard a wailing from Antigone’s tomb. They rush towards the tomb to find that Antigone has hanged herself and Haemon embracing her body. When Haemon sees his father, he blames him for his fiancé’s death and kills himself. Eurydice, shaken by the news, leaves silently. Creon enters, carrying Haemon’s body, and laments his own actions.\n\nMessenger: “Fortune raises and Fortune humbles the lucky or unlucky from day to day, and no one can prophesy to men concerning those things which are established.”\n\nPage 12: Lines 1268 - 1353:\nCreon mourns his son Haemon’s death, acknowledging his own fault saying he has learned his lesson too late. A messenger arrives and says Eurydice has killed herself after learning of Haemon’s death. Creon is further saddened and blames himself for the loss of both his wife and son. He wishes for his own death. The Chorus emphasizes the importance of wisdom and reverence for the gods.\n\nChorus: “Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness; and reverence towards the gods must be inviolate.”\n"},"Book-Notes/Plays/Sophocles---Electra":{"slug":"Book-Notes/Plays/Sophocles---Electra","filePath":"Book Notes/Plays/Sophocles - Electra.md","title":"Electra by Sophocles","links":["General-Notes/People/Authors/Sophocles","General-Notes/Books-Reference/Great-Books-of-the-Western-World/GB-Volume-5","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Paedagogus","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Orestes","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Agamemnon","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Pylades","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Aegisthus","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Chrysothemis","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Clytaemnestra"],"tags":["Fiction","Play","Classics","Great-Books","book-notes"],"content":"This is a play by Sophocles.

Once inside they could get revenge. As they talk, they hear Electra’s cries from inside.\n\nPage2:  Lines 82 - 239:\n\nElectra addresses the sunlight and air, lamenting her father’s death and her constant grief.\nShe blames her mother and Aegisthus for her sorrow.\nThe Chorus tries to console her saying her sorrow cannot bring back her father from the dead.\nElectra calls for divine retribution but the Chorus asks her to rein in her words.\n\nPage 3: Lines 239 - 366:\n\nElectra says that her mother mistreats her. She is waiting for her brother Orestes to return and take revenge.\nChrysothemis, Electra’s sister, enters. She criticizes Electra for her public displays of grief and advises her to be more prudent and obey the current rulers.\nElectra is upset with her sister’s attitude, accuses Chrysothemis of forgetting their father and only thinking of their mother.\n\nPage 4: Lines 366 - 478:\n\nThe argument between the sisters continue. Chrysothemis warns Electra that if she continues her defiance, their mother and Aegisthus might imprison her in a dungeon. Electra doesn’t care though.\nChrysothemis says she’s been sent by their mother to take funeral offerings to their father’s tomb. Electra is surprised and asks why. Her sister that it is due to a dream that their mother saw.\nElectra tells her sister to not do the offerings but just offer a lock of their hair and pray to their father for help. Chrysothemis goes out to do this.\n\nPage 5: Lines 478 - 614:\n\nThe Chorus says Agamemnon will get justice and talk about the cursed history of the house.\nClytaemnestra enters and scolds Electra, accusing her of shaming the family by her public lamentations. She then defends her murder of her husband saying it was justice for her daughter Iphigenia, that Agamemnon should have let Menelaus sacrifice his daughter.\nElectra responds pointing our holes in her mother’s logic. Agamemnon had to sacrifice his daughter because Artemis was angry with him due to something he had done in the past (he had shot and killed a stag in the grove of the goddess). Electra says her mother killed her father because of her affair with Aegisthus and that she should be shameful for having kids with him.\nClytaemnestra is angered and wonders how she could deal with a daughter who insults her in the open.\n\nPage 6: Lines 614 - 735:\n\nClytaemnestra threatens her daughter with punishment when Aegisthus returns. She then prays to Apollo for protection of her current status and relationships.\nPaedagogus enters and says that Orestes is dead. This causes Electra great distress.\nWhen Clytaemnestra asks for more details the elderly man describes the chariot race that Orestes was on and how the accident happened. He makes the description vivid and believable.\n\nPage 7: Lines 735 - 853:\n\nClytaemnestra is sad at the new but also is relieved that no one is going to come to seek revenge on her.\nElectra is in utter despair, expresses her anger at her mother’s lack of remorse, and laments the loss of hope of Orestes coming back and getting justice for their father.\nThe Chorus sympathizes with Electra.\n\nPage 8: Lines 854 - 968:\n\nChrysothemis enters and excitedly tells the news that Orestes is alive based on her discovering a lock of hair similar to hers on the tomb of their father Agamemnon.\nElectra tells Chrysothemis of the messenger’s report of Orestes’ death and this confuses her sister.\nShe says, now that Orestes is dead, it is upon them to seek justice. She suggests that they must take up arms and kill Aegisthus, their father’s murderer. They have nothing to lose anyways since they are living like slaves.\n\nPage 9: Lines 968 - 1076:\n\nChrysothemis is shocked by her sister urging her to join in the plot to kill their step father. She says Electra’s plan is foolish. They are just women and are weaker than men.\nBoth sisters continue arguing about justice, wisdom, and right action. Chrysothemis decides to not help Electra with her plan.\nThe Chorus laments about Electra’s lonely struggle and grief.\n\nPage 10: Lines 1077 - 1188:\n\nOrestes and Pylades enter, claiming to be messengers saying they have news of Orestes’ death and have his ashes in an urn.\nElectra is even more saddened by this and recalls her childhood with her brother.\nOrestes is deeply moved by her words.\n\nPage 11: Lines 1189 - 1291:\n\nSeeing Electra’s deep despair and sadness, Orestes reveals himself to her saying the ashes are not real.\nElectra is overjoyed but Orestes urges caution to avoid alerting others.

As she is describing the place, a stranger arrives and and tells them that they’re on sacred ground that shouldn’t be trodden upon.\nThe place is dedicated to Eumenides, the daughters of Earth and Darkness. (From reading Aeschylus’ Eumenides, we know that they are the Furies, the goddesses of vengeance.) He also mentions that the area is sacred to Poseidon and Prometheus.\nThe stranger says that the king of the place and surrounding is Theseus. Oedipus asks to see Theseus.\n\nPage 2 (Lines 72 - 193)\n\n\nThe stranger leaves, and Oedipus prays to the gods asking for their grace since he believes that he found the prophesied final resting place.\n\n\nA group of elders (chorus) enters and asks Oedipus to move away from the sacred place and sit in a corner. Then they ask him about his origins.\n\n\nPage 3 (Lines 194 - 305)\n\n\nAfter Oedipus tells his story, they are alarmed and want this cursed person to leave their land as soon as possible.\n\n\nAntigone appeals to the Chorus for compassion, emphasizing that her father’s crimes were unintentional.\n\n\nOedipus also says that his crimes were fated and not done by him, and he questions the value of Athens’ reputation for hospitality if they reject him.\n\n\nPage 4 (Lines 305 - 409)\n\n\nIsmene (Oedipus’ second daughter) arrives and Oedipus and Antigone are overjoyed to see her.\n\n\nIsmene tells them about the conflict between Oedipus’ sons, Eteocles and Polyneices. She says Eteocles has seized the throne, expelling Polyneices.\n\n\nShe says that an Oracle has told Creon that if Oedipus is in Thebes (regardless of alive or dead), they will have victory. The people of Thebes want Oedipus near their land but not within their borders since they think he is cursed.\n\n\nPage 5 (Lines 410 - 512)\n\n\nOedipus is upset and angry that people are going to be seeking him to get the throne and not because they care for him.\n\n\nLooks like after Oedipus had exiled himself after his mother/wife’s death and his blindness, he wanted to go back and at that time, the city exiled him and his sons did not help. Oedipus declares that he will never help Thebes or his sons.\n\n\nThe Chorus suggests that Oedipus make atonement to Eumenides and give instructions on the ritual. Since he is blind, Isemene performs the ritual and leaves.\n\n\nPage 6 (Lines 513 - 603)\n\n\nOedipus goes into detail about his past as the chorus is eager to know more.\n\n\nTheseus, the king of Athens, arrives. He is sympathetic to Oedipus and offers him support and protection.\n\n\nOedipus thanks him and says that the city will benefit even after he is dead. He says that his sons had refused him when he was willing to return and now will come to seek his help to get the throne.\n\n\nPage 7 (Lines 604 - 722)\n\n\nOedipus prophesies that Athens will benefit from him being buried there. Theseus accepts Oedipus as a citizen of Athens and offers him the option of staying where he is or come to his home.\n\n\nOedipus decides to stay at the grove. Theseus leaves and the chorus sings praises of Colonus and Athens.\n\n\nPage 8 (Lines 723 - 828)\n\n\nCreon arrives and appeals to Oedipus to return to Thebes, citing kinship and pity. Oedipus rejects him outright.\n\n\nThey exchange sharp words. Creon says they have already taken Isemene and orders his guards to seize Antigone. Oedipus is shocked. The chorus demands Creon to leave.\n\n\nPage 9 (Lines 829 - 919)\n\n\nAs Antigone is dragged away, Creon threatens to take Oedipus also captive.\n\n\nTheseus arrives and immediately takes action, sending men to rescue the daughters. He criticizes Creon for disrespecting Athens and its laws.\n\n\nPage 10 (Lines 920 - 1040)\n\n\nCreon says he didn’t think that Athens was providing refuge to Oedipus. He says Oedipus is cursed by the gods and no one would give him refuge.\n\n\nOedipus says that everything in his life was fated by the gods and his crimes committed in ignorance. But Creon’s crimes are not so.\n\n\nTheseus stands by his word to protect Oedipus and orders Creon to return the maidens.\n\n\nPage 11 (Lines 1040 - 1163)\n\n\nTheseus leaves with Creon and returns with Antigone and Ismene.\n\n\nOedipus is overjoyed to see his daughters back and thanks Theseus and praises him.\n\n\nDuring this time, they are informed of a new suppliant at Poseidon’s altar.\n\n\nPage 12 (Lines 1164 - 1281)\n\n\nThe new suppliant is Polyneices, Oedipus’s son, who is reluctant to come to Oedipus, knowing that his father doesn’t want to see him.\n\n\nAntigone urges Oedipus to meet with Polyneices, emphasizing forgiveness and duty.\n\n\nOedipus agrees and Polyneices comes in laments his family’s fate, says sorry for his past faults and asks for mercy.\n\n\nPage 13 (Lines 1281 - 1409)\n\n\nPolyneices explains how he was exiled by his brother and how the plans to attack Thebes with the support of Argos and talks about the great warriors on his side. He says he can win the battle with Oedipus’s blessing.\n\n\nOedipus curses Polyneices, saying he will never conquer Thebes. He prophesies that he will get killed by his brother and vice versa.\n\n\nThe chorus asks Polyneices, and he starts to leave in sadness, lamenting his failure and thinking about the doom that awaits him.\n\n\nPage 14 (Lines 1409 - 1515)\n\n\nAs he leaves, Polyneices asks his sisters to give him a proper burial. Antigone begs him to abandon the plans to attack Thebes, but Polyneices says honor is above life and leaves.\n\n\nEveryone hears thunder and sees lightning, and Oedipus says that his time has come and asks to summon Theseus.\n\n\nPage 15 (Lines 1516 - 1634)\n\n\nOedipus tells Theseus that the location of his death has to be kept a secret.\n\n\nThey all leave and a messenger comes back to tell the audience that Oedipus has died and gives details about his final moments. He says Oedipus prepared for his death by washing and dressing, then comforted his daughters. A god’s voice was heard - “Oedipus, Oedipus, why delay we to go? Thou tarriest too long.”\n\n\nPage 16 (Lines 1634 - 1779)\n\n\nThe messenger continues recounting the final moments. After Oedipus asks Theseus to swear to protect his daughters, he bids a tearful farewell to his daughters.\n\n\nThe messenger says that Oedipus vanished mysteriously, and when they looked back, they saw only the king.\n\n\nThe daughters mourn their father’s death. Antigone asks to see Oedipus’ tomb, but Theseus refuses. The sisters then ask to be sent back to Thebes, and Theseus agrees.\n\n"},"Book-Notes/Plays/Sophocles---Philoctetes":{"slug":"Book-Notes/Plays/Sophocles---Philoctetes","filePath":"Book Notes/Plays/Sophocles - Philoctetes.md","title":"Philoctetes by Sophocles","links":["General-Notes/People/Authors/Sophocles","General-Notes/Books-Reference/Great-Books-of-the-Western-World/GB-Volume-5","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Odysseus","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Neoptolemus","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Philoctetes","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Heracles","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Achilles","General-Notes/People/Fictional-Characters/Diomedes"],"tags":["Fiction","Play","Classics","Great-Books","book-notes"],"content":"This is a play by Sophocles.

He says he was brought into the war after his father Achilles was dead. He has been mistreated by the leaders and is angry with them and is going back.\nPhiloctetes is moved by Neoptolemus’ plight and asks of others that he knew about like Nestor.

He also says that Odysseus and Diomedes are in pursuit of someone. He wants to take Neoptolemus to a side and say something. But he says it can be said in the open.\nThen the merchant says that Odysseus is in pursuit of Philoctetes. He says that the seer Helenus whom the Greek had taken prisoner prophesied that unless they bring Philoctetes from the island to Troy, the Greeks could never win the war.\nPhiloctetes is dismayed at this. He says they would come to persuade him and take him and after their use, they would kill him.

She says her life has been full of misery and suffering since the beginning.\nWhen she was a maiden, her suitor was a god/monster who changed into 3 different forms - a bull, a serpent and a man with an ox’s head. Luckily for her, Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmena, fought this god and defeated him and won her hand.\nBut life with Heracles has not been easy since he goes on voyages for long periods of time and she is left anxious at home wondering if he would come back or not.\nCurrently, he has been gone longer than the past and they are in exile in Trachis after Heracles killed Iphitus. She is worried if he is dead.\nHer nurse asks her to send her son Hyllus to get news. Hyllus enters and when his mother tells him about a prophesy that Heracles might die or find peace after this last task. He tells her that he will go.\n\nPage 2: Lines 90 - 212:\n\nHyllus leaves to seek news of his father. Chorus enters and tells Deianeira that her worrying in excessive. Zeus has not given a painless life to mortals. Everyone suffers. Joy and sorrow comes to all in cycles.\nDeianeira says that her excessive worry this time is because before Heracles left he gave her a tablet and instruction on how to divide his property among his sons. It was as if he knew that he might die this time.\nAs they are talking, a messenger arrives with news that Heracles is alive and victorious. He says he heard it from Lichas, Heracles’ herald who is also on his way but is slower since many are eager to hear from him. The Chorus &amp; Deianeira rejoice after hearing this news.\n\nPage 3: Lines 213 - 327:\n\nLichas arrives with captive maidens, and confirms that Heracles is alive and well and is performing sacrificial rites to Zeus.\nHe says that the captured women are from the city of Eurytus, which Heracles conquered, which Heracles conquered.\nHe then talks about why Heracles attacked Eurytus and why he was away for so long. Heracles was insulted by Eurytus at a banquet and thrown out and enslaved in a place named Lydia. He also says the enslavement was a punishment by Zeus for killing Iphitus by guile. While held captive, Heracles had vowed to take revenge on Eurytus.\nDeianeira notices one of captive girls who seems particularly noble (Iole) and asks Lichas about her. He claims he doesn’t know anything about her.\n\nPage 4: Lines 327 - 430:\n\nOnce the maidens and Lichas enter the house, the messenger stops Deianeira, saying he wants to talk to her privately.\nThe messenger says Lichas has not been truthful. He says Iole is the daughter of Eurytus and Heracles attacked Eurytus and conquered the city of Oechalia because he was in love with Iole and her father had refused to give her to him.\nDeianeira is shocked to hear this and questions Lichas when he returns. Lichas denies and sticks to his story. The messenger accuses Lichas of lying.\n\nPage 5: Lines 431 - 556:\n\nDeianeira tells Lichas that Heracles has done infidelity in the past and she wants to know if this is true or not. She doesn’t blame Heracles since falling in love is god’s doing and not in human hands.\nLichas admits to lying to protect Deianeira’s feelings and says Heracles did conquer the city because of his love for Iole.\nDeianeira goes inside worried about losing Heracles to the younger woman and thinking of how to win him back.\n\nPage 6: Lines 556 - 667:\n\nDeianeira’s gift to Heracles is a robe. She has put centaur Nessus’ blood on this rope with the hope that it will get Heracles back to her.\nBackstory - Heracles had shot Nessus with an arrow when he tried to misbehave with her. As he was dying, he gave his blood to Deianeira saying that it would be a love charm for Heracles’ soul and he wouldn’t look at any other woman.\nWhen Lichas returns, Deianeira gives him the robe and says that he should give it give it only to Heracles and no one else.\n\nPage 7: Lines 668 - 781:\n\nDeianeira is anxious whether she did the right thing or not by sending the robe with the love charm in it. When the wool she used to apply the blood to the robe shriveled and crumbled into powder when exposed to sunlight, she realizes that the blood was probably destructive and not a love charm.\nThe Chorus tries to calm her down but she continues to be in despair.\nHer worst fears come true when her son Hyllus returns and says that Heracles has been poisoned by the robe that she gave. While in intense pain, he asked Lichas about the gift and he said it was given by his wife. He grabbed Lichas by his foot and smashed him on a rock in rage.\n\nPage 8: Lines 781 - 892:\n\nHyllus says they have brought Heracles back and he might be dying. Deianeira is shocked to hear all this and goes away silently.\nThe Chorus reflects on an old prophesy about Heracles - about his tasks ending after 12 years. They say Deianeira did what she did unknowingly.\nA Nurse comes in and says that Deianeira killed herself.\n\nPage 9: Lines 893 - 1017:\n\nHyllus hears of his mother’s death and is totally sad that his unkind words led his mother to commit suicide.\nHeracles is brought in and is in intense pain. He asks for someone to end his life. He says he feels betrayed by those he helped in the past.\n\nPage 10: Lines 1018 - 1137:\n\nHeracles recounts his past heroic deeds:\n\nDefeating the Nemean Lion\nSlaying the Lernaean Hydra\nOvercoming the Centaurs\nKilling the Erymanthian Boar\nCapturing Cerberus\nGuarding the golden apples of the Hesperides\n\n\n\n\nHe vows vengeance on Deianeira for bringing him to this state to despair.\nHyllus tries to explain that his mother was trying to do a good thing but it went back. Heracles refuses to listen since he is in pain and his mind is full on anger.\n\nPage 11: Lines 1138 - 1240:\n\nHeracles finally understands that he was poisoned by the love charm which was Nessus the centaur’s blood. He remembers that prophesy that he would be killed by someone who is already dead.\nHeracles asks his son to promise him in the name of Zeus that he will do as he says.

The notes on Substack and the responses to the notes have been pretty intriguing and I’ve felt compelled to join in many times. But the ‘slow reading’ is much faster than my reading of two page per day of the Great Books of the Western World. I’m also reading other books in parallel. So, hope to join sometime in the future or follow the reading schedule on my own.\nWas surprised to see this in the NYT Top 100 Books of the 21st Century as #3. Happened to go to a second-hand bookstore nearby on the day I read the NYT article and found this displayed on a mantle at the start of one of the aisles. So now, I have a copy of my own.\nThomas Cromwell reminds me of watching The Tudors on Neftlix long back. Both of us enjoyed it. Henry Cavill’s Duke of Suffolk was my favorite character.

Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?\nWhen you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor—your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money, Is this what you consider evil?\nHave you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions—and you’ll learn that man’s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.\nBut you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made—before it can be looted or mooched—made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can’t consume more than he has produced.\nTo trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss—the recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your misery—that you must offer them values, not wounds—that the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men’s stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by trade—with reason, not force, as their final arbiter—it is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest ability—and the degree of a man’s productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider evil?\nBut money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality—the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind.\nMoney will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if he’s evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if he’s evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his money. Is this the reason why you call it evil?\nOnly the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth—the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil?\nMoney is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your money by fraud? By pandering to men’s vices or men’s stupidity? By catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your money will not give you a moment’s or a penny’s worth of joy. Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then you’ll scream that money is evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of money?\nMoney will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Money is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money?\nOr did you say it’s the love of money that’s the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. It’s the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money—and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.\nLet me give you a tip on a clue to men’s characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.\nRun for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper’s bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another—their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.\nBut money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich—will not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guilt—and of his life, as he deserves.\nThen you will see the rise of the men of the double standard—the men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money—the men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-law—men who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victims—then money becomes its creators’ avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they’ve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.\nDo you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a society’s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion—when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing—when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors—when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don’t protect you against them, but protect them against you—when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice—you may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that is does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.\nWhenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men’s protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, ‘Account overdrawn.’\nWhen you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, ‘Who is destroying the world? You are.\nYou stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why it’s crumbling around you, while you’re damning its life-blood—money. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout men’s history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slaves—slaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebody’s mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepers—as industrialists.\nTo the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a country of money—and I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, man’s mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human being—the self-made man—the American industrialist.\nIf you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choose—because it contains all the others—the fact that they were the people who created the phrase ‘to make money.’ No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity—to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted of obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words ‘to make money’ hold the essence of human morality.\nYet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters’ continents. Now the looters’ credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide— as, I think, he will.\nUntil and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns—or dollars. Take your choice—there is no other—and your time is running out.” 2\nFootnotes\n\n\nRand, A. (1996). Atlas Shrugged.

Although a Greek colony, the city had been subject to Persia for some time, and it remained so for half of Herodotus’ life. He came from a Greek family which enjoyed a position of respect in Halicarnassus, and his uncle, or cousin, Panyasis, was famous in antiquity as an epic poet.\nThe Persian tyranny made any free political life impossible, and Herodotus, after his elementary education, appears to have devoted himself to reading and travelling. In addition to his unusually thorough knowledge of Homer, he had an intimate acquaintance with the whole range of Greek literature. In his History he quotes or shows familiarity with, among others, Hesiod, Hecataeus, Sappho, Solon, Aesop, Simonides of Ceos, Aeschylus, and Pindar. Whether or not the plan of his History governed or grew out of his travels is not known. All the dates of his travels are uncertain; it is thought that most of them were made between his twentieth and thirty-seventh year. The History reveals the elaborateness of his observation and inquiry. He traversed Asia Minor and European Greece probably more than once, visited all the most important islands of the Archipelago—Rhodes, Cyprus, Delos, Paros, Thasos, Samothrace, Crete, Samos, Cythera, and Aegina—made the long journey from Sardis to the Persian capital of Susa, saw Babylon, Colchis, and the western shores of the Euxine as far as the Dnieper, travelled in Scythia, Thrace, and Greater Greece, explored the antiquities of Tyre, coasted along the shores of Palestine, saw Gaza, and made a long stay in Egypt.\nApart from the travels undertaken in his professional capacity, political developments involved Herodotus in many shifts of residence. About 454 B.C. his relative, Panyasis, was executed by Lygdamis, the tyrant of Halicarnassus. Herodotus left his native city for Samos, which was then an important member of the Athenian Confederacy. He was there for seven or eight years and perhaps took part in the preparations for the overthrow of Lygdamis. After the expulsion of the tyrant, in which the Athenian fleet may have been a decisive factor, he returned to Halicarnassus, which then became a member of the Confederacy. He remained there less than a year. It is surmised that an unfavorable reception to parts of his History and the ascendency of the anti-Athenian party caused Herodotus to leave Halicarnassus for Athens.\nAt Athens, Herodotus seems to have been admitted into the brilliant Periclean society. He was particularly intimate with Sophocles, who is said to have written a poem in his honour. Plutarch records that the public readings he gave from his History won such approval that in 445 B.C., on the proposal of Anytus, the Athenian people voted to award him a large sum of money. At one of his recitations, the story is told that the young Thucydides was present with his father and was so moved that he burst into tears, whereupon Herodotus remarked: “Olorus, your son has a natural enthusiasm for letters.”\nDespite his fame in Athens, Herodotus may not have been reconciled to his status as a foreigner without citizenship. He was either unwilling or unable to return to his native land. When in 443 B.C. Pericles sent out a colony to settle Thurii in southern Italy, Herodotus was one of its members. He was then forty years old.\nFrom this point in his career Herodotus disappears completely. He may have undertaken some of his travels after this time, and there is evidence of his returning to Athens, but it is inconclusive. He was undoubtedly occupied with completing and perfecting his History. He may also have composed at Thurii the special work on the history of Assyria to which he refers and which Aristotle quotes.\nFrom the indications afforded by his work it is inferred that he did not live later than 425 B.C. Presumably he died at Thurii; it was there that his tomb was shown in later ages."},"General-Notes/People/Authors/Immanuel-Kant":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/Immanuel-Kant","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/Immanuel Kant.md","title":"Immanuel Kant","links":[],"tags":["Person","Author"],"content":""},"General-Notes/People/Authors/J-Krishnamoorthi":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/J-Krishnamoorthi","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/J Krishnamoorthi.md","title":"J Krishnamoorthi","links":[],"tags":["Person","Author"],"content":""},"General-Notes/People/Authors/Jim-Collins":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/Jim-Collins","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/Jim Collins.md","title":"Jim Collins","links":[],"tags":["Person","Author"],"content":""},"General-Notes/People/Authors/Jordan-Peterson":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/Jordan-Peterson","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/Jordan Peterson.md","title":"Jordan Peterson","links":[],"tags":["Person","Author"],"content":""},"General-Notes/People/Authors/Malcom-Gladwell":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/Malcom-Gladwell","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/Malcom Gladwell.md","title":"Malcom Gladwell","links":[],"tags":["Person","Author"],"content":""},"General-Notes/People/Authors/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.md","title":"Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi","links":[],"tags":["Person","Author"],"content":""},"General-Notes/People/Authors/Naval-Ravikant":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/Naval-Ravikant","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/Naval Ravikant.md","title":"Naval Ravikant","links":["General-Notes/Podcasts/The-Knowledge-Project","AJ","Blog/2022/2022-12-27---The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant"],"tags":["Person","Author"],"content":"\nI got to know about Naval through a podcast on The Knowledge Project.

Vance → Vance’s views on family. Vance is a critic of childlessness and nuclear family model.\nConcepts of “pronatalism” (support increasing birth rate) and “antinatalism” (does not support the push to increase birth rate). Laura Lovett’s book “Conceiving the Future.” Lovett was Dan’s professor at UMass. Lovett’s critique of pronatalism was based on the burden it puts on women and women being told that “their main role or highest purpose was the breed the next generation”.\nDan asks - “But isn’t it also true that a nation or a culture that doesn’t care at all if its people reproduce, is going to disappear relatively quickly?”\nThere probably has to be a balance b/w balance between antinatalism and the necessity of reproduction for cultural continuity.\nIt made me think how the world would be if one section of people in the world reproduce faster than others. There is this fear everywhere. The fear is that the majority who see all of their cultural influences around foresee a future where their culture would be wiped out by the newer generations. It makes it all the more important to spread the knowledge to everyone, treat everyone with respect and aim for peaceful co-existence.

He brings in famous people. People with opposing views on current issues. Very accomplished people from whom there is a lot to learn.\nThe post says that Ferguson claims that learning European classics is essential to being “grown up” or fully human. What about Eastern literature?\nFerguson talks a lot about fighting against wokeness but seems to be actually promoting narrow ideas around European exclusivity and ignoring other cultures.\nThis reminded me of Kerry Walters’s post on foxes and hedgehog (2024-08-03 - In Praise of Foxes &amp; Babblers) and Naomi Kanakia’s post on the Great Books (2024-07-30 - Western Civilization vs Western Literature).\n\n2024-08-01 - Filling Empty Notes\n\ndanallosso.substack.com/p/filling-empty-nodes\nDan reviews his obsidian graph often to find out how many purple nodes are there.

He says they promote woke ideology. Also says professors get paid less in colleges.\nAs someone who liked the college degree experience, I’m not fully onboard with the critics of college degrees.\nThese online programs will attract young people, they will attract older people more, I think.

I think he also seemed to praise companies or leaders who were like hedgehogs.\nSt. Paul was called as a babbler or seed picker by philosophers in Athens when he went to preach there. ‘Seed picker’ is a bird that picks many seeds without knowing what to do with them.

So it is understandable that a non-christian might have this view.\n\n\n\n2024-08-01 - The incoherence of literary critics\n\nwww.woman-of-letters.com/p/the-incoherence-of-the-literary-critics\nLearnt that OTT could stand for over-the-top praise and advise to someone! OTT generally means streaming platforms like Netflix, Prime, etc. Couple of years ago (during covid) OTT was the in-thing to do as a side business.\nNaomi gives OTT inspiration to her friend who is mostly whining and crying. She helps her win some award which launches her into fame and money. But that friend doesn’t repay when the time comes unfortunately.\nShe mentions Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian became famous because of the institutional backing and that is true of any modern book. The book itself is great. But there could be so many McCarthys out there. I’ve heard Blood Meridian mentioned by Jared Henderson also. I’ve got to read this sometime.\nShe makes some predictions about how Substack will evolve.\nMy note - “Thought-provoking post on multiple things - friendship, networking, literary recognition, substack, writing career, etc. The phrase - “Genius is more common than we think” made me think. If you’re a genius and helped a fellow genius become famous and they don’t reciprocate, the public may be aware of only one genius. Social conditions do play a role in how some places and people get recognized and some don’t. People who are able to influence may not even have a wider knowledge than their circle of expertise.”\n\n2024-07-30 - Western Civilization vs World Literature\n\nwww.woman-of-letters.com/p/western-civilization-vs-world-literature\nOrdered the The New Lifetime Reading Plan after reading this post.\nAdler’s “Great Books” (Great Books of the Western World) does not cover eastern literature.\nWestern conservatives support western canon since it is rooted in their culture. Yes, the argument that one needs to understand one’s culture before understanding others is valid. But the argument that this is great and others are not, without reading others, is not valid. For a better world view, it is better to read western and eastern books.\nThe NLRP is a better choice from this perspective.\n\n2024-07-09 - One simple method for reading more books\n\nwww.woman-of-letters.com/p/one-simple-method-for-reading-more\nEliminate other sources of entertainment so that reading remains the only thing. This includes writing.\nReading is not instantly gratifying like social media, games, etc., but rewarding in the long run.\nMy comment - A pragmatic take on improving the amount of time you spend on reading - eliminate other pleasures that compete for your time (and dopamine), including the pleasure of writing! I recommend reading only the first part of the post and not the latter part about insane Sado. (just joking. a jest reference to Naomi asking readers to read only the 4th memoir from Lady Hyegyeong’s memoirs).\n"},"General-Notes/People/Authors/Substack/Noah-Smith":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/Substack/Noah-Smith","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/Substack/Noah Smith.md","title":"Noah Smith","links":[],"tags":["Person","Author","Substack"],"content":"Writes Noahpinion - www.noahpinion.blog/\nDetailed analysis of world affairs - ‘how things came to be’, ‘why is something the way it is’.

So looks like the net effect is not much.\nDeportation just causes a lot of chaos and fear.

I guess Americans genuinely want things to return to normalcy and have election cycles similar to the ones that we had during Clinton and Obama years. Reduce all the nastiness drastically.\nHarris is also moving away from extreme leftists who are also getting defeated in recent polls.\nI hope the good vibes last.

The reason might not be the CHIPS act or government subsidies that got Intel distracted to miss the AI revolution.\nCanada’s economic challenges: It is near to the US, is immigration friendly, and yet is struggling with low productivity. Probably due to red tape and regulations.\nInfrastructure and state capacity: Need to check out Bart’s Fleet of the Future. An example of infra project costing less than planned.\nEast Asian economic development: The zone seems to be doing well. More capital investment.\nRace in American politics: ‘Whites for Kamala’ seems to be a shift in thoughts around race.\nSan Francisco nonprofit corruption: It was an eye opener to know about the corruption in SF non-profits.\n\n2024-08-03 - Why America fell behind in drones\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog/p/why-america-fell-behind-in-drones\nGuest post by a couple of founders of a robotics company making drones.\nLast week I read the post about how the US fell behind in battery and now this. I had always thought that US was far ahead in drones. But looks like the market share for commercial drones is only 10% US and 90% China! For consumer it is 23% US vs 77% China.\nDJI, a Chinese company dominates this area.\nI loved this infographic -  \n\n2024-07-31 - Who is “Weird”\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog/p/whos-weird\nBefore the article I didn’t know that democrats were calling republicans as weird. I check X today and there are so many posts about this. Wow!\nHe says a mild insult like weird is kind of like returning to normal and more decent politics than what we’ve seen in the past few years.\nI was reminded of Steve Jobs’ famous quote - “Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently..”\nRepublicans seem to not like this insult because they don’t want to be seen as outcasts and people who rebel. But things have changed in the couple of decades - “weird” liberal ideas became mainstream, and conservatives have become the new counterculture. So wearing a badge of religion openly is being a ‘rebel’ now.\n\n2024-07-30 - Why did the US miss the battery revolution?\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog/p/why-did-the-us-miss-the-battery-revolution\nGreat article on why the US is so far ahead of other countries. US was at the forefront of every major technological revolution in the last century (probably after the world wars) -  computers, space, nuclear power, semiconductors, internet, etc.\nBut that was not the case with battery innovation. Before this article, I thought US (esp. Tesla) was at the forefront. But looks like Japan and China are far ahead in terms of research and innovation.\nHe gives a few reasons, supply chains, bottoms up manufacturing, etc. It might also be because of the oil companies working against it. The government supported the solar industry a lot. They could have done the same for battery too.\nI still think people in the US are afraid of EVs because batteries could catch fire. Creating large batteries that can store energy would be like having mega deposits of oil underground. Seems like the path to go forward. Can we store enough energy to launch a rocket? May be!\n\n2024-07-26 - Why Trump or Harris might fail to stand up to China\n\nwww.noahpinion.blog/p/why-trump-or-harris-might-fail-to\nLooks like both Trump or Harris would not be able to deliver on what the general public expects from the US leadership - Limit China’s power and influence.\nTrump might sell out for cash, might just focus on empty wins, more talk than action.\nHarris might continue Obama’s policy of ‘engagement’, letting China do its thing, ‘hoping’ that more manufacturing and modernization would lead to liberatization. But that may be false hope. “That attitude was already dangerously complacent in the early 2010s, and to bring it back now would be madness.”\nI guess many people in the US and other parts of the world feel that if that country adopts things in the US, they would be like the US. But that has yet to work. What works in the US works only in the US.\n"},"General-Notes/People/Authors/Substack/Orel-Zilberman":{"slug":"General-Notes/People/Authors/Substack/Orel-Zilberman","filePath":"General Notes/People/Authors/Substack/Orel Zilberman.md","title":"Orel Zilberman","links":[],"tags":["Person","Author","Substack"],"content":"Writes Tech Books - techbooks.substack.com/\n\n2024-07-28 - Steve Jobs\n\ntechbooks.substack.com/p/steve-jobs\nDoes his legacy still live on?

She enjoys occasional moments of freedom when she goes barefoot but maintains that she is content with wearing the shoe.\nThought-provoking and sad. Could apply to other relationships also. I guess if someone meets a full-of-life individual a few years after their marriage and if they seem like their confidence is broken and light is snuffed out of them, it is probably due to their marriage even though they might vehemently deny it and be proud of being married.\n\n2024-07-26 - Samaroo - 100-word story\n\narrivalsanddepartures.substack.com/p/samaroo\nA naive villager comes to work for the author’s mother.

Reminded me of suppandi.\nHis fame spreads as a stupid person (probably). But he has the last laugh when he elopes with girl-servant next door. I guess one should not write off anybody.\n\nJun 2024 - Maya - sci-fi story\n\nMaya, The Beginning - arrivalsanddepartures.substack.com/p/maya-the-beginning\n\nWonderful story, Reena. Great set up. Engaging and thought-provoking. Enjoyed reading it. Looking forward to reading the other parts. I probably have to read this again and grasp a few more things about this world before starting on the next.\n\n\nMaya, The Middle - arrivalsanddepartures.substack.com/p/maya-the-middle\n\nBrilliant follow up to the story’s first part. Even if everyone tells him to “let.it.go”, I guess Rams cannot. One of the most under-recognized issue with life is how someone’s words could twist our minds. Once you hear the wrong gossip or when someone puts an idea into your mind, it is not easy to get away from it, especially when it comes to opinion of someone’s character. It grows uncontrolled in the mind, taking over sleep and moments of quiet. I’m reminded of this quote from Inception - “The most resilient parasite is an idea … Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it’s almost impossible to eradicate.”\nLooking forward to reading the next part. A lot of things to ponder about - much like Black mirror - the unintentional side effects of technology and unbridled optimism.\n\n\nMaya, The End - arrivalsanddepartures.substack.com/p/maya-the-end\n\nHi Reena, the finale was powerful and deeply moving. I felt sad for Raman only because I’m a techno-optimist, hoping for a utopian future as technology evolves. I was hoping till the end that Maya turns out to be Maya (illusion) and a CF. I wanted Raman’s gut feeling to be validated. But I guess gut feelings can be wrong if you’ve blocked out a part of you as a result of childhood trauma.\nThe twist in the tale of Dr. Roshan being Maya’s sister was so unexpected and made me want to read the story from the beginning again. Even if you’re estranged for long, family always has your back when things go wrong!\nThe last line packed a lot of punch - “Then he’d have to find his way home—to Maya, to his real family, and to the Raman he’d lost a long time ago!” Unforgettable.\nThanks for writing and sharing.

They always take priority.\nRising Early\nThis is the keystone habit upon which all the others rely. There is something magical about waking up before anyone else. It has to be before the sun so that I can glimpse that orange-yellow ball of fire igniting the sky and my being. There is a quiet peace all around, punctuated by the whispers of the birds that grow into a symphony of sounds. It’s as if I’m one with God, residing in the Garden of Eden, albeit only for 30 minutes.\nMeditation\nI’m no Buddhist monk, and I still struggle with meditation. I often sit for long spells where my mind is active. However, I do notice a cumulative effect on my inner peace when I’m consistent with it. There is something I can’t quantify that makes it work. My meditation practice is a simple one; I follow my breath in and out for 20 minutes. Every time my mind wanders, I gently prod it back without judgement.\nJournalling\nEvery morning, I write three hand-written morning pages as prescribed by Julia Cameron in The Artist’s Way. In them, I dump everything and anything that comes to mind in a stream of consciousness manner. This has a cathartic effect on me, and I find that I manage to tackle issues that have become urgent in my subconscious mind and are bubbling to the surface. I hardly ever go back and read my journals; they are gone and assimilated.\nExercise\nI love exercising in the morning, as it gives me so much energy that overflows into the rest of my day. I’m filled up with endorphins and feel like Alexander the Great going after his next conquest. However, I keep it simple so it’s doable and I don’t arrive tired to work. It could be a light jog, a quick high-intensity interval training routine, or a basic strength workout, but nothing longer than 30-40 minutes. I am not to be Mr Universe or a super athlete but rather to remain healthy and high on endorphins.\nReading\nI try to read for an hour a day. That could be in the early morning, evening, or just before I sleep, but I must read. Reading is soul-nourishing and has opened me to new worlds, ideas, and lives I could never have imagined otherwise. Some authors have become virtual mentors and soulmates. I could say I learned how life works solely from Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet. I know much about the slums of Mumbai even though I’ve never been there, thanks to Gregory David Roberts’s Shantaram. Reading is also one-half the practice to better writing.\nWriting\nI write for an hour a day, usually after coming home from work in the early evening or early morning, especially as I awaken very early these days. I’ve found joy in this “systems approach” I hadn’t used before. This daily hour of writing adds up after a week, and if I add some extra ones on the weekend, I can total 10 hours a week.\nThat’s much more than when I used to binge-write once a week. I’m also now in a constant writing mood. Ideas flow; true to Hemingway’s words, “the well is always overflowing,” and I leave it without emptying it. Writing is the language my soul uses to express itself and share itself with the world—I’ve denied it for far too long to stop now."},"General-Notes/Text-Books/CISSP-Guide-to-Security-Essentials,-2nd-Edition":{"slug":"General-Notes/Text-Books/CISSP-Guide-to-Security-Essentials,-2nd-Edition","filePath":"General Notes/Text Books/CISSP Guide to Security Essentials, 2nd Edition.md","title":"CISSP Guide to Security Essentials, 2nd Edition","links":["posts/books/files/CISSP-Guide-Security-Essentials-TOC.pdf"],"tags":["Cybersecurity","Non-Fiction","Textbook"],"content":"\n“If the Internet were a city street, I would not travel it in daylight.”\n~ CISSP Guide to Security Essentials by Peter Gregory 1\n\nIt is a good introductory book to learn security concepts. It covers a lot of ground, is well written. It can be used as a textbook to teach foundational concepts at an undergraduate level. Also, since people are introduced to technology way ahead in their life in today’s times, I think this book could also be a reference to high school teachers.\nNotes 2\nChapter 1. Information Security and Risk Management\nOrganizational Purpose\n\nMission - An overarching statement of purpose and reason for existence of a company.\nObjectives - An objective is something that needs to be achieved\nGoals - A goal (or a Key Result) is a specific and time-bound activity that is measurable and contributes to accomplishing an objective.\nSecurity Support of M/O/G - Security professionals develop processes and practices to protect assets. They assess risk and put risk mitigation plans in place.\n\nRisk Management\n\nProcess of identifying and managing risks, minimizing losses.\n\nRisk Management Principles\n\nRisk Assessment - How to assess risk?\n\nQualitative Risk Assessment - Assess risk in relative terms using descriptive information that is generally not precisely measurable. Characteristics - Classification based on risk, Vulnerabilities, Threats, Threat Probability (L/M/H), Impact (L/M/H), Countermeasures\nQuantitative Risk Assessment - Assess risk using measurable values (metrics). Elements of Quant Risk Assessment - Asset Value (AV), Exposure Factor (EF), Single loss expectancy (SLE) = AV ($) x EF (%), Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO), Annual loss expectancy (ALE) = ARO x SLE.\n\nQuantifying Countermeasures - Countermeasures that were expressed as ‘list of things to do’ in Qualitative Assessment can be quantified using ALE. The benefit from countermeasures can be expressed in terms of costs of countermeasures, changes in EF or SLE.\nGeographic considerations - Organizations can up-level their quantitative assessments by calculating the metrics per geographic location.\n\n\nSpecific Risk Assessment Methodologies - For complex organizations, there are many formal risk assessment methodologies developed by governmental organizations and large companies. Some of them are - OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) developed by CMU’s SEI, FRAP (Facilitated Risk Analysis Process),  Spanning Tree Analysis (similar to a mind map), and NIST 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems.\n\n\nRisk Treatment - How to manage assessed risks? Four general approaches - Avoid, Mitigate, Accept, Transfer.\n\nRisk Avoidance - Remove the activity/asset that introduces the risk from the system.\nRisk Mitigation - Use countermeasures to reduce the impact.\nRisk Acceptance - Accept the risk, especially if it is below some acceptance threshold.\nRisk Transfer - Transfer the cost of impact to someone else, say an insurance company.\nResidual Risk - Risk that remains after doing the above strategies (avoid, mitigate, transfer).\n\n\n\nSecurity Management Concepts\n\nSecurity moved from a task to a standalone professional discipline. So there are frameworks and foundational concepts that one needs to know.\nISO 27001 (specifically ISO/IEC 27000:2018) is a widely known standard and provides and overview of information security management systems (ISMS).\nSecurity Controls - Controls that are put in place in an organization to ensure adherence to security policies. Measures to reduce risk.\nCIA Triad - Confidentiality (Only authorized people can access data), Integrity (Data is not tampered with unless authorized), Availability (System is available for users to use).\nDefense in Depth - Do not rely on a single method of protecting assets. Use multiple layers (comprehensive), different types (heterogeneity).\nSingle Points of Failure (SPOF) - Failure of one component results in failure of the entire system.\nFail open, Fail closed, Fail safe - Fail open - A security control fails, but the system functions, Fail closed - A security control fails and the system stops working, Fail safe - A security control fails, but the system functions\nPrivacy - PII\n\nSecurity Management\nSecurity Strategies\nPersonnel Security\nChapter 2. Access Controls\nChapter 3. Software Development Security\nChapter 4. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery\nChapter 5. Cryptography\nChapter 6.

Can have any shape.\nPrototype based (center based) -  an object in a cluster is closer (more similar) to the “center” of a cluster, than to the center of any other cluster.\n\nfor data with continuous attributes, center is often the centroid. when centroid is not meaningful (data with categorical attributes), centre is often the medoid.\ntends to be globular.\n\n\nGraph based - group of objects that are connected to one another but have no connection to objects outside the group. (Connected Components)\n\nContiguity-based - 2 objects are connected only if they are within a specified distance of each other. Useful when clusters are irregular or intertwined.\nClique - another example of graph based cluster.\n\n\nDensity based - a cluster is a dense region of objects that is surrounded by a region of low density. Used when clusters are irregular or intertwined and when noise and outliers are present.\nShared property (conceptual clustering) - Finds clusters that share some common property or represent a particular concept.\nObjective function - Finds clusters that minimize or maximize an objective function.\n\n\nCharacteristics of Input data\n\nType of proximity/density measure\nSparseness\nAttribute Type\nType of data\nDimensionality\nNoise and Outliers\nType of Distribution\n\n\nClustering Algorithms\n\nK-means - prototype based, partitional clustering technique - finds k clusters represented by their centroids.\nHierarchical Clustering - leaves are singletons, top down or bottom up.\nDBSCAN - density based, partial that produces a partitional clustering. number of clusters is automatically determined by the algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2 K-means\n\nPartitional clustering technique in which each cluster is associated with a centroid and each point is assigned to a cluster with the closest centroid. Number of clusters K, must be given as input.\n8.2.1 The basic K-means algorithm\n\nInitial centroids are often chosen randomly.\nThe centroid is generally the mean of the points in the cluster\nCloseness is measured by Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, correlation ..etc.\nMost of the convergence happens the first few iterations\nComplexity is O(I * K * m * n)\nAssigning points to the closest centroid - Manhattan(L1) distance can be used for Euclidean data, Jaccard measure for document data\nCentroids and Objective function - e.g for objective function : minimize the squared distance of each point to its closest centroid.\nData in Euclidean space - Objective function used is SSE(Sum of Squared Error) also known as ‘scatter’.\n\nwhere dist is the standard Euclidean (L2) distance b/w objects.\nCentroid that minimizes the SSE of a cluster is the mean\nGiven 2 different sets of clusters, we prefer one with lower SSE.\n\n\nDocument data\n\nrepresented as a DTM(document term matrix)\nobjective is to maximize similarity of the objects in the cluster to cluster centroid.\nThe analogous quantity to SSE is ‘total cohesion’\n\n\nThe General case\n\nThere are many choices for the proximity function, centroid and objective function that can be used in basic k-means algorithm and that are guaranteed to converge.\nBregman divergence includes squared Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance and cosine similarity.\n\n\nChoosing initial centroids\n\nEg. 1 - Poor initial centroids : Randomly selected initial centroids may provide sub-optimal clustering with a higher SSE.\nEg. 2 - Limits of random initialization\nIf there are K ‘real’ clusters, chance of selecting one centroid from each is very small.\n\n\nSolutions to Initial centroids problem\n\nPerform multiple runs\n\nOne way to minimize the effect or a poor random initial choice of centroids is to perform multiple runs.\nBut this also need not give optimal clustering. If a centroid falls between a pair of clusters, it will be stuck there by making one cluster out of 2.\n\n\nUse hierarchical clustering on a sample\n\nOne effective approach to counter the limitations of random poor initial centroids is to take a sample of points and cluster them using hierarchical clustering technique and use those centroids as initial centroids.\nBut this is practical only if sample is relatively small and k is small compared to sample size.\n\n\nIterative approach\n\nSelect first point at random (or take centroid of all points)\nfor each successive initial centroid, select a point that is farthest from the previously selected centroids.\nthe downside is that this could select outliers.\n\n\nSelect more than K centroids\nPost processing\nBisecting K-means\n\n\nTime and Space complexity\n\nStorage required : O((m + K)n) , m = number of points, n = number of attributes\nTime required : O(I * K * m * n) , I = number of iterations\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 K-means: Additional issues\n\nHandling empty clusters\n\nBasic K-means algo can yield empty clusters.\nChoose a replacement otherwise SSE will be large\nApproach 1 : Choose a replacement point that is farthest from any current centroid\nApproach 2 : Choose a replacement point from the centroid that has highest SSE. This would split the cluster and reduce overall SSE.\n\n\nOutliers\n\nIf there are outliers, centroids may not be as representative as they ought to be and SSE would be higher as well.\nOne approach is to discover outliers and eliminate them beforehand. But there could be situations where outliers are important (compression, financial data)\nAnother approach is to identify outliers during pre-processing. Identify points with high contributions to SSE.\nAlso we could eliminate small clusters\n\n\nReducing the SSE with post processing\n\nOne way to reduce SSE is to increase number of clusters (larger K). 2 strategies that decrease SSE by increasing K are -\n\nSplit a cluster - Choose a cluster with largest SSE or largest standard deviation for an attribute.\nIntroduce a new centroid - One approach is to choose a point farthest from any cluster center. Another is to choose a point at random.\n\n\n2 strategies that decrease K and try to minimize the SSE increase are -\n\nDisperse a cluster - removing a centroid and assigning the points to other clusters.  Disperse a cluster that doesn’t contribute much to the total SSE.\nMerge 2 clusters - Clusters with closest centroids are usually chosen. Strategy is same as that used in hierarchical clustering.\nCommonly used approach is to alternate cluster splitting and merging phases.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating centroids incrementally\n\nIn the basic K-means algorithm, centroids are updated after all points are assigned to a centroid. An alternative is to update the centroids after each assignment (incremental approach). Each assignment updates 0 or 2 centroids.\nPros\n\nGuarantees that empty clusters are not produced.\nRelative weights may be adjusted. Better accuracy and faster convergence are possible if weights are used.\n\n\nCons:\n\nIt is more expensive\nIntroduces an order dependency (clusters produced depends on the order in which points are processed) . Although this can be overcome by randomizing the order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Bisecting K-means\n\nA straightforward extension of the basic K-means algorithm that is based on a simple idea: to obtain K clusters, split the set of all points into two clusters, select one of these clusters to split, and so on, until K clusters have been produced.\nThere are different ways to choose which cluster to split, say using size or SSE.\nUsually the the clusters are refined by using the resulting centroids as initial centroids for basic k-means algorithm. This is useful since during bisecting k-means we’re using k-means algorithm ‘locally’\nBisecting K-means is less susceptible to initialization problems.\nAlso we can use bisecting k-means for hierarchical clustering.\n\n\n8.2.4 K-means and different types of clusters\n\nK-means has difficulty in detecting natural clusters when clusters have non-spherical shapes or widely different sizes or densities.\nThis could be overcome if the user is willing to increase K and have more clusters. So a cluster might have many sub clusters.\n\n\n8.2.5 Strengths and weaknesses\n\nStrengths : Used for wide variety of data types, Very efficient\nWeaknesses : Cannot handle non-globular clusters, not good with data that has outliers.\n\n\n8.2.6 K-means as an optimization problem\n\nGradient descent - involves picking an initial solution and then repeating the fol- lowing two steps: compute the change to the solution that best optimizes the objective function and then update the solution.\nDerivation of K-means as an algorithm to minimize the SSE (sum of squared errors): Proof that the best centroid for minimizing the SSE of a cluster is the mean of the points in the cluster.\nDerivation of K-means for SAE (sum of absolute errors) : Ck is the median of the cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3 Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering\n\n2 approaches of hierarchical clustering -\n\nAgglomerative - Start with the points as individual clusters and, at each step, merge the closest pair of clusters.\nDivisive - Start with one, all-inclusive cluster and, at each step, split a cluster until only singleton clusters of individual points remain.\n\n\nOften displayed graphically using a tree-like diagram called dendogram, which displays sub-cluster relationships and also the order in which the clusters were merged.\nDon’t have to assume any particular number of clusters.\nMay correspond to meaningful taxonomies.\n8.3.1 Basic Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm\n\nKey operation is the computation of proximity\nDefining proximity b/w clusters\n\nCluster proximity is typically defined with a particular type of cluster in mind. For example, many agglomerative hierarchical clustering techniques, such as MIN, MAX, and Group Average, come from a graph-based view of clusters.\n\n\nTime and Space complexity\n\nProximity matrix requires the storage of 1/m^2 proximities. The space needed to keep track of the clusters is proportional to the number of clusters. Hence, the total space complexity is O(m^2).\nThere are m steps and at each step the size, m^2, proximity matrix must be updated and searched. So time complexity is O(m^3). It can be reduced to O(m^2 log m) by keeping the data in a sorted list or heap\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Specific Techniques of similarity measures\n\nMIN (single link)\n\nSimilarity of two clusters is based on the two most similar (closest) points in the different clusters. Determined by one pair of points, i.e., by one link in the proximity graph.\nStrength : Can handle non-eliptical shapes.\nWeakness : Sensitive to noise and outliers.\n\n\nMAX (complete link)\n\nSimilarity of two clusters is based on the two least similar (most distant) points in the different clusters. Determined by all pairs of points in the two clusters.\nStrength : Less susceptible to noise and outliers\nWeakness : Tends to break large clusters, Biased towards globular clusters\n\n\nGroup Average\n\nProximity of two clusters is the average of pairwise proximity between points in the two clusters.\nCompromise between Single and Complete Link\nStrength : Less susceptible to noise and outliers\nWeakness : Biased towards globular clusters\n\n\nWard’s method\n\nSimilarity of two clusters is based on the increase in squared error when two clusters are merged.\nSimilar to group average if distance between points is distance squared.\nHierarchical analogue of K-means – Can be used to initialize K-means.\nStrength : Less susceptible to noise and outliers\nWeakness : Biased towards globular clusters\n\n\nDistance between centroids : Similarity of two clusters is based on the distance between the centroids in the different clusters.\n\n\n8.3.3 The Lance-Williams formula for Cluster Proximity\n\nA general formula for expressing hierarchical clustering proximity\nAny of the cluster proximities that we have discussed above can be viewed as a choice of different parameters in the Lance-Williams formula\n\n\n8.3.4 Key Issues in Hierarchical clustering\n\nLack of a global objective function : It is greedy technique in which optimization is done locally at that specific moment.\nAbility to handle different cluster sizes : In order to take care of the relative sizes of the clusters that are merged, we could take weights into account.\n\nUPGMA - Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages.\nWPGMA - Weighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages.\n\n\nMerging decisions are final: Once the decision is made, it cannot be undone at a later time.\n\n\n8.3.5 Strengths and Weaknesses : Already discussed above.\n\n\n\n8.4 DBSCAN\n\nDensity-based clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. DBSCAN is a simple and effective density-based clustering algorithm.\n8.4.1 Traditional Density: Center-based approach\n\nIn the center-based approach, density is estimated for a particular point in the data set by counting the number of points within a specified radius, Eps, of that point. This includes the point itself.\nClassification of Points According to Center-Based Density\n\nCore point: A point is a core point if it has more than a specified number of points (MinPts) within Eps.\nBorder point: A border point has fewer than MinPts within Eps, but is in the neighborhood of a core point.\nNoise point: A noise point is any point that is neither a core point nor a border point.\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 The DBSCAN algorithm\n\nTime and Space complexity\n\nThe basic time complexity of the DBSCAN algorithm is O(m × time to find points in the Eps-neighborhood), where m is the number of points. In the worst case, this complexity is O(m^2). If a different data structure is used, it could be as low as O(m logm).\nThe space requirement is O(m).\n\n\nSelection of DBSCAN Parameters\n\nThe big question for DBSCAN is “how to determine the parameters Eps and MinPts ?”\nThe basic approach is to look at the behavior of the distance from a point to its kth nearest neighbor(k-dist).\nUsually points within cluster will have small k-dist and noise points will have large k-dist. So if we compute the k-dist for all the data points for some k, sort them in increasing order, and then plot the sorted values, we expect to see a sharp change at the value of k-dist that corresponds to a suitable value of Eps.\n\n\nClusters of Varying Density\n\nDBSCAN can have trouble with density if the density of clusters varies widely.\nIf the Eps threshold is low and if the densities vary, the denser clusters will be picked up and the dilute ones might be categorized as noise.\n\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nStrengths\n\nResistant to Noise\nCan handle clusters of different shapes and sizes\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDoesn’t work well for clusters with varying densities\nDoesn’t work well for High-dimensional data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5 Cluster Evaluation\n\nFor supervised classification we have a variety of measures to evaluate how good our model is – Accuracy, precision, recall\nFor cluster analysis, the analogous question is “how to evaluate ‘the goodness’ of the resulting clusters?”\nThe difficulty - Many times clustering is done as part of exploratory data analysis. So validation may not be needed. Also, different clustering algorithms might need different evaluation techniques - SSE might be suited for K-means but not for DBSCAN.\n8.5.1 Overview\n\nAspects of Cluster Validation\n\nDetermining the clustering tendency of a set of data, (distinguishing whether non-random structure actually exists in the data).\nDetermining the correct number of clusters.\nEvaluating how well the results of a cluster analysis fit the data without reference to external information.\nComparing the results of a cluster analysis to externally known results, such as externally provided class labels.\nComparing two sets of clusters to determine which is better.\n\n\nItems 1, 2, and 3 do not make use of any external information - they are unsupervised techniques - while item 4 requires external information. Item 5 can be performed in either a supervised or an unsupervised manner.\nThe evaluation measures (indices), that are applied to judge various aspects of cluster validity are traditionally classified into the following three types -\n\nUnsupervised (Internal indices) -\n\nMeasures the goodness of a clustering structure without referring to external information.\ne.g SSE\nFurther divided into 2 classes - measures of cluster cohesion, cluster separation\n\n\nSupervised (External indices)\n\nMeasures the extent to which the clustering structure discovered by a clustering algorithm matches some external structure.\ne.g Entropy (measures how well cluster labels match externally supplied class labels)\n\n\nRelative\n\nCompares different clusterings or clusters\ne.g Two K-means clusterings can be compared using either the SSE or entropy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.2 Unsupervised Cluster Evaluation Using Cohesion and Separation\n\nCluster validity for a set of K clusters is a weighted sum of the validity of individual clusters.\nThe validity function can be cohesion, separation or some combination of these. The weights will vary depending on the validity measure. For cohesion, higher values are better, for separation, lower values are better.\nGraph-Based View of Cohesion and Separation\n\nCohesion of a cluster = sum of the weights of the links in the proximity graph that connect points within the cluster.\nSeparation between two clusters = sum of the weights of the links from points in one cluster to points in the other cluster.\nThe proximity function can be a similarity, a dissimilarity, or a simple function of these quantities\n\n\nPrototype-Based View of Cohesion and Separation\n\nCohesion of a cluster = sum of the proximities with respect to the prototype (centroid or medoid) of the cluster.\nSeparation between two clusters = proximity of the two cluster prototypes.\nThere are two measures for separation because, the separation of cluster prototypes from an overall prototype is sometimes directly related to the separation of cluster prototypes from one another\n\n\nOverall Measures of Cohesion and Separation\n\nThe previous measures (cohesion &amp; separation) can be combined into an overall measure of cluster validity by using a weighted sum.\n\n\nRelationship between Prototype-Based Cohesion and Graph-Based Cohesion\n\nFor some proximity measures, the measures of cohesion and separation are equivalent for Graph-based and prototype-based approaches even though they seem distinct.\nFor instance, for the SSE and points in Euclidean space, it can be shown that the average pairwise distance between the points in a cluster is equivalent to the SSE of the cluster\n\n\nTwo Approaches to Prototype-Based Separation\n\nWhen proximity is measured by Euclidean distance, the traditional measure of separation between clusters is the between group sum of squares (SSB), which is the sum of the squared distance of a cluster centroid.\nThe higher the total SSB of a clustering, the more separated the clusters are from one another.\n\n\nRelationship between Cohesion and Separation\n\nIn some cases there is a strong relationship b/w cohesion and separation. It is possible to show that the sum of the total SSE and the total SSB is a constant.\nTotal sum of Squares (TSS) = sum of squares of the distance of each point to the overall mean of the data.\nTSS = SSE + SSB\nThe importance of this result is that minimizing SSE (cohesion) is equivalent to maximizing SSB (separation).\n\n\nEvaluating Individual Clusters and Objects\n\nMany of the measures that we studied above can be used to evaluate individual clusters and objects.\nWe could rank individual clusters according to their specific value of cluster validity (cohesion or separation) and make some observations -\nSince higher value of cohesion may be better than lower, we could decide to split a cluster with lower value.\nIf separation between clusters is low, we could decide to merge the clusters.\nObjects that contribute more to the cohesion and separation are probably near the interior of the cluster and others are probably near the edge.\n\n\nThe Silhouette Coefficient\n\nHow to compute Silhouette coefficient\n\nFor the i th object, calculate its average distance to all other objects in its cluster. Call this value ai.\nFor the i th object and any cluster not containing the object, calculate the object’s average distance to all the objects in the given cluster. Find the minimum such value with respect to all clusters; call this value bi.\nSilhouette coefficient, si = (bi − ai)/ max(ai, bi).\n\n\nThe value of the silhouette coefficient can vary between −1 and 1.\nWhen\na_i = 0, s_i = 1\n\n\n\n\n8.5.3 Unsupervised Cluster Evaluation Using the Proximity Matrix\n\nMeasuring Cluster Validity via Correlation\n\nInput → Similarity matrix for a data set and the cluster labels from a cluster analysis of the data set.\nOutput → Evaluate “goodness” of the clustering by looking at the correlation between the similarity matrix and the cluster labels.\nWhile computing the correlation, since the matrices are symmetric, only the correlation between n (n - 1) / 2 entries needs to be calculated.\nHigh correlation indicates that points that belong to the same cluster are close to each other.\n\n\nJudging a Clustering Visually by Its Similarity Matrix\n\nIf we sort the rows and columns of the similarity matrix so that all objects belonging to the same class are together, then an ideal similarity matrix has a block diagonal structure.\nWell-separated clusters show a very strong, block- diagonal pattern in the reordered similarity matrix.\n\n\nComputation of the proximity matrix takes O(m ^ 2) time\n\n\n8.5.4 Unsupervised Evaluation of Hierarchical Clustering\n\nPrevious approaches are for paritional clusterings.\nCophenetic correlation is a popular evaluation measure for hierarchical clusterings\nCophenetic distance between two objects = Proximity at which an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique puts the objects in the same cluster for the first time.\nThe CoPhenetic Correlation Coefficient (CPCC) is the correlation between the entries of the cophenic distance matrix and the original dissimilarity matrix and is a standard measure of how well a hierarchical clustering (of a particular type) fits the data.\n\n\n8.5.5 Determining the Correct Number of Clusters\n\nPlot SSE and Silhouette co-efficient for different values of k.\nChoose k where there is a distinct knee in the SSE and a distinct peak in the silhouette coefficient\n\n\n8.5.6 Clustering Tendency\n\nClustering algorithms produce clusters for any input data. But can the data even be clustered ?\nOne approach is to evaluate the resulting clusters and only claim that a data set has clusters if at least some of the clusters are of ‘good’ quality. To make sure that the poor quality is not due to wrong choice of algorithm, we could use multiple algorithms and again evaluate the quality of the resulting clusters.\nAnother approach is to try to evaluate whether a data set has clusters without clustering. Most common approach, especially for data in Euclidean space, has been to use statistical tests for spatial randomness\n\n\n8.5.7 Supervised Measures of Cluster Validity\n\nIf we have external information about data, say in the form of class labels for the data objects, we could measure the degree of correspondence between the cluster labels and the class labels.\nWe could have different approaches to measure the extent to which two objects that are in the same class are in the same cluster.  There are 2 main approaches - classification oriented and similarity oriented.\nClassification-Oriented Measures of Cluster Validity\n\nUses measures from classification, such as entropy, purity, and the F-measure. These measures evaluate the extent to which a cluster contains objects of a single class.\nEntropy : The degree to which each cluster consists of objects of a single class\nPurity: Another measure of the extent to which a cluster contains objects of\na single class.\nPrecision : The fraction of a cluster that consists of objects of a specified class.\nRecall : The extent to which a cluster contains all objects of a specified class.\nF-measure : A combination of both precision and recall that measures the extent to which a cluster contains only objects of a particular class and all objects of that class.\n\n\nSimilarity-Oriented Measures of Cluster Validity\n\nWe can view this approach to cluster validity as involving the comparison of two matrices:\n(1) the ideal cluster similarity matrix discussed previously, which has a 1 if two objects are in the same cluster and 0 otherwise, and\n(2) an ideal class similarity matrix defined with respect to class labels, which has 1 if objects are in the same class and 0 otherwise.\nRand statistic and Jaccard coefficient are two of the most frequently used cluster validity measures.\n\n\nCluster Validity for Hierarchical Clusterings\n\nSupervised evaluation of a hierarchical clustering is more difficult for a variety of reasons, including the fact that a preexisting hierarchical structure often does not exist\nTo evaluate a hierarchical clustering, we compute,\nfor each class, the F-measure for each cluster in the cluster hierarchy.\nFor each class, we take the maximum F- measure attained for any cluster.\nFinally, we calculate an overall F-measure for the hierarchical clustering by computing the weighted average of all per-class F-measures, where the weights are based on the class sizes.\n\n\n\n\n8.5.8 Assessing the Significance of Cluster Validity Measures\n\nHow do we interpret the significance of the number given by a cluster evaluation technique ?\nNeed to be aware of the basic definitions of evaluation measures used, like - a purity of 0 is bad, while a purity of 1 is good, an entropy of 0 is good, as is an SSE of 0.\nIf we don’t have an absolute standard, a common approach is to interpret the value of our validity measure in statistical terms. e.g - plotting a histogram of SSE for random data sets.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow ! That was a really long chapter and took 1 full day to read through! Thanks to Tan, Steinbach and Kumar for an excellent narrative.\nI really cannot forget this quote -\n\n“Just as people can find patterns in clouds, data mining algorithms can find clusters in random data. While it is entertaining to find patterns in clouds, it is pointless and perhaps embarrassing to find clusters in noise.”\n\nRef :\n\nPower Point slides : www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/index.php#item4\nSample Chapters : www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/index.php#item2\n"},"General-Notes/Time-Tips":{"slug":"General-Notes/Time-Tips","filePath":"General Notes/Time Tips.md","title":"Time Tips","links":[],"tags":["Tips"],"content":"\nCount all your time as time to be used and make every attempt to get satisfaction out of every moment.\nFind something to enjoy in whatever you do.\nTry to be an optimist and seek out the good in your life.\nFind ways to build on your successes.\nStop regretting your failures and start learning from your mistakes.\nRemind yourself, “There is always enough time for the important things.” If it is important, you should be able to make time to do it.\nContinually look at ways of freeing up your time.\nExamine your old habits and search for ways to change or eliminate them.\nTry to use waiting time.

Was reminded of that again when I read today’s WSJ. The paper had a section towards the end dedicated to Cybersecurity. It had interesting articles like “The industries most vulnerable to cyberattack and why”, “How and when to teach kids to use passwords”, “The dangerous secrets our photos reveal”, “The added security risks of working from home”, etc. Each article was well articulated and thought provoking.\nWhat caught my attention was an article named “A cybersecurity reading list”. I checked online and the same article was titled “Five Cybersecurity Books That Everyone Should and Can Read”. Though I’ve linked the article here, you might not be able to see it since it is probably paywalled.\nI was eager to see if the list had books that I’ve read or heard about. Unfortunately, I’d heard of only 2 books - “Countdown to Zero Day” by Kim Zetter and 2022-07-31 - The Cuckoo’s Egg by Clifford Stoll. The Cuckoo’s Egg is on my Amazon wishlist but haven’t gotten around to buying or reading it yet. I’d read of Cyberattack being referred to as the “Fifth Domain” of warfare but didn’t know about the book. But I haven’t read any and surely must read a couple before the end of the year.\nTop 5 books from WSJ article\nThe 5 books are as follows -\n\n\nCountdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon by Kim Zetter. Stuxnet is regarded as the world’s first digital weapon. It is the malware that crippled Iran’s nuclear-fuel enrichment program. In the book, Kim Zetter investigates the malware and provides a detailed account of the timeline from origin to release. Along the way, she explains key cybersecurity concepts.\n\n\nThe Cuckoo’s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage by Clifford Stoll. Lawrence Berkeley Lab is less than an hour’s drive from my home. So it actually feels like something that happened right here. In the book, Stoll is assigned to investigate an accounting error of 75 cents and that leads into a computer espionage story of chasing after an unauthorized user who was in their systems. I’m excited at the thought of reading this.\n\n\nThe Fifth Domain: Defending Our Country, Our Companies, and Ourselves in the Age of Cyber Threats by Richard Clarke and Robert Knake. The authors are former government cyber officials from the past 3 administrations. They describe the current efforts to advance security and prevent cyberwarfare and also analyze incidents from the past. The book is a warning as well as a study guide for everyone to understand the looming threat of cyber warfare.\n\n\nCult of the Dead Cow by Joseph Menn. I have a newfound respect for Beto O’Rourke after learning that he was part of cDc (Cult of the Dead Cow) which is the oldest, most respected, and most famous American hacking group of all time.\n\n\nSandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin’s Most Dangerous Hackers by Andy Greenberg. I’m not sure if the title is a reference to the giant sandworms in Dune/Arrakis. Those are huge and dangerous beings with mouth as large as 40 meters (over 100 ft!!). For a description of Dune’s sandworms see Ultimate Guide To Dune (Part 1) The Introduction(12:13). In Sandworm (the book), Andy Greenberg, a journalist for Wired, writes about cyber incidents from 2014 to the release of NotPetya malware in 2017. Causing over $10 billion in damage, the malware destroyed public utilities (especially Electric grids) in Ukraine and other European countries.\n\n\nThought I’d do a Google search of “Cybersecurity Books That Everyone Should Read” to add to this list, or may be make it to 10.\nOther top security book lists\nThe Best Cyber Security Books recommended by Josephine Wolff has the following -\n\nSpam Nation: The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime-from Global Epidemic to Your Front Door by Brian Krebs\nCountdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon  by Kim Zetter\nWorm: The First Digital World War by Mark Bowden\nDark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War by Fred Kaplan\nBytes, Bombs, and Spies: The Strategic Dimensions of Offensive Cyber Operations by Amy Zegart &amp; Herbert Lin\n\n\nThe 11 Best Cyber Security Books — Recommendations from the Experts from HashedOut has the following\n\nHacking: The Art of Exploitation (2nd Ed.) by Jon Erickson\nThe Art of Invisibility: The World’s Most Famous Hacker Teaches You How to Be Safe in the Age of Big Brother and Big Data by Kevin Mitnick\nGhost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World’s Most Wanted Hacker by Kevin Mitnick, William L.

But a better strategy to get through the books is to have a smaller set to read or to have a couple of text books that you read over and again.

Thought I’d just put them all here. One place to come back to read them over and again!\nHarold Bloom on poetry (from 2024-05-27 - How to Read and Why)\n\n“Poems can help us to speak to ourselves more clearly and more fully, and to overhear that speaking… . We speak to an otherness in ourselves, or to what may be best and oldest in ourselves. We read to find ourselves, more fully and more strange than otherwise we could hope.”\n“Wherever possible, memorize them… . Silent intensive rereadings of a shorter poem that truly finds you should be followed by recitations to yourself until you discover that you are in possession of the poem… . Committed to memory, the poem will possess you, and you will be able to read it more closely, which great poetry demands and rewards.”\n\nThe Arrow and the Song\nby H W Longfellow\nI shot an arrow into the air,\nIt fell to earth, I knew not where;\nFor, so swiftly it flew, the sight\nCould not follow it in its flight.\nI breathed a song into the air,\nIt fell to earth, I knew not where;\nFor who has sight so keen and strong,\nThat it can follow the flight of song?\nLong, long afterward, in an oak\nI found the arrow, still unbroke;\nAnd the song, from beginning to end,\nI found again in the heart of a friend.\nwww.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44624/the-arrow-and-the-song\nOther favorite Longfellow poems -\n\nA Psalm of Life (Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us, Footprints on the sands of time;)\nThe Day is Done (Then read from the treasured volume, The poem of thy choice, And lend to the rhyme of the poet, The beauty of thy voice. And the cares, that infest the day, Shall fold their tents … And as silently steal away)\n\nIf someone asked me what my favorite poem is, this would come to my mind first. I studied this in school long ago but it has always remained in my mind. One thing that blew me about AK was when I asked her what her favorite poem was, she said ‘The Arrow and the Song’! What a coincidence. Of all the places that I could have gone to in the US, I was placed on a project in Portland, Maine! I still remember seeing Longfellow’s statue in the downtown and marveling at how lucky I was. Another coincidence.\n\n”Hope” is the thing with feathers\nby Emily Dickinson\n“Hope” is the thing with feathers \nThat perches in the soul \nAnd sings the tune without the words \nAnd never stops - at all\nAnd sweetest - in the Gale - is heard \nAnd sore must be the storm \nThat could abash the little Bird\nThat kept so many warm\nI’ve heard it in the chillest land \nAnd on the strangest Sea \nYet - never - in Extremity,\nIt asked a crumb - of me.\nwww.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314\nOther favorite Emily Dickinson poems -\n\nSuccess is counted sweetest (By those who ne’er succeed.)\nTell all the truth but tell it slant (The Truth must dazzle gradually, Or every man be blind)\n\n\nIthaca\nby Konstantinos Kavafis\nAs you set out for Ithaka \nhope your road is a long one, \nfull of adventure, full of discovery.\nLaistrygonians, Cyclops,\nangry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:\nyou’ll never find things like that on your way\nas long as you keep your thoughts raised high,\nas long as a rare excitement\nstirs your spirit and your body.\nLaistrygonians, Cyclops,\nwild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them\nunless you bring them along inside your soul,\nunless your soul sets them up in front of you.\nHope your road is a long one.\nMay there be many summer mornings when,\nwith what pleasure, what joy,\nyou enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;\nmay you stop at Phoenician trading stations\nto buy fine things,\nmother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,\nsensual perfume of every kind—\nas many sensual perfumes as you can;\nand may you visit many Egyptian cities\nto learn and go on learning from their scholars.\nKeep Ithaka always in your mind.\nArriving there is what you’re destined for.\nBut don’t hurry the journey at all.\nBetter if it lasts for years,\nso you’re old by the time you reach the island,\nwealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,\nnot expecting Ithaka to make you rich.\nIthaka gave you the marvelous journey.\nWithout her you wouldn’t have set out.\nShe has nothing left to give you now.\nAnd if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.\nWise as you will have become, so full of experience,\nyou’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.\nwww.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51296/ithaka-56d22eef917ec\n\nThe Road Not Taken\nby Robert Frost\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I - \nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference.\nwww.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken\nOther poems by Robert Frost that I liked -\n\nStopping by the woods on a Snowy Evening (has the famous lines I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep)\nMending Wall (Good fences make good neighbors)\nFire and Ice (Inspiration for George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire)\n\n\nIf\nby Rudyard Kipling\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,   \nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;

However media or popular literature of a period portrays it, over the course of human history, leadership has always been about altruism. About someone deciding to take responsibility for someone other than themselves, someone deciding to step up and be the ‘shepherd that gives his life to the lamb’. I’ll expand on this thought later. The focus of this post is to list some outstanding books that could be helpful in general.\nWhile reading Goldratt - The Goal, I happened to land on a website named TOC Institute which had a detailed summary of the Goal. It mentions that ​The Goal is one of three books that Jeff Bezos requires his top management team to read. The 3 books are -\n\nThe Effective Executive by Peter Drucker\nThe Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton Christensen\nGoldratt - The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt and Jeff Cox\n\nI’ve read 1 &amp; 3 and am yet to read #2. I’d definitely recommend 1 &amp; 3 to anyone. Over the last decade, I’ve had the opportunity to groom engineers to become tech leads, architects and first-time engineering managers . Teaching and coaching are my core strengths and I think if I get to do more of it, I’d definitely have more of a sense of fulfillment. For the managers, two books that I’ve always recommended are Management by Drucker and Good to Great by Jim Collins. In fact, the revised edition of Management has an awesome foreword by Jim Collins. My top 3 books would be the following -\n\nManagement : Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices by Peter Drucker\nGood to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don’t  by Jim Collins\n2018-12-05 - Fox - How to Become CEO: The Rules for Rising to the Top of Any Organization by Jeffrey Fox\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are many more great books and a few more come to my mind at this time. Couple of years back, one of my team leads suggested The Manager’s Path and I found it to be an excellent read, especially for folks in management in tech companies. Two other books by Jim Collins that I found to be super inspirational were - Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck—Why Some Thrive Despite Them All and Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies. I listened to the audiobook version of these books during my runs in the past, and they were special because Jim Collins himself narrates them in his very persuasive and inspiring voice. Other books that come to mind are The 5 Levels of Leadership - Proven Steps to Maximize Your Potential by John C. Maxwell, Start with Why by Simon Sinek, and Multipliers - How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter by Liz Wiseman."},"Lists/My-Reading-List":{"slug":"Lists/My-Reading-List","filePath":"Lists/My Reading List.md","title":"Reading List","links":["Lists/Book-Lists","Blog/2020/2020-06-06---My-Reading-Journey","Blog/2019/2019-08-01----12-Rules-for-Life","General-Notes/People/Authors/Jordan-Peterson","Blog/2021/2021-08-07---Beyond-Order","Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Csikszentmihalyi---Flow","General-Notes/People/Authors/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi","General-Notes/People/Authors/Shane-Parrish","General-Notes/Podcasts/The-Knowledge-Project","Blog/2020/2020-04-28---The-Great-Mental-Models,-Volume-1","Blog/2020/2020-10-17---The-Great-Mental-Models,-Volume-2","Blog/2022/2022-09-30---The-Great-Mental-Models,-Volume-3","Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Kahneman---Thinking,-Fast-and-Slow","General-Notes/People/Authors/Daniel-Kahneman","General-Notes/People/Authors/Malcom-Gladwell","Blog/2016/2016-12-15--Blink","Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Gladwell---The-Outliers","Blog/2020/2020-01-18---21-Lessons-for-the-21st-Century","Yuval-Noah-Harari","Blog/2020/2020-10-31---Homo-Deus","General-Notes/Books-to-Read/Meditations","General-Notes/Books-to-Read/Nicomachean-Ethics","Blog/2006/2006-12-10---Covey---The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People","Stephen-Covey","Blog/2016/2016-11-26---The-ONE-Thing","Gary-Keller","Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Gawande---The-Checklist-Manifesto","Atul-Gawande","Blog/2021/2021-03-20---Atomic-Habits","Blog/2020/2020-10-03---Brown---Dare-to-Lead","Blog/2020/2020-10-10---The-Ride-of-a-Lifetime","Blog/2018/2018-12-05---Fox---How-to-Become-CEO","Blog/2020/2020-01-04---Factfulness","General-Notes/People/Authors/Peter-Drucker","General-Notes/People/Authors/Jim-Collins","Book-Notes/Fiction/Herbert---Dune","Blog/2021/2021-06-26---Foundation","Book-Notes/Fiction/Simmons---Hyperion","Book-Notes/Fiction/Stroud---The-Bartimaeus-Trilogy","Book-Notes/Fiction/Dickens---Great-Expectations","Book-Notes/Fiction/Homer---The-Iliad","General-Notes/Books-to-Read/Middlemarch","Book-Notes/Plays/Sophocles---Antigone","Book-Notes/Plays/Sophocles---Oedipus-at-Colonus","Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications","Blog/2016/2016-10-16---Ford---Functional-Thinking","Blog/2019/2019-01-31---Benson,-Loftesness---Payment-Systems-in-the-US","Blog/2020/2020-06-20----Zero-Trust-Networks","Blog/2021/2021-04-03---The-DevOps-Handbook","Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Skelton,-Pais---Team-Topologies","Blog/2020/2020-12-19---The-Phoenix-Project","Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Kim---The-Unicorn-Project","Book-Notes/Fiction/duMaurier---The-King's-General","Book-Notes/Fiction/duMaurier---My-Cousin-Rachel","Book-Notes/Fiction/Gorky---Makar-Chudra","Book-Notes/Fiction/Marquez---Of-Love-and-Other-Demons","Book-Notes/Fiction/Cummins---American-Dirt","Blog/2006/2006-07-02---Aczel---Fermat's-Last-Theorem","Blog/2022/2022-08-31---Cult-of-the-Dead-Cow","Blog/2021/2021-04-17---Fermat's-Enigma","Blog/2021/2021-08-28---The-Code-Book","Book-Notes/Non-Fiction/Gilder---Life-After-Google"],"tags":["List","Reading","Books"],"content":"List of books that I have read, re-read, started to read, heard a lot about and want to read.

A lot of books that I’ve heard of are on this list than the original one, probably because many of them got made into movies and TV series or they featured on airports, costco and other places that I go to.\nHere is the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRankTitleAuthorOn NYT List1Demon CopperheadBarbara KingsolverNo. 612All the Light We Cannot SeeAnthony Doerr-3A Gentleman in MoscowAmor Towles-4The GoldfinchDonna TarttNo. 465PachinkoMin Jin LeeNo. 156EducatedTara Westover-7Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and TomorrowGabrielle ZevinNo. 768My Brilliant FriendElena FerranteNo. 19Never Let Me GoKazuo IshiguroNo. 910Station ElevenEmily St. John MandelNo. 9311A Little LifeHanya Yanagihara-12The OverstoryRichard PowersNo. 2413The Underground RailroadColson WhiteheadNo. 714Wolf HallHilary MantelNo. 315The RoadCormac McCarthyNo. 1316Lincoln in the BardoGeorge SaundersNo. 1817AtonementIan McEwanNo. 2618MiddlesexJeffrey EugenidesNo. 5919AmericanahChimamanda Ngozi AdichieNo. 2720The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; ClayMichael ChabonNo. 1621HomegoingYaa Gyasi-22HamnetMaggie O’Farrell-23The Warmth of Other SunsIsabel WilkersonNo. 224Bel CantoAnn PatchettNo. 9825GileadMarilynne RobinsonNo. 1026The CorrectionsJonathan FranzenNo. 527Normal PeopleSally Rooney-28Cutting for StoneAbraham Verghese-29Say NothingPatrick Radden KeefeNo. 1930A Visit From the Goon SquadJennifer EganNo. 3931CirceMadeline Miller-32Cloud Cuckoo LandAnthony Doerr-33The Book ThiefMarkus Zusak-34Cloud AtlasDavid MitchellNo. 2835The Covenant of WaterAbraham Verghese-36The Year of Magical ThinkingJoan DidionNo. 1237The Nickel BoysColson Whitehead-38The Great BelieversRebecca MakkaiNo. 6439Olive KitteridgeElizabeth StroutNo. 7440The Kite RunnerKhaled Hosseini-41Life After LifeKate AtkinsonNo. 5142The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar WaoJunot DíazNo. 1143Between the World and MeTa-Nehisi CoatesNo. 3644The Heaven &amp; Earth Grocery StoreJames McBride-45There ThereTommy Orange-46The Song of AchillesMadeline Miller-47Lessons in ChemistryBonnie Garmus-48On Earth We’re Briefly GorgeousOcean Vuong-49Gone GirlGillian Flynn-50JamesPercival Everett-51CasteIsabel Wilkerson-52The NightingaleKristin Hannah-53TrustHernan DiazNo. 505411/22/63Stephen King-55Braiding SweetgrassRobin Wall Kimmerer-56The Hunger GamesSuzanne Collins-57Small Things Like TheseClaire KeeganNo. 4158White TeethZadie SmithNo. 3159Where the Crawdads SingDelia Owens-60The Dutch HouseAnn Patchett-61North WoodsDaniel Mason-62The SympathizerViet Thanh NguyenNo. 9063The Fifth SeasonN.K.

Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.\nOnce you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”\n~ Steve Jobs\n“If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life.

Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.\nSoftware Development, like other engineering disciplines, is fulfilling when executed within the frameworks of principles laid out by experts in the past. Choice of wrong architecture, wrong coding practices, even wrong names, give a lot of grief to people who have to debug production issues or maintain the systems. Many times, it is much simpler to rewrite the entire application than do patches on top of badly written software. While dealing with production issues is when one always wishes that people were better informed on basic principles and thought through things. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) and KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid) are principles that everyone should live by. The best practical guide to Software Development is surely Code Complete 2 by Steve McConnell.\nBooks with Lists\nAnyway, the top books with lists that I’d recommend are\n\nEffective Java by Joshua Bloch\n201 Principles of Software Development by Alan M. Davis\nProgramming Pearls by Jon Bentley\n55 Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering by Robert L. Glass\nDesign Patterns by GoF\n\n201 principles may have many principles that are dated, but many more are super relevant today. We’re now in the ‘no-code’ development age where a lot of user-facing applications get created by dragging and dropping widgets from a UI. Also a lot of boilerplate code is written by the machine. So, one would hope that the actual code itself is modularized, clean and easier to find troublesome spots. Maybe we’ll enter into a phase where people cannot write bad code. Like Java took away the memory management headache from simple-to-medium applications forever. One had to still think of garbage collection and JVM tuning for applications that handled millions of requests. But most people don’t operate in the ‘league of big wigs’ at all. (Haha, was about to say ‘league of big boys’!)\nA couple of years back, I’d asked DB, a senior executive that I respect a lot, to recommend a book based on his vast experience. He suggested reading any book by Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob). Yup, his books are great. Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Clean Coder are excellent reads and good reference materials.\nUber List\nHere is my uber list that I hope to revisit to update\n\nWorking Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers\nRefactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, 2nd Edition by Martin Fowler\nCode Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, 2nd Edition by Steve McConnell\nClean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin\nThe Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering by Frederick P. Brooks\nIntroduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein\nProgramming Pearls, 2nd Edition by Jon Bentley\nThe Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 2nd Edition by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt\nPeopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister\nDesign Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides\nRegular Expressions Cookbook 2nd Edition by Jan Goyvaerts, Steven Levithan\nCODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold\n\nI would have added the famous The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth but I haven’t read the series myself. Bill Gates himself mentioned this as an essential reading for programmers and it does figure in all the lists of great books on software development.\nThough I mentioned Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS above, the book is great as a reference and not for reading through fully in a short span of time. I’d really recommend Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou &amp; Vazirani or Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian &amp; Tom Griffiths or Tim Roughgarden’s Algorithm course on Coursera. Robert Sedgewick’s Algorithms is great if you’re looking for code in Java. One of my Graduate projects was in Rabin-Karp hashing algorithm and I relied entirely on the substring search section of the book. Sections 5.3 (substring search) and 5.5 (compression) are an excellent read for anyone who is new to those concepts.

Adler\nFull Title: How to Mark a Book\nCategory: articles\nSummary: In this article, Mortimer J. Adler argues that marking up a book is crucial to effective and active reading. He contends that marking a book is not an act of mutilation but of love, and that owning a book means making it a part of oneself. Adler suggests various ways to mark a book, such as underlining, circling, or writing in the margins, and emphasizes the benefits of doing so, including better understanding, memory retention, and engagement in a conversation with the author. Finally, he addresses potential objections to marking books, such as lending them to friends, and suggests solutions.\nURL: readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/wisereads/articles/how-to-mark-a-book/how-to-mark-a-book-1.pdf\n\nHighlights\n\nHaving a fine library doesn’t prove that its owner has a mind enriched by books; it proves nothing more than that he, his father, or his wife, was rich enough to buy them. (View Highlight)\nThere are three kinds of book owners. The first has all the standard sets and best sellers — unread, untouched. (This deluded individual owns woodpulp and ink, not books.) The second has a great many books — a few of them read through, most of them dipped into, but all of them as clean and shiny as the day they were bought. (This person would probably like to make books his own, but is restrained by a false respect for their physical appearance.) The third has a few books or many — every one of them dog-eared and dilapidated, shaken and loosened by continual use, marked and scribbled in from front to back. (This man owns books.) (View Highlight)\nWhy is marking up a book indispensable to reading? First, it keeps you awake. (And I don’t mean merely conscious; I mean awake.) In the second place; reading, if it is active, is thinking, and thinking tends to express itself in words, spoken or written. The marked book is usually the thought-through book. Finally, writing helps you remember the thoughts you had, or the thoughts the author expressed. (View Highlight)\nUnderstanding is a two-way operation; learning doesn’t consist in being an empty receptacle. The learner has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has to argue with the teacher, once he understands what the teacher is saying. And marking a book is literally an expression of differences, or agreements of opinion, with the author. (View Highlight)\nSome things should be read quickly and effortlessly and some should be read slowly and even laboriously. The sign of intelligence in reading is the ability to read different things differently according to their worth.

He emphasizes that a good human possesses an excellent soul, which is characterized by clear intellect and noble character. Aristotle identifies virtues related to intellect, such as art, intelligence, scientific knowledge, prudence, and wisdom, as well as virtues of noble character like courage and temperance. He suggests that a good life involves virtuous actions developed through study and habit, leading to a fulfilled and flourishing life based on excellence rather than mere pleasure. Happiness, according to Aristotle, comes from pursuing virtue and aligning with one’s nature as a human with a clear intellect and noble character.\nURL: ralphammer.com/aristotle-how-to-live-a-good-life/\n\nHighlights\n\nA good thing fulfils its unique function. (View Highlight)\nArt (techne) is the ability to make things. (View Highlight)\nIntelligence (nous) is intuitive insight into underlying truths of our world.

Whatever you believe about how best to learn for you is probably incorrect. Most of what we believe about the best ways to study are absolutely false.\n\n\nUnderstanding Neuroplasticity\n\nNeuroplasticity is the incredible feature of your nervous system which allows it to change in response to experience. Any form of learning involves neuroplasticity. At the cellular level, neuroplasticity generally involves three different mechanisms:\n\nStrengthening of certain connections between neurons\nWeakening of connections between neurons\nNeurogenesis (addition of new neurons) - though this is rare in adult human brains\n\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Focus and Alertness\n\nTo learn effectively, you need to be alert and focused. This is a prerequisite for learning. The process of being focused and attending cues your nervous system that something is important.\n\n\nSleep: The Foundation of Learning\n\nGetting a great night’s sleep is crucial for learning. Your ability to be alert and focused will be greater if you slept well the night before.\n\n\nActive Engagement in Learning\n\nDon’t be a passive participant in learning. Engage your attention and focus voluntarily. Force yourself to attend and focus on the material you’re trying to learn.\n\n\nTools for Improving Focus\n\nMindfulness Meditation: Doing a brief 5-10 minute mindfulness meditation each day can improve your level of focus, memory, and recall ability.\nFocusing Perceptual Exercise: Focus on a visual target, allowing yourself to blink, and make sure your visual and cognitive attention comes back to that visual target over and over again.\n\n\nThe Two-Step Process of Learning\n\nActive engagement (focus and alertness) during exposure to new information\nConsolidation during sleep and sleep-like states\n\n\nTesting as a Learning Tool\n\nOne of the most effective ways to study and learn is through testing. Testing is not just a way of evaluating what knowledge you’ve acquired, but also turns out to be the best tool for offsetting forgetting of any kind.\n\n\nThe Power of Self-Testing\nStudies have shown that testing yourself on material soon after learning it can significantly improve retention. In fact, testing yourself once on new material can improve retention by about 50% compared to not testing yourself at all.\nBest Practices for Self-Testing\n\nUse open-ended, short-answer questions rather than multiple-choice tests.\nTest yourself very soon (same day or next day) after being exposed to new material.\nDon’t worry about getting answers wrong - recognizing errors in your information retention is another critical way to retain more information.\n\n\nThe Role of Emotion in Learning\n\nEmotionally laden experiences are remembered more durably. This is why stressful or highly positive experiences can lead to “one-trial learning.”\n\n\nInterleaving Information\n\nInterleaving refers to the practice of mixing in related but not directly relevant information during the learning process.\n\n\n"},"Readwise/Articles/2024/2024-08-26---Smith---At-Least-Five-Interesting-Things-to-Start-Your-Week":{"slug":"Readwise/Articles/2024/2024-08-26---Smith---At-Least-Five-Interesting-Things-to-Start-Your-Week","filePath":"Readwise/Articles/2024/2024-08-26 - Smith - At Least Five Interesting Things to Start Your Week.md","title":"2024-08-26 - Smith - At Least Five Interesting Things to Start Your Week","links":["General-Notes/People/Authors/Substack/Noah-Smith","tags/articles"],"tags":["articles"],"content":"At Least Five Interesting Things to Start Your Week\nMetadata\n\nAuthor: Noah Smith\nFull Title: At Least Five Interesting Things to Start Your Week\nCategory: articles\nSummary: The article discusses the increasing challenges faced by the U.S. government, particularly regarding rising national debt and healthcare costs.

No matter how strong we feel, we need relationships that nurture and sustain our strength throughout our lives. (View Highlight)\nthe key to healthy ageing is relationships, relationships, relationships.” (View Highlight)\nthe cornerstone of a rich friendship is forgiveness and mercy. Friends stand tall and close to each other, especially during each other’s vulnerabilities, being present and forgiving to each other no matter the circumstances. (View Highlight)\n“Friendship is a mirror to presence and a testament to forgiveness. Friendship not only helps us see ourselves through another’s eyes but can be sustained over the years only with someone who has repeatedly forgiven us for our trespasses as we must find it in ourselves to forgive them in turn. A friend knows our difficulties and shadows and remains in sight, a companion to our vulnerabilities more than our triumphs, when we are under the strange illusion that we do not need them. An undercurrent of real friendship is a blessing exactly because its elemental form is rediscovered again and again through understanding and mercy. All friendships of any length are based on a continued, mutual forgiveness. Without tolerance and mercy, all friendships die.” (View Highlight)\nFriendship is a lens through which we see the goodness and future possibilities—the best self in others as they do likewise. (View Highlight)\n“In the course of the years, a close friendship will always reveal the shadow in the other as much as ourselves. To remain friends, we must know the other and their difficulties and even their sins and encourage the best in them, not through critique but through addressing the better part of them, the leading creative edge of their incarnation, thus subtly discouraging what makes them smaller, less generous, less of themselves. Through the eyes of a real friendship, an individual is larger than their everyday actions, and through the eyes of another, we receive a greater sense of our own personhood, one we can aspire to, the one in whom they have most faith. Friendship is a moving frontier of understanding not only of the self and the other but also, of a possible and as yet unlived, future.” (View Highlight)\nWithout friendship, our relationships are doomed to fail. (View Highlight)\n“Friendship is the great hidden transmuter of all relationship: it can transform a troubled marriage, make honorable a professional rivalry, make sense of heartbreak and unrequited love and become the newly discovered ground for a mature parent-child relationship. The dynamic of friendship is almost always underestimated as a constant force in human life: a diminishing circle of friends is the first terrible diagnostic of a life in deep trouble: of overwork, of too much emphasis on a professional identity, of forgetting who will be there when our armored personalities run into the inevitable natural disasters and vulnerabilities found in even the most average existence.” (View Highlight)\nEven in death, a good friendship continues. Past conversations and memories remain like guideposts to us. We talk to them as if talking to ourselves. They stay somewhere in the ether, checking in on our lives. (View Highlight)\n“No matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self, the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.” (View Highlight)\n"},"Readwise/Articles/2024/2024-09-05---Potter---Why-Can't-the-U.S.-Build-Ships":{"slug":"Readwise/Articles/2024/2024-09-05---Potter---Why-Can't-the-U.S.-Build-Ships","filePath":"Readwise/Articles/2024/2024-09-05 - Potter - Why Can't the U.S. Build Ships.md","title":"2024-09-05 - Potter - Why Can't the U.S. Build Ships","links":["Brian-Potter","tags/articles"],"tags":["articles"],"content":"Why Can’t the U.S. Build Ships?\nMetadata\n\nAuthor: Brian Potter\nFull Title: Why Can’t the U.S. Build Ships?\nCategory: articles\nSummary: The U.S. has a very small commercial shipbuilding industry, constructing only five oceangoing ships in 2022 compared to thousands built by countries like China and South Korea.

True faith is open to mystery, wonder, and the idea that our beliefs should be re-examined. Embracing doubt allows us to remain receptive to the divine rather than reducing God to rigid dogma.\nURL: kerrywalters.substack.com/p/the-gift-of-doubt\n\nHighlights\n\nMany people believe that doubt is a deal breaker when it comes to religious faith. As they see it, persons of genuine faith are rock-solidly certain in their beliefs about God and God’s ways, no matter how unlikely, irrational, or even harmful those beliefs may strike others. For them, doubt is a crack in the tower of faith that, unattended, brings everything crashing down. (View Highlight)\nAt its deepest level, faith isn’t an uncritical swallowing of this or that religious claim. Instead, it’s an attitude of radical openness, wonder, awe, trust, and gratitude, grounded in the intuition that there exists an ultimate reality we can call “God,” and that this reality is benevolent rather than indifferent or hostile. (View Highlight)\nThomas Aquinas, surely one of the most orthodox thinkers of all time, cautioned that anything we say about God is necessarily analogous, not descriptive. When it comes to God, he said, our language simply doesn’t stretch far enough. God is unwordable Mystery. (View Highlight)\nThe trouble is that many of us resist uncertainty when it comes to religious beliefs, even if that means repudiating the ultimately indescribable experiences that awakened us to God in the first place. We substitute dogma for wonder, ritual for gratitude, and placation for trust. (View Highlight)\nDoubt is the daughter of humility, of the chastened awareness that no finite human mind is capable of fully knowing God or of making definitive, once-for-all pronouncements about the Divine. Doubt is receptivity to the always surprising adventure of God.

This is so, I hasten to add, whether we are patients or psychoanalysts.” (View Highlight)\nChange requires both risk and effort.

And finally, you need personnel quality — you need to have public servants who are both intelligent and highly dedicated to the work.

This change reveals themes of self-deception and human failing, as Timon grapples with his own misguided ideals of generosity. Ultimately, Timon’s story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of bad faith and the fragility of human relationships.\nURL: kerrywalters.substack.com/p/what-art-thou-speak\n\nHighlights\n\nTimon gives freely with no thought of recompense, and just naturally expects everyone to be as open-heartedly generous as he is. That’s why the refusal of his so-called friends to help him in his moment of need shatters his innocent optimism. (View Highlight)\nBad faith, or mauvaise foi, is essentially a form of self-deception. When we fall into it, we deny one aspect of what it means to be a person by overemphazing another. We lock ourselves into an inauthentic or false identity. (View Highlight)\nAccording to Sartre, a human is a combination of fact and freedom. Each of us is born into a specific temporal and spatial context and endowed with a biologically determined set of strengths and weaknesses. (View Highlight)\nWe deny our freedom by convincing ourselves that we’re nothing but facticity, thereby trying to freeze our identity into an object-like permanence (View Highlight)\nBut trying to become an unchangeable object by focusing on facticity is only one of two ways in which bad faith can occur. The other is by self-identifying as an utterly transcendent being liberated from historical and biological constraints—a kind of free-floating gnosticism (View Highlight)\nBut because they’re so invested in the false identities they’ve created for themselves, they resist the self-reflection necessary to root out the interior source of their disquiet. (View Highlight)\nProjection is bad faith’s go-to defense mechanism. (View Highlight)\nIn the first half of the play, Timon’s bad faith is of the denying facticity variety. He refuses to acknowledge the material fact that he’s squandering his fortune, (View Highlight)\ngift-giving is an inherently impossible act—what he calls an aporia—because there’s always a circle of exchange in which the giver is rewarded for her gift-giving (View Highlight)\n“The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends.” (View Highlight)\nFirst Timon was superior to material considerations, a disincarnate paragon of generosity: pure freedom.

(View Highlight)\nGood institutions also include things like common understandings in a place or industry about business agreements; courts that hear cases promptly and resolve them consistently; and a political environment in which the powerful do not meddle arbitrarily with exchange. (View Highlight)\nIn the absence of secure property rights, individuals have poor incentives to invest in land, capital and technology—e.g., due to fears of expropriation. This ultimately results in fewer productive enterprises and lower income levels. (View Highlight)\nWhen businesses can trust that their contracts will be honored, that disputes can be resolved fairly, and that the laws governing their trade are predictable, they are more likely to engage in transactions and invest in long-term partnerships. (View Highlight)\nThe takeaway is that when courts work efficiently, they don’t just resolve disputes—they create an environment where businesses can confidently forge partnerships, specialize, and innovate.

Ultimately, the story suggests that God’s presence can be felt in many forms, much like the ripples in a deep river.\nURL: kerrywalters.substack.com/p/the-many-faces-of-god\n\nHighlights\n\nthe central archetypes of the Christian story—Conversion, Forgiveness, Sacrifice, Resurrection, and Compassion—had such deep metaphysical and psychological roots that they emerge, again and again, even in persons and cultures indifferent to or outright hostile to Christianity. (View Highlight)\nThe five characters are expressions of Shusaku’s conviction that the pull of Christian archetypes is felt even by nonreligious persons. In Isobe’s case, it’s Resurrection; in Numada’s, Sacrifice; in Kiguchi’s, Forgiveness; in Mitsuko’s, Conversion; and in Otsu’s, Compassion. (View Highlight)\nThe ritual of freeing the myna is a gesture of thanks for being snatched from death by the sacrifice of a loving companion.

I think he is also among the Jews and the Buddhists and the Hindus.” (View Highlight)\nAnd just as with Jesus, the particular manifestation of God to whom he is devoted, Otsu’s compassion eventually costs his life. He’s beaten to death, like a sacrificial “bleating lamb” (p. 212) by a riotous crowd as he tries to save the life of another man from its fury. Like the Lord he serves, Otsu dies a Suffering, because Compassionate, Servant.

There are as many manifestations of God as there are ripples in the water, and all of them sparkle with vitality.

So my plan is simple: write often, read more, and slowly improve until I reach a point where I can be proud of my work.” (View Highlight)\nShipping isn’t the same as finishing code. According to GitHub engineer Sean Goedecke, successfully shipping requires a different set of skills. “No matter the project goal, your leadership team (the people in your reporting chain who care about the project) will always have basically zero technical context about the project compared to you. That means they will be trusting you for estimates, to answer technical questions, and to anticipate technical problems. Maintaining that trust should be your top priority.” (View Highlight)\nStop asking anybody, ‘What should I do?‘… We want these kinds of answers from people we consider smart or more successful or whatever label you want to put on it.

Broad tariffs can raise costs for U.S. companies while making foreign products cheaper, which limits their effectiveness in reducing trade deficits.

Despite their guilt, many people today empathize with them, viewing them as victims rather than criminals. This case highlights how excessive empathy can cloud judgment and lead to misguided perceptions of justice.\nURL: www.gurwinder.blog/p/how-empathy-makes-us-cruel-and-crazy\n\nHighlights\n\nThe most important of these myths is “blank-slatism”, a model of people as “blank slates” who have little to no inherent nature, but are shaped largely by culture. Under this view, people only become criminals due to negative experiences such as abuse or poverty, so a core part of any criminal case becomes identifying the trauma that produced the criminal. This is a seductive view for social scientists because it means anyone can be “fixed” through exposure to the right environment. Further, this view encourages empathy because it’s easier and more rational to empathize with others if we’re all fundamentally the same person, differentiated only by experience.\nThe trouble is, we’re not. Blank-slatism has been resoundingly disproven by decades of twin studies. It’s also disproven by common sense; (View Highlight)\nEmpathy is an act of opening ourselves up to the feelings of others, and in doing so, we become vulnerable to feelings that can cloud our judgment. If we identify too strongly with someone, our emotional connection to them can cause us to behave like their lawyers, engaging in mental gymnastics to defend our idealized image of them. (View Highlight)\nEmpathy produces fiction in the mind because it’s ultimately a form of imagination. The fact that movies and literature can easily make us empathize with fictional characters shows how easily our empathy can be hacked. (View Highlight)\nthose who empathize with one side’s pain often wish to inflict even greater pain on the other. One might even say empathy is a major cause of sadism in the world. (View Highlight)\nempathy doesn’t work as a moral or judicial guide. Far from making us good, it makes us gullible, biased, dishonest, cruel, and unjust. If we wish to know who’s right and wrong, guilty and innocent, we should spend less time trying to inhabit other people’s heads, and make more use of our own.

There is no principle of human morality or justice that says they should have to. Instead, it’s purely the law of the jungle; there are predators in this world, and they will conquer what they can until they are stopped. China’s leaders want to conquer Taiwan not just because they want to rival the old Qing dynasty in territorial extent, but because Taiwan represents something to them that they can’t abide — an alternative blueprint for Asia. Perhaps even more than Japan or South Korea, Taiwan shows people in China and its satellite states what they’re missing — a way of life where people can just be themselves, instead of living in service to a grand empire.

Imagine AI tutors personalizing education for each child, researchers rapidly discovering cures for diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer, and AI advisors empowering people to navigate complex systems and achieve their goals. Hoffman and co-author, tech and culture writer Greg Beato envision a world where these possibilities, and many more, become a reality.

This interpretation suggests that God is inviting Abraham to recognize the blessings in his life rather than imposing a cruel order.

A degree of mutual respect and trust is implied. (View Highlight)\nIf we interpret the Akedah as a command, God’s “test” of Abraham seems cruelly harsh. But if we read it as God making a request, the upshot is something like this. “I’m asking you, Abraham,” says God, “if you’re willing to choose me above everything and anyone else. Once you make that interior commitment”— the leap of faith, as Kierkegaard would say—“you’ll see the world and everything in it—including yourself and your loved ones—in an entirely different light.

Gather Context and Background: - Include all relevant background information, definitions, and data. - Specify any boundaries (e.g., scope, timeframes, geographic limits). Use Specific and Clear Language: - Provide precise wording and define key terms. - Avoid vague or ambiguous language. Provide Step-by-Step Guidance: - Break the task into sequential steps or sub-tasks. - Organize instructions using bullet points or numbered lists. Specify the Desired Output Format: - Describe how the final answer should be organized (e.g., report format, headings, bullet points, citations). Include any specific formatting requirements. Balance Detail with Flexibility: - Offer sufficient detail to guide the response while allowing room for creative elaboration. - Avoid over-constraining the prompt to enable exploration of relevant nuances. Incorporate Iterative Refinement: - Build in a process to test the prompt and refine it based on initial outputs. - Allow for follow-up instructions to adjust or expand the response as needed. Apply Proven Techniques: - Use methods such as chain-of-thought prompting (e.g., “think step by step”) for complex tasks. - Encourage the AI to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps. Set a Role or Perspective: - Assign a specific role (e.g., “act as a market analyst” or “assume the perspective of a historian”) to tailor the tone and depth of the analysis. Avoid Overloading the Prompt: - Focus on one primary objective or break multiple questions into separate parts. - Prevent overwhelming the prompt with too many distinct questions. Request Justification and References: - Instruct the AI to support its claims with evidence or to reference sources where possible. - Enhance the credibility and verifiability of the response. Review and Edit Thoroughly: - Ensure the final prompt is clear, logically organized, and complete. - Remove any ambiguous or redundant instructions."},"Readwise/Articles/2025-02-23---Smith---Only-Fools-Think-Elon-Is-Incompetent":{"slug":"Readwise/Articles/2025-02-23---Smith---Only-Fools-Think-Elon-Is-Incompetent","filePath":"Readwise/Articles/2025-02-23 - Smith - Only Fools Think Elon Is Incompetent.md","title":"2025-02-23 - Smith - Only Fools Think Elon Is Incompetent","links":["General-Notes/People/Authors/Substack/Noah-Smith","tags/articles"],"tags":["articles"],"content":"Only Fools Think Elon Is Incompetent - Readwise Highlights\nMetadata\n\nAuthor: Noah Smith\nFull Title: Only Fools Think Elon Is Incompetent\nCategory: articles\nSummary: Elon Musk is highly intelligent and has accomplished remarkable feats in business, like building SpaceX and Tesla.

They’re the type to say, “I’ll figure it out,” and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next.\nIt’s not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap.

There are people for whom greed, selfishness, and cruelty are not occasional lapses, but a way of life. There are true villains in this world. Everyone knows this on some level, and we’ve organized large parts of our societies around trying to police the true villains and keep them from attaining power. But society is always at a disadvantage, because villains work around the clock; people who crave power and dominance spend all of their waking hours trying to get it, while normal, flawed people can only spend part of their time policing them. (View Highlight)\nAnd the villains have a lot of practice using normal people’s flaws to divide them.

God hates death. Death is an unnatural force to be defeated? Or it may also be that people should not be so saddened at someone’s death. Jesus is moved by Mary’s sadness.

(Location 87)\nCompletely passive reading is impossible; we cannot read with our eyes immobilized and our minds asleep. (Location 101)\nThus we can roughly define what we mean by the art of reading as follows: the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside,I elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. (Location 146)\nTo be informed is to know simply that something is the case.

(Location 2295)\ne. Successful people are those who can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to shape change. (Location 2298)\nf. Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn’t be doing. (Location 2324)\ng. Because it is difficult to see oneself objectively, you need to rely on the input of others and the whole body of evidence. (Location 2326)\nh. If you are open-minded enough and determined, you can get virtually anything you want. (Location 2330)\n1. Don’t confuse what you wish were true with what is really true. 2. Don’t worry about looking good—worry instead about achieving your goals. 3. Don’t overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third-order ones. 4. Don’t let pain stand in the way of progress. 5. Don’t blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.

(Location 195)\nbusiness enterprise is a system of the highest order: a system the parts of which are human beings contributing voluntarily of their knowledge, skill, and dedication to a joint venture. (Location 231)\nOrganizations that exhibit a high spirit of performance are led by managers who are committed to doing the right thing and to getting the right things done. (Location 243)\nmanagers will have to focus much more attention on making knowledge-work productive and knowledge-workers achieving. This requires attention to building on strengths and to increasing the productivity of knowledge workers, but also to integrating these specialists into a performing whole. This integration of specialists is becoming the very essence of management in knowledge societies. (Location 277)\nThe ethical rule that managers should live by when pursuing their organization’s mission is primum non nocere: “above all, not knowingly to do harm.” (Location 286)\nInstitutions are organs of society. As such, they are significantly dependent upon the welfare of society for their own welfare. (Location 301)\nManagement effectiveness requires three interconnected skills and practices, (Location 338)\nSpecific skills managers must acquire to be effective as leaders (Location 339)\nParticular tasks that managers must perform (Location 340)\nto lead their organizations to effectiveness Personal skills and practices that make individuals effective both in life and in managerial practice (Location 340)\nmanagers must acquire skills in six areas: (Location 343)\nDecision making People decisions Communications Budgeting Measurement and controls Information literacy (Location 344)\nThere are six steps of effective decision making and five characteristics of effective decisions. (Location 346)\nIt is much easier to fix a wrong solution to a problem if the problem has been defined correctly than it is to fix a “correct” solution to a problem that has been defined incorrectly. If a problem has been defined incorrectly, no solution to that problem can be found. (Location 347)\nThere are five steps in making effective people decisions: (Location 371)\nAccept responsibility for any people decision you make, such as placement or promotion that fails. (Location 376)\nFinally and most fundamentally, it is the manager’s responsibility to try to make the right people decision every time. (Location 379)\nThe five tasks of the manager are aimed at implementing the Theory of the Business. (Location 414)\nCommunication—upward, downward, and sideways—is essential to setting and accomplishing objectives. (Location 423)\nIt rests on a high concept of human motivation and behavior. It is the underpinning for a highly-spirited organization. (Location 427)\nThe organization’s structure should allow decisions to be made at the lowest level possible, consistent with minimizing the number of people that must be consulted to make each decision. (Location 431)\nTo ensure that efforts in the organization are directed toward objectives, a manager must establish yardsticks of performance. (Location 438)\nManagers must also take responsibility for developing the abilities of subordinates and coworkers around them. This is a key result area for the manager. (Location 444)\nthe life expectancy of the employing institution has been going down, and is likely to keep going down. (Location 483)\nSuccessfully managing a business meant being able to produce the same commodities everybody else produced but at lower cost. (Location 523)\n“Generalists”—and this is what the traditional business enterprise, including the Japanese companies, tried to develop—are of limited use in a knowledge economy. In fact, they are productive only if they themselves become specialists in managing knowledge and knowledge workers. (Location 533)\nThere is as a consequence only one satisfactory definition of management, whether we talk of a business, a government agency, or a nonprofit organization: to make human resources productive. (Location 549)\nThey are what holds it together and makes it work. None of our institutions could function without managers. (Location 586)\nmanagement precedes and even outranks ownership. (Location 596)\nWhen a variety of tasks all have to be performed in cooperation, synchronization, and communication, an organization needs managers and management. (Location 612)\nWithout the institution, there would be no management. But without management, there would be only a mob rather than an institution. (Location 625)\nOrgans, however, are never defined by what they do, let alone by how they do it. They are defined by their contribution. And it is management that enables the institution to contribute. (Location 627)\nThe emphasis is still on power and authority rather than on responsibility and contribution. (Location 674)\none can divide the work of a manager into planning, organizing, integrating, measuring, and developing people. (Location 677)\nIt would, therefore, seem appropriate to stress that the first criterion in identifying those people within an organization who have management responsibility is not command over people. It is responsibility for contribution. Function rather than power has to be the distinctive criterion and the organizing principle. (Location 694)\nA manager, in the first place, sets objectives. He or she determines what the objectives should be. She determines what the goals in each area of objective should be. She decides what has to be done to reach these objectives. She makes the objectives effective by communicating them to the people whose performance is needed to attain them. (Location 718)\nSecond, a manager organizes. He or she analyses the activities, decisions, and relations needed. He classifies the work. He divides it into manageable activities and further divides the activities into manageable jobs. He groups these units and jobs into an organization structure. He or she selects people for the management of these units and for the jobs to be done. (Location 721)\nThird, a manager motivates and communicates. He makes a team out of the people that are responsible for various jobs. He does that in his own relations to the people with whom he works. He does it through his “people decisions” on pay, placement, and promotion. And he does it through constant communication, to and from his subordinates, and to and from his superior, and to and from his colleagues. This is the manager’s integrating function. (Location 723)\nThe fourth basic element in the work of the manager is measurement. The manager establishes targets and yardsticks—and few factors are as important to the performance of the organization and of every person in it. (Location 727)\nFifth, and finally, a manager develops people, including himself or herself. This task, which in this age of knowledge takes on even greater importance, occupies an entire section in this book. (Location 731)\nOrganizing, too, requires analytical ability. For it demands the most economical use of scarce resources. (Location 737)\nAs long as measurements are abused as a tool of control, measuring will remain the weakest area in the manager’s performance. (Location 745)\nSetting objectives, organizing, motivating and communicating, measuring, and developing people are formal, classifying categories. Only a manager’s experience can bring them to life and make them concrete and meaningful. (Location 746)\n“Working” with the human being always means developing him or her. (Location 755)\ndeveloping people still requires a basic quality in the manager that cannot be created by supplying skills or by emphasizing the importance of the task. It requires integrity of character. (Location 763)\nIn every successful organization there are bosses who do not like people, who do not help them, and who do not get along with them. Cold, unpleasant, demanding, they often teach and develop more people than anyone else. They command more respect than the most likable person ever could. They demand exacting workmanship of themselves and other people. They set high standards and expect that they will be lived up to. They consider only what is right and never who is right. And though often themselves persons of brilliance, they never rate intellectual brilliance above integrity in others. The manager who lacks these qualities of character—no matter how likable, helpful, or amiable, no matter, even, how competent or brilliant—is a menace who is unfit to be a manager. (Location 765)\nWhat a manager does can be analyzed systematically. What a manager has to be able to do can be learned. (Location 771)\nThe performance and the survival of the institution depend on the performance of management. (Location 777)\nthe ultimate test of management is performance. Achievement rather than knowledge remains, of necessity, both aim and proof. (Location 792)\nHumanity can only adapt. It can, at best, optimize what the economy makes possible; at worst, it impedes the forces of the economy and wastes resources. (Location 830)\nHe saw in management, rather than in economic forces, the engine of economic and social development; (Location 845)\nResponsibility for contribution, rather than rank or title or command over people, defines the manager. And integrity rather than genius is the manager’s basic requirement. (Location 920)\nTo be sure, the fundamental task of management remains the same: to make people capable of joint performance through common goals, common values, the right structure, and the training and development they need to perform and to respond to change. (Location 936)\nManagement explains why, for the first time in human history, we can employ large numbers of knowledgeable, skilled people in productive work. (Location 944)\nThey concluded that the assembly line was a short-term compromise. Despite its tremendous productivity, it was poor economics because of its inflexibility, poor use of human resources, even poor engineering. (Location 983)\nEvery one of these managerial innovations represented the application of knowledge to work—the substitution of system and information for guesswork, brawn, and toil. (Location 986)\n\nTags: favorite\n\n\nNot to innovate is the single largest reason for the decline of existing organizations. Not to know how to manage is the single largest reason for the failure of new ventures. (Location 1007)\nManagement—and not only in the business enterprise—has to be accountable for performance. (Location 1030)\nManagement’s first job is to think through, set, and exemplify those objectives, values, and goals. (Location 1050)\nFinally, the single most important thing to remember about any enterprise is that results exist only on the outside. (Location 1063)\nManagement is thus what tradition used to call a liberal art: “liberal” because it deals with the fundamentals of knowledge, self-knowledge, wisdom, and leadership; “art” because it is practice and application.

The school exists not for the sake of teachers, but for the students.

Drucker\nFull Title: The Effective Executive\nCategory: books\n\nHighlights\n\n“That one can truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven,” Drucker writes. “But one can always manage oneself.” (Location 196)\nThe ratio of a leader’s performance to those on his or her team remains constant; therefore, if you want the average performance of those around you to go up, you must first improve your own performance. (Location 198)\n“To focus on weakness is not only foolish; it is irresponsible,” (Location 203)\nyou must address deficiencies that directly impede full flowering of your strength. (Location 206)\nSome people work well at night; others work better in the morning. Some absorb information best by reading, others by listening. Some thrive in full immersion; others work better in short bursts with variety in the day. Some are project oriented; others are process oriented. Some need vacations; others think the best part about vacations is that they end. Some prefer teams, whereas others produce much greater impact working alone. Per Drucker, we are wired for ways of working in the same way we are right-handed or left-handed. (Location 212)\nwhat gets measured gets managed. (Location 219)\nmake your time count. The “secret” of people who do so many difficult things, writes Drucker, is that they do only one thing at a time; they refuse to let themselves be squandered away in “small driblets [that] are no time at all.” (Location 223)\nFirst, create unbroken blocks for individual think time, preferably during the most lucid time of day; these pockets of quietude might be only ninety minutes, but even the busiest executive must do them with regularity. Second, create chunks of deliberately unstructured time for people and the inevitable stuff that comes up. Third, engage in meetings that matter, making particular use of carefully constructed standing meetings that can be the heartbeat of dialogue, debate, and decision; and use some of your think time to prepare and follow up.

Get better people, give them really big things to do, enlarge their responsibilities, and let them work. (Location 267)\nHow can we make society both more productive and more humane?

But that is the wrong question.” He paused, then like the Zen master thwacking the table with a bamboo stick: “The question is: how to be useful!” (Location 285)\nThat one can truly manage other people is by no means adequately proven. But one can always manage oneself. (Location 296)\nManagement is largely by example. Executives who do not know how to make themselves effective in their own job and work set the wrong example. (Location 297)\nEffectiveness is what executives are being paid for, whether they work as managers who are responsible for the performance of others as well as their own, or as individual professional contributors responsible for their own performance only. Without effectiveness there is no “performance,” no matter how much intelligence and knowledge goes into the work, no matter how many hours it (Location 307)\nThey asked, “What needs to be done?”             • They asked, “What is right for the enterprise?”             • They developed action plans.             • They took responsibility for decisions.             • They took responsibility for communicating.             • They were focused on opportunities rather than problems.             • They ran productive meetings.             • They thought and said “we” rather than “I.” (Location 329)\nKnowledge is useless to executives until it has been translated into deeds.

(Location 160)\nPotential is not a matter of where you start, but of how far you travel. We need to focus less on starting points and more on distance traveled. (Location 166)\nPeople who make major strides are rarely freaks of nature. They’re usually freaks of nurture. (Location 169)\nambition is the outcome you want to attain. Aspiration is the person you hope to become. (Location 176)\nCharacter is more than just having principles. It’s a learned capacity to live by your principles. (Location 219)\nThe true measure of your potential is not the height of the peak you’ve reached, but how far you’ve climbed to get there. (Location 340)\nCharacter is your capacity to prioritize your values over your instincts. (Location 364)\nIf personality is how you respond on a typical day, character is how you show up on a hard day. (Location 366)\nTraveling great distances requires the courage to seek out the right kinds of discomfort, the capacity to absorb the right information, and the will to accept the right imperfections. (Location 389)\nBecoming a creature of discomfort can unlock hidden potential in many different types of learning. Summoning the nerve to face discomfort is a character skill—an especially important form of determination. It takes three kinds of courage: to abandon your tried-and-true methods, to put yourself in the ring before you feel ready, and to make more mistakes than others make attempts. The best way to accelerate growth is to embrace, seek, and amplify discomfort. (Location 441)\nplaying only to your strengths deprives you of the opportunity to improve on your weaknesses. (Location 468)\nYou don’t have to wait until you’ve acquired an entire library of knowledge to start to communicate. Your mental library expands as you communicate. (Location 567)\nBeing polite is withholding feedback to make someone feel good today. Being kind is being candid about how they can get better tomorrow. (Location 810)\nIt’s easy for people to be critics or cheerleaders. It’s harder to get them to be coaches. A critic sees your weaknesses and attacks your worst self. A cheerleader sees your strengths and celebrates your best self. A coach sees your potential and helps you become a better version of yourself. (Location 821)\nInstead of seeking feedback, you’re better off asking for advice. Feedback tends to focus on how well you did last time. Advice shifts attention to how you can do better next time. (Location 825)\nBeing a sponge is not only a proactive skill—it’s a prosocial skill. Done right, it’s not just about soaking up nutrients that help us grow. It’s also about releasing nutrients to help others grow. (Location 886)\nPerfectionists excel at solving problems that are straightforward and familiar. (Location 956)\nIn their quest for flawless results, research suggests that perfectionists tend to get three things wrong. One: they obsess about details that don’t matter. They’re so busy finding the right solution to tiny problems that they lack the discipline to find the right problems to solve. They can’t see the forest for the trees. Two: they avoid unfamiliar situations and difficult tasks that might lead to failure. That leaves them refining a narrow set of existing skills rather than working to develop new ones. Three: they berate themselves for making mistakes, which makes it harder to learn from them. They fail to realize that the purpose of reviewing your mistakes isn’t to shame your past self. It’s to educate your future self. (Location 969)\nExpectations tend to rise with accomplishment. The better you’re performing, the more you demand of yourself and the less you notice incremental gains. Appreciating progress depends on remembering how your past self would see your current achievements. (Location 1063)\nwhen people assess your skills, they put more weight on your peaks than on your troughs. (Location 1073)\nPeople judge your potential from your best moments, not your worst. (Location 1077)\nUltimately, excellence is more than meeting other people’s expectations. It’s also about living up to your own standards. After all, it’s impossible to please everyone. The question is whether you’re letting down the right people. It’s better to disappoint others than to disappoint yourself. (Location 1146)\nthe best way to unlock hidden potential isn’t to suffer through the daily grind. It’s to transform the daily grind into a source of daily joy. (Location 1244)\nIt’s not a coincidence that in music, the term for practice is play. (Location 1245)\nHarmonious passion is taking joy in a process rather than feeling pressure to achieve an outcome. You’re no longer practicing under the specter of should. (Location 1271)\nresearch suggests that the people with the most discipline actually use the least amount of it. (Location 1371)\nRelaxing is not a waste of time—it’s an investment in well-being. (Location 1449)\nA rut is not a sign that you’ve tanked. A plateau is not a cue that you’ve peaked. They’re signals that it may be time to turn around and find a new route. (Location 1503)\nEven if your chosen expert can walk you through their route, when you ask for directions on yours, you’ll run into a second challenge. You don’t share the same strengths and weaknesses—their hills and valleys aren’t the same as yours. You might be heading for the same destination, but you’re starting far from their position. This makes your path as unfamiliar to them as theirs is to you. (Location 1625)\nWeak leaders silence voice and shoot the messenger. Strong leaders welcome voice and thank the messenger. (Location 2698)\nWhen we confuse past performance with future potential, we miss out on people whose achievements have involved overcoming major obstacles. (Location 2772)\nIt’s often said that talent sets the floor, but character sets the ceiling. (Location 2824)\nYet when we judge potential, we often focus on execution and ignore degree of difficulty.

(Location 103)\nOur tendency to summon powers we cannot control stems not from individual psychology but from the unique way our species cooperates in large numbers. (Location 108)\nThe main argument of this book is that humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation, but the way these networks are built predisposes us to use that power unwisely. Our problem, then, is a network problem. (Location 109)\nEven more specifically, it is an information problem. Information is the glue that holds networks together. But for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens built and maintained large networks by inventing and spreading fictions, fantasies, and mass delusions—about gods, about enchanted broomsticks, about AI, and about a great many other things. While each individual human is typically interested in knowing the truth about themselves and the world, large networks bind members and create order by relying on fictions and fantasies. (Location 111)\nWe should not assume that delusional networks are doomed to failure. If we want to prevent their triumph, we will have to do the hard work ourselves. (Location 123)\nThe naive view argues that by gathering and processing much more information than individuals can, big networks achieve a better understanding of medicine, physics, economics, and numerous other fields, which makes the network not only powerful but also wise. (Location 128)\nThis view posits that in sufficient quantities information leads to truth, and truth in turn leads to both power and wisdom. Ignorance, in contrast, seems to lead nowhere. (Location 132)\nHowever, the naive view assumes that the antidote to most problems we encounter in gathering and processing information is gathering and processing even more information. While we are never completely safe from error, in most cases more information means greater accuracy.

We have a moral imperative to realize this promise of new technologies.” (Location 221)\nNo matter where we live, we might find ourselves cocooned by a web of unfathomable algorithms that manage our lives, reshape our politics and culture, and even reengineer our bodies and minds—while we can no longer comprehend the forces that control us, let alone stop them. (Location 243)\nAI is the first technology in history that can make decisions and create new ideas by itself. All previous human inventions have empowered humans, because no matter how powerful the new tool was, the decisions about its usage remained in our hands. Knives and bombs do not themselves decide whom to kill. They are dumb tools, lacking the intelligence necessary to process information and make independent decisions. In contrast, AI can process information by itself, and thereby replace humans in decision making. AI isn’t a tool—it’s an agent. (Location 249)\nHomo Deus hypothesized that if humans aren’t careful, we might dissolve within the torrent of information like a clump of earth within a gushing river, and that in the grand scheme of things humanity will turn out to have been just a ripple within the cosmic dataflow.

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open, fight.” This binary interpretation of history implies that every human interaction is a power struggle between oppressors and oppressed. (Location 300)\nTraditional religions like Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism have typically characterized humans as untrustworthy power-hungry creatures who can access the truth only thanks to the intervention of a divine intelligence.

(Location 418)\nWhen is a pigeon just a pigeon, and when is it information? (Location 470)\nThe naive view of information argues that objects are defined as information in the context of truth seeking. Something is information if people use it to try to discover the truth. This view links the concept of information with the concept of truth and assumes that the main role of information is to represent reality. (Location 472)\nWhile different people, nations, or cultures may have competing beliefs and feelings, they cannot possess contradictory truths, because they all share a universal reality. Anyone who rejects universalism rejects truth. (Location 488)\nTruth and reality are nevertheless different things, because no matter how truthful an account is, it can never represent reality in all its aspects. (Location 490)\nThe point is that even the most truthful accounts of reality can never represent it in full. There are always some aspects of reality that are neglected or distorted in every representation. Truth, then, isn’t a one-to-one representation of reality. Rather, truth is something that brings our attention to certain aspects of reality while inevitably ignoring other aspects. No account of reality is 100 percent accurate, but some accounts are nevertheless more truthful than others. (Location 531)\nThis idea, sometimes called the counterspeech doctrine, is associated with the U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis D. Brandeis, who wrote in Whitney v. California (1927) that the remedy to false speech is more speech and that in the long term free discussion is bound to expose falsehoods and fallacies. If all information is an attempt to represent reality, then as the amount of information in the world grows, we can expect the flood of information to expose the occasional lies and errors and to ultimately provide us with a more truthful understanding of the world. On this crucial point, this book strongly disagrees with the naive view. (Location 539)\nIf only people were given more information about the universe, surely they would abandon astrology altogether. (Location 548)\nDNA and adrenaline thereby help to connect trillions of cells in the heart, legs, and other body parts to form a functioning network that can do remarkable things, (Location 580)\nInformation is something that creates new realities by connecting different points into a network. This still includes the view of information as representation. (Location 592)\n\nNew highlights added October 9, 2024 at 9:39 AM\n\nTo conclude, information sometimes represents reality, and sometimes doesn’t. But it always connects. This is its fundamental characteristic. Therefore, when examining the role of information in history, although it sometimes makes sense to ask “How well does it represent reality? Is it true or false?” often the more crucial questions are “How well does it connect people? What new network does it create?” (Location 635)\nWhile information always connects, some types of information—from scientific books to political speeches—may strive to connect people by accurately representing certain aspects of reality. But this requires a special effort, which most information does not make. This is why the naive view is wrong to believe that creating more powerful information technology will necessarily result in a more truthful understanding of the world. If no additional steps are taken to tilt the balance in favor of truth, an increase in the amount and speed of information is likely to swamp the relatively rare and expensive truthful accounts by much more common and cheap types of information. (Location 639)\nContrary to what the naive view believes, Homo sapiens didn’t conquer the world because we are talented at turning information into an accurate map of reality. Rather, the secret of our success is that we are talented at using information to connect lots of individuals. Unfortunately, this ability often goes hand in hand with believing in lies, errors, and fantasies. (Location 646)\nWe Sapiens rule the world not because we are so wise but because we are the only animals that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. (Location 658)\nThe Catholic Church has about 1.4 billion members. China has a population of about 1.4 billion. The global trade network connects about 8 billion Sapiens. (Location 663)\nmore than a few hundred individuals.[1] It takes many years and common experiences to get to know someone’s unique character and history and to cultivate ties of mutual trust and affection. Consequently, if Sapiens networks were connected only by personal human-to-human bonds, our networks would have remained very small. (Location 665)\nA story can thereby serve like a central connector, with an unlimited number of outlets into which an unlimited number of people can plug. (Location 679)\nPeople think they connect to the person, but in fact they connect to the story told about the person, and there is often a huge gulf between the two. (Location 703)\nWhile branding campaigns are occasionally a cynical exercise of disinformation, most of the really big stories of history have been the result of emotional projections and wishful thinking.

The two levels of reality that preceded storytelling are objective reality and subjective reality. (Location 765)\nThe information humans exchange about intersubjective things doesn’t represent anything that had already existed prior to the exchange of information; rather, the exchange of information creates these things. (Location 773)\nOf all genres of stories, those that create intersubjective realities have been the most crucial for the development of large-scale human networks. (Location 812)\nThis Marxist view, however, is not only cynical but wrong. While materialist interests certainly played a role in the Crusades, World War I, the Iraq War, and most other human conflicts, that does not mean that religious, national, and liberal ideals played no role at all. (Location 850)\nHistory is often shaped not by deterministic power relations, but rather by tragic mistakes that result from believing in mesmerizing but harmful stories. (Location 878)\nWhen it comes to uniting people, fiction enjoys two inherent advantages over the truth. First, fiction can be made as simple (Location 911)\nas we like, whereas the truth tends to be complicated, because the reality it is supposed to represent is complicated. (Location 912)\nTelling a fictional story is lying only when you pretend that the story is a true representation of reality. Telling a fictional story isn’t lying when you avoid such pretense and acknowledge that you are trying to create a new intersubjective reality rather than represent a preexisting objective reality. (Location 930)\nThe genius of the U.S. Constitution is that by acknowledging that it is a legal fiction created by human beings, it was able to provide mechanisms to reach agreement on amending itself and remedying its own injustices (Location 944)\nunlike the U.S. Constitution, the Ten Commandments failed to provide any amendment mechanism. There is no Eleventh Commandment that says, “You can amend commandments by a two-thirds majority vote.” (Location 951)\nHaving a lot of information doesn’t in and of itself guarantee either truth or order. It is a difficult process to use information to discover the truth and simultaneously use it to maintain order. What makes things worse is that these two processes are often contradictory, because it is frequently easier to maintain order through fictions. (Location 975)\nThat’s a major reason why the history of human information networks isn’t a triumphant march of progress. While over the generations human networks have grown increasingly powerful, they have not necessarily grown increasingly wise. If a network privileges order over truth, it can become very powerful but use that power unwisely. (Location 994)\nInstead of a march of progress, the history of human information networks is a tightrope walk trying to balance truth with order.

(Location 1986)\nWitch hunts were a catastrophe caused by the spread of toxic information. They are a prime example of a problem that was created by information, and was made worse by more information. (Location 2032)\nThe history of the early modern European witch craze demonstrates that releasing barriers to the flow of information doesn’t necessarily lead to the discovery and spread of truth.

Printers and booksellers made a lot more money from the lurid tales of The Hammer of the Witches than they did from the dull mathematics of Copernicus’s On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres. (Location 2042)\nThe history of print and witch-hunting indicates that an unregulated information market doesn’t necessarily lead people to identify and correct their errors, because it may well prioritize outrage over truth. For truth to win, it is necessary to establish curation institutions that have the power to tilt the balance in favor of the facts.

A significant amount of applied research has focused on building security controls. (Location 1199)\nAll security controls must reflect a policy. A control without a policy is meaningless and policy without a control is useless. (Location 1202)\ncyber space is constantly in flux as new technologies, hardware, and software are developed. (Location 1412)\nCyber security science is not for answering the question of “what are the physics of cyber space,” but instead “what physics of cyber space would be necessary to achieve the behavior/response we want and how do we create that cyber space.” (Location 1419)\nThe metaphysical nature of cyber space is also different than physical space as we still lack the mathematical constructs to define it. Geometry is a math of defining physical space where blocks of matter and mass can be mathematically described. We lack this ability to define cyber space. Length, distance, and other measures have no bearing in cyber space. In addition, concepts such as force in physical space also has no known corollary in cyber space. What all of this means is that there has not been any discovered first principles of cyber space.

(Location 1642)\nScience is a journey of discovery and knowledge acquisition. Science seeks to answer questions and explain the riddles of the universe, as compared to engineering that seeks to design and develop solutions to address specific problems. In practice, the line between science and engineering is often quite blurred, as questions are answered in pursuit of solutions and engineering is required to even pose the questions needed. (Location 1658)\nThe scientific process starts with a question. This question could be general or quite specific; it could be inspired by previous work, or events that are seemingly innocuous from your life outside of work. (Location 1666)\nAlbert Einstein has been historically attributed as saying, “If we knew what we were doing it wouldn’t be called research, would it?” (Location 1670)\nObservational research is useful when you are trying to understand a real cyber system (and the associated technosocial behavior). This type of research is best to answer open-ended or comparatively broad research questions. In general, observational research methods include sensing of real-world environments and data mining for discovery of interesting artifacts. (Location 1749)\nas Dr. Talib describes in his book, Black Swan,19 rare events are often retroactively explained, and the public, or indeed a researcher’s ability to predict the likelihood of a rare cyber event is fraught with assumptions or failures.

(Location 4205)\nin science, a theory represents a foundational piece of knowledge around which research and even fields of research are built. (Location 4206)\nIt starts as a belief based on observations. This belief is a cognitive model that can be formulated with language. (Location 4208)\nA formal definition of a theory is a mathematical representation of the behavior of a system. A theory that has significant empirical support and is widely accepted becomes a law. (Location 4209)\nA lemma is an intermediate step or component of a larger theory. (Location 4223)\nGood theory should be coherent, parsimonious, and systematic explanation or view of phenomena, events, situations, and behaviors. Beyond that, it must be predicative.

The security industry was not fixing things because the fundamental problems ran deeper than software: it was about business models, corporate power, and legal limitations. And the government was oblivious, slow-moving, or bought off, especially outside of the military. (Location 1345)\nBecause every program of any size has critical flaws that can be leveraged by an attacker, greater complexity aided hackers and handicapped defenders. But the software suppliers lacked the incentives that drove ordinary manufacturers to make safer products. The software companies had convinced the courts that product-liability laws did not apply to them. Technically, they licensed their products instead of selling them, and they forced users to waive the right to sue at the moment of installation.

It instructs the newly divided cells on what type of cells they should be and what they should remain, sometimes for decades, as in the case of individual brain neurons and certain immune cells. (Location 548)\nTogether, these genes form a surveillance network within our bodies, communicating with one another between cells and between organs by releasing proteins and chemicals into the bloodstream, monitoring and responding to what we eat, how much we exercise, and what time of day it is. They tell us to hunker down when the going gets tough, and they tell us to grow fast and reproduce fast when the going gets easier. (Location 579)\nThe longevity genes I work on are called “sirtuins,” named after the yeast SIR2 gene, the first one to be discovered. There are seven sirtuins in mammals, SIRT1 to SIRT7, and they are made by almost every cell in the body. (Location 585)\nThey have also evolved to require a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD. As we will see later, the loss of NAD as we age, and the resulting decline in sirtuin activity, is thought to be a primary reason our bodies develop diseases when we are old but not when we are young. (Location 591)\nLike that of sirtuins, mTOR activity is exquisitely regulated by nutrients. And like the sirtuins, mTOR can signal cells in stress to hunker down and improve survival by boosting such activities as DNA repair, reducing inflammation caused by senescent cells, (Location 606)\nThe other pathway is a metabolic control enzyme known as AMPK, which evolved to respond to low energy levels. It has also been highly conserved among species and, as with sirtuins and TOR, we have learned a lot about how to control it. (Location 614)\nHere’s the important point: there are plenty of stressors that will activate longevity genes without damaging the cell, including certain types of exercise, intermittent fasting, low-protein diets, and exposure to hot and cold temperatures (I discuss this in chapter 4). That’s called hormesis. (Location 619)\nThe pianist that makes this happen is the epigenome. Through a process of revealing our DNA or bundling it up in tight protein packages, and by marking genes with chemical tags called methyls and acetyls composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, the epigenome uses our genome to make the music of our lives.

(Location 890)\nWe tend to think of aging as something that begins happening to us at midlife, because that’s when we start to see significant changes to our bodies. But Horvath’s clock begins ticking the moment we are born. (Location 1006)\nof the symptoms of aging—the conditions that push mice, like humans, farther toward the precipice of death—were being caused not by mutation but by the epigenetic changes that come as a result of DNA damage signals.

Yeah, thanks for having me. I think it’s a great question, and I think it kind of starts with what’s the value that folks get out of a sim today, right? Originally, this value started compliance reporting, right? Put a bunch of your logs in here, and we’ll get you that checklist of whether you’re meeting certain compliance regulations, right? Then I think this kind of evolved into security practitioners jumping into the tools and getting value out of sims for forensics, right? Okay, I know I had a security incident. Maybe my antivirus told me something, you know, look bad, and I want to go and do a more thorough investigation. And then I think on that maturity curve, there was kind of the next advancement around actually using SIMs for detection. And I think this is really where SIMs are still today, right, and trying to prove out value around detection. And I think if you look at what you need in order to provide value from detection in a sim that’s not in a control point, right? And being able to kind of aggregate this global view across all your different control surfaces, whether they be endpoint, network identity, etc, is around how can we bring data together? How can we have that, you know, in a common format, have that in something that detection rules can run over and have that be something that can be queried and metrics can be driven out Of to be joined against threat intel and kind of all these use cases. And so I think that really comes back to if that’s kind of the next value prop for SIEM, right? And some organizations achieve that to an extent today and a lot don’t, right? Then I think it comes to this question of, okay, where does that data need to live? And how does it need to be operationalized to achieve that goal? And I think that brings this into kind of an interesting set of questions where today, I think a lot of those use cases require all that data to be in one place. That data today lives in many different places, which is why I think this topic has become very popular. And I think there’s this open question on, hey, in the future, is this kind of going to be a lot of data still needs to be centralized? Can some of it run more at the edge of where your data lives? I think those are kind of the key elements.\nTim Peacock\nSo help me understand, you’re proposing a world where you can achieve centralized visibility without centralized data? I think that’s the goal of this kind of disaggregation or shimming on top of other data lakes approach.\nTravis Lanham\nI don’t think that it’s very effective today. I think a lot of the why folks are trying out this approach is because the number of control points that they have generating logs or generating telemetry or visibility into their environments Has grown a lot. And their security teams or a operational management teams haven’t been able to scale out their kind of centralized visibility as quickly, right? And so often kind of falling back to that second value add, right, around forensics, right? Often, you know, what we’ll see folks trying to do is, hey, I need to go and do forensics in this cloud environment and the logs for that cloud environment live there. And that might turn into, okay, I need to run some queries against that data, or I need to pull that data into my SIM and then run some queries there. But I think it’s still kind of stuck in that forensics security, right? It’s still not getting into that true vision for SIM as being this kind of central detection point where you can really get a lot of metrics that will help you do kind of more threat intel Driven approach to detection that will help you ultimately become what I think that first compliance milestone was around. You have the forensics, but then with the detection, you could also potentially get into this, you know, a future state of the sim as being this kind of governance control point, right, Where you can not only have compliance as a reporting capability, but you could have kind of this thing that sim is naturally positioned well for because it has all this visibility, Which is to actually have, hey, here are the compliance controls that I want to enforce across my environment. I have all the monitoring visibility that telling me, am I meeting those or not? And then I can hook into kind of the remediation side or the prevention side and actuate out in my environment. Here are the controls that need to be enabled, you know, two-factor authentication, you know, binary denial listing, whatever it might be, right? And kind of have that, you know, be that value add of having that central view of the data. And so I think it’s like today, a lot of that requires having all that data in one place. And I don’t think that, you know, there’s really been an effective way to get that central point of visibility without being able to put your data all together. (Time 0:02:41)\n\n\nCentralization Challenges\n\nCentralized data platforms struggle to keep pace with expanding attack surfaces.\nForensic investigations in cloud environments often necessitate pulling data into SIEMs, hindering real-time detection.\nTranscript:\nAnton Chuvakin\nWait a second. That to me doesn’t automatically mean we have to decouple. I mean, in theory, you can build a platform that combines high-scale storage. Oh, no, I guess I’ll cut off myself in the middle of the question because if you’re doing it federated, you probably can’t really truly couple it, right? So that’s the argument?\nTravis Lanham\nI think there’s one kind of piece that’s around things like performance and like, can you really do a lot of these powerful metrics across all your different visibility points, etc. Right? I think there’s another piece of this, which is really around whether if you have different data sources in your sim today, and you know, a lot of people have kind of tried different approaches To normalization, like, is that normalized format able to give you something that I can ask a question, and it goes across all my log sources and gives me the answer, right? Even a simple question like, have I seen IP address x in my environment, right, that requires doing that kind of basic level of normalization, that if you have a sim today, and you have Multiple data sources in your sim today, a lot of folks aren’t even getting to that kind of maturity level of, okay, I have even these most basic parts of those security logs parsed into A consistent manner, right? So I think that’s almost, if we’re not doing really well at that problem today, in the industry, then trying to do that across a federated approach, where all the data isn’t even in the Same system, I think becomes this exponentially more difficult problem. (Time 0:07:12)\n\n\nDecoupled SIEM Considerations\n\nConsider the upsides of decoupled SIEMs, such as leveraging existing storage solutions and focusing on security.\nAcknowledge potential drawbacks like assembly complexity and performance issues.\nTranscript:\nAnton Chuvakin\nSo wait a second. So people who insist on decoupling or sort of disconnecting the security part from the data storage part, like, what are the upsides? Like, do you have compassion to these people? Or do you think they’re wrong? Or like, how do you think about not trying to lead you to an answer? I’m just like, just curious, because I see those industry debates when people say, no, no, no, no, no. Now we have this amazing storage. We can just build security, plug it in into the scalable storage, whether it’s BQ or something else, and we’ll have a SIM better than anything that came before, even though it’s technically Decoupled. And these are tempting, but I also have this flashbacks to the time of the old times when, sure, you can buy an Oracle database off the shelf and then build on top of that. And then you would have a decoupled sim, but that approach we abandoned. So I’m schizophrenic about this, torn, really torn about this. (Time 0:08:33)\n\n\nGoogle’s SecOps Approach\n\nGoogle’s SecOps prioritizes centralized visibility for proactive threat detection and response after the Aurora attack.\nThis approach facilitates innovation and threat intelligence integration for a comprehensive security posture.\nTranscript:\nTim Peacock\nBut like thinking about it, and you’ve been at Chronicle a while, or sorry, SecOps. Well, you were at Chronicle for a long time and you’ve been at SecOps for a little while. Tell us about why we haven’t gone this direction as Google Cloud. Like why do we persist in this central and consistent so that you can do easy, like, I want to find this IP, that’s a single line query? Why haven’t we gone this other direction?\nTravis Lanham\nYeah, I think for us, kind of the motivation starts around where Google has come from solving this problem, right? And where we’ve come from solving this problem, you know, even in response to Google’s own Aurora attack a decade ago, right, was we really need to get centralized visibility into all These different surfaces that we have. And once we have that centralized visibility, now we’ll be able to not only achieve kind of that basic compliance capability, not only that forensics capability, but actually be able To go and innovate in that detection capability or that higher order capability. And so where we’ve come in delivering the product out to customers is trying to get them to that same point, right? And this comes out in a lot of different ways in the product, where we do things like thread until matching and retroactive IOC matching, where we have your detection content that goes And runs over log for your data. In order to do that, we really need this data to be in one place, we need it to be in a consistent format. And so that’s been a big area of focus for us initially. I think kind of looking to the future, right, I think there are kind of all these areas of expansion that we can go into, right? And we’ve already done some of this with SOAR, for example, today, where in SOAR, you can kind of do this federated forensics use case and tie that back into SIEM very closely and get the Threat Intel view on that data. And so I think there’s kind of been like the first steps toward it. But I think it still comes back to this. The hard part is around having consistency in your data, right? Having a consistent view of the data where you can now do analytics, right? And then with that baseline of analytics, you get detections, you get threat intel kind of being proactive view. And then ultimately, I think you’ll be able to get into this compliance plus plus of the governance, right? And be able to get into this, okay, we have this great view of visibility. And now we can actually start actuating the policy that we want to enforce in our environment. (Time 0:11:56)\n\n\nCoupled SIEM Advantages\n\nTightly coupled SIEMs offer integrated data consistency and best-in-class capabilities for security data operations.\nFeatures like real-time search, detection, and aliasing enhance threat investigation and noise reduction.\nTranscript:\nAnton Chuvakin\nCan also be decoupled and still do exactly that right in theory you can have the off-the commercial data store and then assume that it’s there at the client site and then just build the Security layer so presumably when we decided to not do that we saw other upsides of a tightly coupled data store plus sim plus security experience so maybe you can talk about these like What are the what are reasons but consistency? Because you can achieve consistency with VQ or whatever, as a data storage backend, we didn’t do it, though.\nTravis Lanham\nDefinitely. So I think there’s kind of that baseline, right, of like, why kind of start with this approach, right? And it gets a lot of those pieces, like, okay, we have central consistency over the content, we have central consistency over, you know, the parsing and detection rules and the metrics That are generating kind of all those pieces that are core building blocks of the platform. And so I think that’s, hey, the easy way to get that right, or the way to get that in a more comprehensive fashion is where you can have end to end testing over all that content, you can have This kind of very cohesive story where it’s all integrated well together, right? So that’s kind of the starting point, right? And then on top of that foundation, right, we’ve really built out a series of best-in capabilities for operating over your security data that just wouldn’t be available in an off-the Database or, you know, a Parquet file set that, you know, folks are putting their Databricks instance on top of or, you know, putting in some data into Snowflake, right? And so a lot of those capabilities we’ve driven around are how can we bring Google search to your security data, right? How can we kind of get out of this method of having tons of indices or these folders of data and provide this kind of, hey, I just want to look at this alert. I want to put in an entity in my search. I want to see everything that we have around that, the threat intel overlay on top of that. I just want this kind of unified investigation experience and make that as easy as going and doing a Google search, right? And in order to do that, building on kind of Google’s great foundational infrastructure, we’ve built a bunch of application platform infrastructure on top of that in order to support Things like real-time search, (Time 0:14:07)\n\n\nNoise Reduction with SecOps\n\nCustomers using SecOps achieved significant noise reduction in alerts, like unauthorized service account key downloads.\nThis was possible by simplifying complex lookups and unifying data, freeing security engineers for proactive threat analysis.\nTranscript:\nTravis Lanham\nAnd so we’ve had customers, for example, that have been able to achieve dramatic noise reduction in their alerts because I’ll use an example where it’s, hey, I wanted to alert on any Time someone downloads a service account key for my cloud environment, right, that’s not part of the SRE or IT team. And before for them, that was kind of this complicated mix of what Anton was talking about, right? Maybe I have some lookup tables. Maybe I have some things that happen in SOAR, right, as kind of these enrichment playbooks. And it’s hard to keep all of this consistent. It’s hard to have this kind of, now you’re responsible as a security team, not only for doing this, okay, I need to load that data into this place. I need to keep that data consistent for, here are all the people in my organization, here’s their job role, et cetera, right? But now I also need to keep that consistent with my detection logic. And so now you’ve turned the security engineer’s job into, hey, your job isn’t to investigate threats and look out proactively for the risk of the organization. But your job is to be this human extracts, transform load pipeline of your CMDB data into your security system and then try and maintain consistency with all these playbooks. And kind of it just becomes this complicated mess rather than doing in kind of this. Hey, you just bring your data in. All of this gets enriched together, and we present this unified picture, right? And I think that kind of, again, connecting it to the beginning, right, is a lot of these kind of capabilities, Google search over security data, always on enrichment, you know, detection At really unlimited scale, these really wouldn’t be possible unless you have a platform that’s built for security, rather than just taking some Parquet files that are in some cloud Object storage. (Time 0:20:02)\n\n\nDecoupled SIEM Limitations\n\nDecoupled SIEMs often focus on interface and content, lacking innovative processing capabilities.\nThis limits advanced functionalities like efficient search, noise reduction, and prioritization for improved security maturity.\nTranscript:\nAnton Chuvakin\nCorrect. I think that it has to do with one of the lessons from Google, sort of like how innovative products ultimately require or the best innovative products require technical innovation. So they need to be an invention under the hood. It can’t be the, oh, we’ll just speed it up a little bit or we’ll just do this. So in your mind, if you’re thinking about sims that are trying to decouple from data stores, what may be the technical innovation driving them? Like, I’m a little puzzled here.\nTravis Lanham\nI think that that’s kind of one of the fundamental issues, right? That if you’re trying to be this shim layer, right? Ultimately, a lot of the value that you’re providing is kind of interface at the interface level, right? Or it’s ultimately a kind of the content level, right? And trying to stitch together this kind of different set of data silos, rather than providing a really innovative processing capability on top of it, right? And so it’s fine as kind of this, hey, I want to be able to see all these different parts of my environment, right? Or I want to be able to extend into these places where I don’t have stuff set up, right? And I wasn’t bringing my logs into, you know, the place that I want to, right? But it’s not really getting to that. How do I have amazing search over my data? How do I have all these capabilities that allow me to, you know, have better noise reduction, have better prioritization, kind of all these more capabilities up the maturity curve. And I think this is also why folks who have kind of gone down this road, right? Of, okay, yeah, I’ll just keep my logs in cloud object storage. And I don’t need to really worry about bringing them into a SIEM. It’s like ultimately when they find themselves in an incident, they find themselves, okay, now I need to pull these (Time 0:21:51)\n\n\nData Management in SIEM\n\nCentralized SIEM simplifies data management for security teams, avoiding data infrastructure tasks during incidents.\nDecentralized approaches can burden security teams with data handling during critical times, hindering effective response.\nTranscript:\nAnton Chuvakin\nSo that’s not fun at all. What about the argument that allows the security people to deal with security and leave the data storage to quote-unquote data people? Like the argument that if I have a team of 20, I can dedicate 20 to security and have the storage to be magically done by somebody else who I pay or who my clients pay.\nTravis Lanham\nWhy does this argument not hold water? I think this is the argument for not going in the kind of decentralized version of this, right? Or not going in the disaggregated version, right? Because if you have that kind of centralized point and you have someone who’s responsible for the storage, right? Then your security team doesn’t need to be worrying about that, right? If you have this kind of, okay, I have all these different data silos, right? And then you have the incident come through. Now your security team is often playing that data infrastructure role, right? Or again, kind of at the worst possible time, you’re throwing in a whole nother part of the IT organization to try and help the security team, right? And now you have not only the security incident itself and the coordination that the security team needs to be doing with all the folks, you know, they’re either impacted by the incident Or, you know, that are the trigger of the incident or whatever, right? Or the exposure of the incident, right? But now they have to be coordinating with this team that’s actually just trying to like get all the visibility into one place. I have been trying since Anton asked that to think of a suitable (Time 0:23:42)\n\n\nSIEM Maturity Assessment\n\nAssess your organization’s SIEM maturity level to determine the best approach.\nFocus on evolving from basic compliance to advanced risk management and proactive threat hunting.\nTranscript:\nTim Peacock\nMetaphor and I have failed, which maybe means sadly, it’s time for the end of the episode. I have to ask our traditional closing questions, Travis. One, do you have a tip to help people think about the future of Sim and which way they should go as an org? And two, do you have recommended reading? Because we hate to leave listeners empty handed.\nTravis Lanham\nYeah, so I think the first one is really kind of thinking about that maturity curve, right? And where are you on it, right? Are you doing kind of checkbox compliance? Are you doing kind of more around the forensics? Or are you starting to build out detection capabilities? Are you starting to build out you know, and I think this is even more for lean kind of some of those governance controls, and really taking a risk lens on top of your security data, right? Because ultimately, this is where organizations are orienting towards now, right? Where it’s, hey, I’ve gotten all this IT infrastructure, security is top of mind. And I really need to be thinking about how do I prioritize and manage the risk of my attack surface, right? And so I think that’s, you know, where we see a lot of folks putting a lot of energy around today. And then for required reading, I think there are a bunch of different sources. Suggested reading. Yeah, yeah. Instead of frequently, recommended, frequent demands, kind of that logic. Yeah, recommended reading. I mean, I think there are lots of great blogs out there. The things that I find actually most interesting usually are just when folks post an instant report, right? You’ll have Cloudflare, you’ll have Snowflake or whoever, right? Posting an instant report or getting a threat report, whether it be from Google Threat Intel or some other source, right? I think those are usually kind of always interesting, right? Because you really kind of start to get into the heart, especially for the ones that are quite well written, or Oak does another example, right? Where organizations who have done a service to the broader community by really writing up, hey, here was our experience. Here’s things that you should be looking for, right?\nTim Peacock\nAnd here’s kind of a view on how this happened to us and how you can think about preventing it for yourselves. I think that’s such a great way of looking at an after action report of here’s how you can avoid having this happen to you. But (Time 0:25:00)\n\n\nSecurity Data Lakes\n\nSecurity data lakes are envisioned for next-gen SIEM scalability and custom analytics, especially in mature organizations.\nCentralizing data in a data lake architecture enables scalable performance and advanced analytics capabilities.\nTranscript:\nAnton Chuvakin\nBefore we go, before we finish, we managed to run this whole episode without once mentioning the security data lake. I just am curious how they connect to this whole thing, because you see people enamored with the concept, but you don’t always see people who understand what they’re talking about, Right?\nTim Peacock\nI see. Okay, Travis, what’s the security data like? And why are people enamored?\nTravis Lanham\nYeah, I think at least when I’ve heard folks discuss it, it’s mainly been a couple of contexts, right? One context is around this idea of next generation SIEM, right? Or SIEM built for scale, right? And being able to put all of your data into a SIEM and have this data lake architecture that can really scale up beyond some of the approaches that have been tried earlier in the industry That you kind of mentioned, whether it’s taking off the shelf single node database or taking a single rack server, right? To really get into this data lake of, okay, it’s horizontally scalable and you can kind of decouple the compute and storage, right, and really get your great performance, etc. That way. I think the other way or place that it comes up is basically in this folks wanting to do their own security analytics, right, or folks wanting to have their own, you know, Hadoop infrastructure And do security analytics themselves, I think, particularly for some of the really mature tech or kind of government organizations, right? And I think in there, you know, that kind of is, you know, I think it’s very related in order to do that. And if you want to have your own analytics jobs and things like that, you probably want to have your data in one place. And so I think that kind of ties into a lot of the things that (Time 0:27:00)\n\n\n"},"Readwise/Podcasts/Parrish---Morgan-Housel-Get-Rich,-Stay-Rich":{"slug":"Readwise/Podcasts/Parrish---Morgan-Housel-Get-Rich,-Stay-Rich","filePath":"Readwise/Podcasts/Parrish - Morgan Housel Get Rich, Stay Rich.md","title":"Parrish - Morgan Housel Get Rich, Stay Rich","links":["The-Knowledge-Project-with-Shane-Parrish","tags/podcasts","starred"],"tags":["podcasts"],"content":"Morgan Housel: Get Rich, Stay Rich\nMetadata\n\nAuthor: The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish\nFull Title: Morgan Housel: Get Rich, Stay Rich\nCategory: podcasts\nURL: share.snipd.com/episode/5b454dc5-0f98-4726-810f-cbf1ef827d6f\n\nHighlights\n\nFOMO\n\nAvoid FOMO (fear of missing out) to build wealth.\nResist the urge to chase short-term gains.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nHaving FOMO is the single most important financial skill. I think it’s so important that you cannot ever imagine accumulating significant wealth over your lifetime if you are susceptible to FOMO. Like if there’s literally one thing, one trait that you want that’s going to allow you to accumulate wealth, it’s the lack of FOMO. Particularly in modern markets, I can get so crazy with social media and Reddit and Twitter and everything. If you are susceptible to FOMO, there’s no hope for you over time. I really don’t think that’s an exaggeration. And that being able to see your neighbor get much richer than you and not being impacted by it is so incredibly critical and easy to overlook these days. (Time 0:12:46)\n\n\nIndex Funds\n\nInvest in index funds for the long term.\nAim for average returns over an extended period.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nAnd I think that’s a great way to frame it. I don’t get jealous or anxious to watch other people get richer than I am over time. My investing strategy is to own index funds for as long as I possibly can, to be average for an above average period of time. And I think that will actually lead to an incredible outcome. Not only will it achieve the financial goals that I have for my family, but I think over a long period of time it will put you in the top decile at least of people who are, who are compounding Money over time. (Time 0:13:54)\n\n\nInvesting Paradox\n\nInvesting is counterintuitive: less effort often yields better results.\nThe harder you try, the worse you’re likely to perform, unlike other life endeavors.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nThink we find it boring and that’s why we don’t want to do it?\nSpeaker 1\nIt’s a combination of boredom and just the counter intuition of the less effort the better we’re going to do. Because any other endeavor in life, whether it’s your physical fitness or whatever it might be, there’s a positive correlation. If you want to become in better shape, you exercise, you put more effort into it. In most endeavors in life, the harder you try, the better you’re going to do. And investing is just not one of those. And it’s so not intuitive that people end up tripping over themselves. (Time 0:20:02)\n\n\nMortgage Payoff\n\nMorgan Housel paid off his low-interest mortgage, calling it his worst financial but best money decision.\nPrioritizing happiness over spreadsheet optimization improved his family’s quality of life.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nFinancially and what’s optimal psychologically. We’ve had this conversation before where you told me you paid off your mortgage.\nSpeaker 1\nAnd that makes no very little financial sense because you had one of those crazy, like really low mortgages. Like I’m worried it was 3.2% fixed for 30 years and we paid it off, which I say is very true is the worst financial decision we’ve ever made. But it’s the best money decision we’ve ever made. And the difference between the two is like, look on a spreadsheet, it’s terrible. I’ve done the math of like, what if I had just invested that money instead? How much more money would we have today? It’s a lot. It’s a lot of money. But nothing that we’ve ever done in our financial life has given us more happiness than paying that off. And a lot of that is unique maybe to my personality. This is not advice for other people because maybe you and other people don’t have that personality. I’m a worst case scenario thinker. I also have a career that can be thickle. And so, and I’m the sole breadwinner in our household. My wife is home with our kids. So with all of those, my personality, my career and whatnot, it made perfect sense. And when we did it, I was nearly in tears with joy when we did it. Knowing full well that it was a dumb financial decision. So I think once you stop viewing money as just trying to make the spreadsheet happy and you view it as a tool to live a better life. A lot of things change. And in that situation, it was a tool that improved the quality of my life and my family’s life, I think dramatically. Even if it was the dumbest thing that we’ve ever done on a spreadsheet. (Time 0:25:21)\n\n\nMoney’s True Value\n\nMoney buys independence and time with loved ones, not just material possessions.\nUse money as a tool for happiness, not as a status symbol.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nWhat can money do for us and what can it do for us?\nSpeaker 2\nWhat’s the lie it tells us? What’s the thing that we feel like it can do for us that it can’t?\nSpeaker 1\nWell, I think the, the lie is that a lot of people in life, if they’re unsatisfied with how their life is going, it’s a very quick and easy answer to say if I had more money, things would be Better. And that can be true. It can solve a lot of your problems. But I think what a lot of people want in life, not everyone, I don’t want to completely generalize this, but what I want that I think is, is reasonably common for people is I want independence. And I want to spend time with the people who I love, my family and friends. And that’s pretty much it. And can you use money to do that? Of course, money is, is kind of the oxygen of independence. And if you can use your money to spend more time with your friends and family, you and I went out to a lovely dinner last night with each other. That costs money. Thank you for buying by the way. And we had a great time with each other. Now, if you and I went for a walk that would have been free, it would have been great too. But using money to spend time with whom you want, when you want, for as long as you want, waking up every morning and saying, I can do whatever I want today. Even if what I want to do is go to work and be productive, is absolutely critical. And that is different from the knee jerk of just, oh, if I have more money, I can buy more things, nicer things. But what you actually want in your soul is to like, is you want independence and to spend time with people who we love. Money can do those things, but it’s not as direct as people, as people think. One example of this is like, will having a nicer house make you happier? It might, but the reason it’s going to make you happier is because it makes it easier to have friends over. It’s, it’s, it makes it more convenient to hang out with your kids in a big, nice, glorious living room. So it’s not that the house will make you happier, but the house can make it more conducive to do things in your life that those things will make you happier. (Time 0:27:57)\n\nTags: starred\n\n\n\n\nEarly Retirement\n\nMorgan Housel’s parents were frugal, enabling his dad to retire early from a stressful ER doctor career.\nSaving for independence is more valuable than overspending.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nThere’s so many things that we inherit from our parents, like invisible rules about money or practices around money. I remember like these moments in my childhood where, you know, my parents had to decide between fixing the roof and fixing the car and they couldn’t afford to do both. And I remember they, you know, they worked for the military and the military had sent them a financial advisor. And I remember listening to the conversation they had with the financial advisor and how out of the loop, they were with what was happening with my, you know, the severance pay that my Mom was getting and what was happening. And they had new knowledge of it. And I was like, I never want to be in this position. What are the lessons that you learned from your parents that really stick with you today that sort of defined how you think about money?\nSpeaker 1\nThe two things that stick out for my parents, my parents upbringing. So my dad started undergraduate college when he was 30 and had three kids. I’m the youngest of three. He started his undergrad when I was like a month old, something like that. And he became a doctor when I was in third grade. My early childhood, my parents were very, very poor. I was a doctor for students and maybe they had some like student grants that allowed us to buy groceries and live in a tiny little apartment. We were very happy at a great childhood, but they were very, very poor. And then my dad became a doctor when I was in third grade and had the, so it was a immediate shift towards very poor to like upper middle class, literally overnight when I was in third grade. And then my brother and sister were teenagers at that point. So I got to see very like both sides of the spectrum. And I remember the year 1993 is the year everything changed in our family. What sticks out from that is that the frugality that was demanded of my parents when they were poor stuck with them after they started making more money. And so even after my dad became a doctor, they were, we were very frugal. We lived a much better life than we did when we were poor because we were, we were living in abject poverty for most of my childhood. But after that, it was, they had a very high savings rate. We were not spending money like my dad’s coworkers were. Like you would expect a normal doctor too, it was nothing close to that. I think I looked down upon my parents for that. I was like, we could be living in an nicer house. I know how much money you make. We could be living in a better house and driving a better car, but we don’t because you’re cheap skates. That was my view for my teens and early twenties. My dad was an ER doctor, which is a very stressful field. And so I was literally people dying in front of you in your arms every day and working night shifts and it’s a very stressful field. So after about 20 years or so, he had just had enough. And well before I think he intended to retire, he more or less woke up one day and said, I’m done. It was a little more planned than that, but that was close to it. And because he had saved so much, he could do that. He had the independence to wake up one day and say, I’m going to do like, I’m proud of what I did, but I’m going to go do something else now. And a lot of his peers could not do that because they spent like doctors. They lived in big houses and sent their kids to private school and drove fancy cars. So when they wanted to quit, they couldn’t. They wanted to retire. They were tired and they wanted to quit, but they couldn’t do it. And that was such a profound shift in my thinking. This was not that long ago. I don’t know, 12 years ago or so. Of when I was like, oh, that’s why you were saving so much. It wasn’t because you were cheap skates. It’s because you were wanting to become independent. And now you are. You want to quit so you could quit. That’s why you were saving. That was a profound shift for me. You’re not saving because you’re just scared to spend. You’re saving because you want something different, which is independence. And independence is going to give you so much more pleasure than the big house ever would. (Time 0:35:25)\n\n\nRich vs. Wealthy\n\nBeing rich means affording expenses, while being wealthy means having independence.\nWealth is hidden; don’t judge financial success by visible possessions.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nBetween being rich and being wealthy?\nSpeaker 1\nThe definitions are my own. I’m just making this up. But I think rich is when you have enough money to make your mortgage payment, make your car payment. You can pay off your credit card bill every month. Like, you can afford the things that you’re buying, technically. Wealthy, I think, is when you have a degree of independence in autonomy. The weird thing here is that wealth is the money that you don’t spend. That’s what wealth is like, the homes you didn’t buy and the car you didn’t buy. It’s money that you saved and invested that is going to give you independence. And that’s a hard thing for people to wrap their head around that wealth is what you don’t see because I can see your house. I can see your car. I can see your clothes. But I have no idea what your not worth this. I can’t see your brokerage account. I can’t see your bank account. So wealth is always hidden. And it throws a lot of people for a loop because if I was looking for a role model of physical fitness, I can see your fitness. I can see your weight and your muscle tone, whatnot. It’s all visible. But when you’re looking for a financial role model, who do you look up to? And a lot of people, particularly young people, will look up to the guy in the mansion with the Ferrari. But that guy for all you know is living paycheck to paycheck. A lot of those people are. And the person who is actually wealthy and independent might be the person in the modest house driving the modest car that you would actually want to be. If you want to be wealthy instead of just rich, you want to be independent instead of just making your monthly payments. The people that you actually want to look up to are some of the hardest people to identify in society. (Time 0:40:36)\n\n\nVanderbilt Fortune\n\nThe Vanderbilts squandered a $400 billion fortune in three generations by prioritizing excessive spending.\nAnderson Cooper, the first heir with no inheritance, became the most successful and perhaps happiest.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nSpeaking of staying rich, one of the stories we talked about last night was the Vanderbelts and how they basically blew a 400 billion fortune. What happened? If you look at all of the robber baron, very wealthy families, the Carnegie&#039;s, the JP Morgan&#039;s, the Fords, the Rockefeller&#039;s, the Vanderbelts, I think virtually all of them did well Or did a decent job at managing that dynastic money except the Vanderbelts. The Vanderbelts completely and utterly botched it. The status, you know, when Cornelius Vanderbelts died, his net worth adjusted for inflation, because he died in the 1800s, was the equivalent of 400 billion. And in three generations, there was nothing left, which is an astounding thing to think about. And in between there sat three generations who just blew money in the dumbest ways you can imagine. And the reason you could say it was dumb is because I don’t think any of them were happy. I think they were pretty much all miserable if you dig into the biographies of these three generations. A lot of the other robber baron families taught their children, taught their heirs to run the business or to become good philanthropists, whatever it was. The Vanderbelts effectively told their heirs, your job, your sole purpose on this planet is to spend more money than anyone else. And so they did it. They built the biggest houses that were so big, they didn’t even want to live in them because they were too big. They threw parties that were so extravagant, they were just burdens on themselves. They were used, like, their sole financial metric is, can you spend more money than the other socialite? And they were all miserable for it. And the story that a lot of people know now is that the first Vanderbelts heir to not get any money, when all the money was exhausted, the first heir, whether there’s nothing left, was Anderson Cooper of CNN. His mother was a woman named Gloria Vanderbelts, she got the last trust fund in the family. And Cooper is not only the most successful Vanderbelts heir in, like, 180 years, he’s probably the happiest. And he’s talked about this, that money that you are given, that you inherit, can be a burden to your ambition, a burden to your identity of building a name for yourself. And he was kind of the first Vanderbelts heir who was, like, relieved of the burden of having to carry on this thing of, like, I’m a socialite, I’m a Vanderbelts. And he’s just like, I can build my own name and my own career. (Time 0:53:41)\n\n\nReading Strategy\n\nWhen reading, use a wide funnel and tight filter: start any interesting book but quit mercilessly if it doesn’t work.\nDon’t feel obligated to finish every book.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nSwitch gears and talk about reading and writing. How do you select what you read? I heard this idea.\nSpeaker 1\nI think it was from Patrick O’Shaughnessy many years ago who said, you want a wide funnel and a tight filter. I will start reading any book on any topic that looks even mildly interesting to me. But I will slam it shut without mercy and move on to something else if it’s not working for me. A lot of the reason that people don’t read as much as they should or if they say, I’m not a big reader. A lot of the reason is because they feel morally that they need to finish every book that they start. And we realize that the majority of books, there’s 4 million books for sale on Amazon. I bet 3.9 million of those are not meant for you or for me. They’re meant for other people. But they just don’t work for what we want out of them. And if you force yourself to finish every book, your start, of course, it’s going to be a miserable experience. But when you are willing to try anything but have a filter that just has no mercy to move on if you don’t like it, that’s when you find the great books. Because if you only stick to books that you know you’re going to like about topics that you’re interested, you are missing so many other topics out there that you don’t even know that You would like. You have to try a million different things but then cut it off very quickly if you don’t like it. So that’s how I try to read. If it’s even slightly interesting, if someone has said, oh, this is a good, I will start reading it. By the way, Kindle samples are free. You have no excuse to not try any book. And then just mercilessly cut it off if it’s not working for you. (Time 1:17:07)\n\n\nWriting Advice\n\nWrite for an audience of one (yourself) and be succinct to keep readers engaged.\nGet to the point quickly and avoid unnecessary details.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nSeconds and think about how you would teach me to tell a better story. You’re one of the best storytellers of our generation. Teach me how to tell a story like Morgan Hassel.\nSpeaker 1\nI think it’s two things. One is right for an audience of one, which is yourself. Don’t think about other people. Don’t think about who’s going to read this. Don’t think. Don’t ask yourself, how is the reader going to interpret the sentence? Write a sentence that moves you. When you read it, you’re like, I like that without thinking about anyone else. I think once you start thinking about who is my audience and what are they going to like, you start to pander. And you start to perform for them in a way that is very hard to create a good emotional story about, just write for yourself. The other is, don’t forget how impatient everyone is. So this is a sense where maybe you are thinking about the reader, but everyone is so impatient when they’re reading that you just always have to ask yourself, what is the point that I’m Trying to make? Make that point and get the hell out of people’s way and move on to another point. And most storytelling, you lose it once you lose the reader. Mark Twain, he said at one point that when he would edit his reading, when he would edit his work, he would read it aloud to his family. You’d read the story aloud. And when he saw them getting bored, he would make a note, all right, cut that part. They’re clearly dozing off here. And when he would see their eyes bug up, he’d be like, oh, this is a good part. And I think Mark Twain was the one who said, leave out the parts that readers tend to skip. That’s the key to good writing. Leave out the parts that people tend to skip. I think that’s important to keep in mind too, is just write for yourself in a way that you like and get to the point and get out of people’s way after that.

I was reminded of a ‘scenario for analysis’ from Tavani’s book Ethics and Technology where the govt wants to round up people of a specific ‘group’ and you have a friend who you know to be a great person but is part of that group. What would you embrace? utilitarianism or deontology?\n2025-01-25 - Smith - Yes, Reshoring American Industry Is Possible - People thought that since US has outsourced all manufacturing and is totally an economy that produces services, it would be impossible to bring manufacturing.

The Readwise folder on this site contains all of my highlights from articles and books that gets automatically imported into Obsidian (This site is an Obsidian vault). I also try to update What I Read Last Week every weekend.\nI’ve embarked on a project to do a slow-reading (around 1-2 pages per day) of The Great Books of the Western World since 2023. I have a weekly newsletter - A Bibliophile’s Odyssey: Reading The Great Books where I provide a short summary and some thoughts that occurred while reflecting on what I read. I also started another project to read the Cybersecurity Canon recently.\n\nKey Links\n\n\n📄 About Me\n\n\n📁 Book Notes\n\n\n📁 General Posts\n\n\n📋 Book Lists - A List of Lists\n\n\n🔖 Tags\n\n\n📰 What I Read Last Week\n\n\nNewsletters\n\n\n\nJust for Fun!
