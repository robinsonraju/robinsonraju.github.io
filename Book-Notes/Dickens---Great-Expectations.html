<p>As I had mentioned in <a href="../posts/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/#primary-school" class="internal alias" data-slug="posts/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/index">My Reading Journey</a>, <strong>The Great Expectations</strong> was one of the first novels I read. I’ve read it so many times over the years, each time taking something away more than before.</p>
<p>Now I’m reading it after <strong>The Return of the Native</strong> and can’t help but compare the approaches of Hardy and Dickens. Both give us a glimpse of a period of time and a set of people that we become intimate with by reading. Through great dialogues, monologues, many times in the dialect of the locals, the readers get to know the emotional state of the protagonists at every juncture of their lives.</p>
<p>In this novel, we feel like Pip is narrating as he is living his life and not as a person who is recounting events from his past. The fear he feels with the convict, when he is harassed by the guests, when soldiers come to the door and he thinks they have come for him, his feelings for Estella, his feeling of hopelessness of being a blacksmith, and so on, everything is so well captured, that it is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Though there is an element of fate interfering withe lives of people in both the novels, I think fate is much more harsher in Hardy’s novel than in Dickens. I think the overarching narrative is that people ‘reap what they sow’ and usually get into difficult situations or fortunate ones depending on many of the decisions they make. Matthew Pocket, Herbert, Joe, Biddy are good throughout and they get rewarded in the end. Compeyson, Orlick, Pumblechook, Drummle, are not and they get punished. But, when I think of ‘The Return of the Native’, I think the narrative is that people don’t have a choice. They are just playthings in fate’s hands. Things will play out the way it needs to regardless of what people plan.</p>

<p>The novel starts with Pip, a boy standing near the graves of his parents and his dead brothers trying to imagine what they looked like. We get to know that he had named himself and Pip in his childhood and his actual name is Philip Pirip. He is brought up ‘by hand’ by his sister and brother in law. Brother in law, Joe Gargery, is a blacksmith.
Pip is interrupted by a large, dirty man with prison irons attached to his leg. He demands to know Pip’s name, turns him upside down to empty his pockets, He tells Pip to bring him some food and a file after he gets to know that his uncle is a blacksmith. He tells him that there is a young man with him who will tear is heart and liver out if he doesn’t oblige. Pip runs home frightened.</p>

<p>Pip returns to his home. His sister, who is 20 years senior to him, scolds him and asks him where he has been. She reminds him that she brought him up by hand and that he is a burden to her. Her husband, Joe is a mild-mannered person. Mrs. Joe gives Pip and Joe bread and butter fo supper. Pip hides his in his trousers. Joe is surprised that Pip bolted the bread and Mrs. Joe is upset that he swallowed the whole thing. She gives him tar-water as punishment.
They discuss about the escaped convicts when they hear gunshots. They live near the coast, near the marshland, where ships that form as jails are docked.
Next morning is Christmas day. Pip is not able to sleep in the night and early in the morning, he gets up, takes some more food from the pantry, some brandy and runs off to the marshes in search of the convict.</p>

<p>On his way, he sees man that he thinks is the convict, touches him and gets startled to know that the person is not the person as before. He thinks this is the young man the other man was talking about. The person runs away. Pip walks a bit more and finds the original convict and gives him food and the file. When Pip tells him about the other convict, this man is totally surprised. He gets to file away at the irons on his leg and ignores Pip. Pip slips away and runs towards home.</p>

<p>Pip rushes home thinking that his theft might have been found out. But is relieved to know that everyone is busy in dinner preparations for Christmas. They have some guests - Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle), Mr. Wopsle (church clerk who has a voice better than the priest) and Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. During dinner Mrs. Joe and Uncle Pumblechook focus on Pip and tell him that he has to be grateful towards his sister. Joe tries to console Pip by pouring some gravy into his plate. Mr. Pumblechook drinks the brandy from the bottle and spits it out discovering that it was tar-water. Pip is frightened thinking that his stealth will get discovered. He is about to run out of the home, opens the door and sees cops outside.</p>

<p>Pip is relieved when the soldiers say that they need the services of a blacksmith. So they did not arrive to catch him! The soldiers need help to repair handcuffs. Joe helps with it after that, when they set out to find the fugitives, Joe, Mr. Wopsle and pip join them. After a long search they find them. The two men are found fighting each other in a ditch. The convict tells the soldiers that he was capturing the other convict to bring him to the prison. The soldiers capture both men and take them to the station. Pip wonders if the convict would think that he led the soldiers to them. The convict tells the soldiers that he had stolen some food and file from the blacksmith’s home, thus clearing Pip’s name. Joe says it is ok.</p>

<p>Pip is not old enough to be apprenticed to Joe. So, he attends a school run by Mr. Wopsle’s great aunt. Mr. Wopsle is a tenant of one of the rooms in the building. The building also has a little general shop. The grand-aunt is helped by Biddy who is her grand-daughter. Pip comes home and tries to teach Joe what he has learnt. Joe is super impressed. When asked why Joe didn’t go to school, he talks about his childhood when his dad was a drunkard who beat up him and his mother. Since his mother was abused, he is very careful to note that he would never abuse his wife and is ok to take abuse from her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Joe makes occasional trips with Mr. Pumblechook on market days to assist him to buy household items since he was a bachelor and didn’t trust his servants. One of the days she returns with Mr. Pumblechook to inform Joe and Pip that a rich old lady, Ms. Havisham has asked for a boy and Mr. Pumblechook was gracious enough to suggest Pip. She is very happy and grateful to Mr. Pumblechook for the opportunity. Gets Pip cleaned up for the visit and leaves that night.</p>

<p>Pip stays with Mr. Pumblechook that night and is taken to Ms. Havisham’s mansion the next day. Pumblechook reminds him to be grateful for the opportunity to go into this great house. Though the house is big, it seems very old and not maintained. A gruff young lady greets them, lets only Pip in. While walking she mentions that the name of the house is Manor House or Satis House. She leaves him in a room which doesn’t have outside light coming in but has candles. Pip sees Ms. Havisham dressed in bridal clothes. They look grand but are old and yellow. She asks him to play and he is confused. She then asks him to call Estella. He calls her and they play cards. Estella beats him at the game and insults him for his looks and clothes throughout. He almost cries in front of Estella on the way back but holds back his tears. Pip is so embarrassed by himself that he kicks against a wall on the way back. He realizes that he is a low-life.</p>

<p>Pip returns home to find everyone very curious to know what happened. Mr. Pumblechook says that he has never seen Ms. Havisham but has had interactions with the house many times on business. Pip is uncomfortable since he is still sad about him being low in the social strata. He invents a story about Ms. Havisham sitting on a black velvet coach, Estella handing her cake and wine on a gold plate, and four large dogs fighting for veal cutlets from a silver basket. They are totally astonished.</p>
<p>Later Pip tells Joe the truth and he admonishes Pip to not tell lies.</p>

<p>Couple of days later Pip wakes up thinking - best step he could take towards making himself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew. So he goes over and learns from Biddy who is willing to help him with all that she knows.
One day, his sister tells Pip to get Joe from a public house named Three Jolly Bargemen on his way back from school, since he goes there in the evenings to smoke. Pip goes there and a man offers them a drink. Joe refuses but the man insists. Pip notices that the man is stirring his drink with the file that Pip had stolen in the past. He gets a fright thinking that his secret would be out. The man gives Pip a shilling wrapped in paper which turns out to be pound notes. Joe goes back thinking it was a mistake but are not able to find the man. Pip has a nightmare about the file in his sleep.</p>

<p>In the last meeting, Ms Havisham had told him to come after 6 days. The day comes and Pip makes a visit to the Manor House. Estella lets him in and takes him to a room where he sees some other people - 3 ladies and a man. A lady named Camilla, who reminded Pip of his sister, a man named Cousin Raymond, another lady named Sarah Pocket, another lady named Georgiana. They look at him and comment about him. He is then taken to another room where there is a wedding cake that is rotten and has insects crawling about them. Ms. Havisham holds Pip’s hand and goes around in the room. She says that when she dies, her body will be on the table with all the people watching.</p>
<p>Pip plays cards with Estella with Ms. Havisham watching. Estella continues to insult him. On his way back, a thin boy approaches him and challenges him for a fight. Pip knocks him down but he always gets up to fight. Finally he gives up. Estella who is waiting at the gate doesn’t ask him why he is late. She grants him a kiss. He kisses her but still feels like a downtrodden person.</p>

<p>Next time when he goes over to the Manor House, Pip is half expecting to be punished or scolded for beating up the thin boy. But he doesn’t find the boy anywhere nor is there any mention of him. He goes in and continues the regular thing of walking with Ms. Havisham in the room and playing with Estella. Sometimes the walk goes on for 3 hours. Ms. Havisham gets to know more about Pip, that he is set to be apprenticed to Joe when he grows older, etc. Pip is expected to go daily and that continues for many months.</p>
<p>One day, Ms. Havisham says Pip is old enough to be apprenticed and asks him to call Joe to the Manor House. He gets home and tells the news to Joe and Mrs. Joe. His sister is angry that she wasn’t invited and takes it out on Joe and Pip. She asks Joe why he didn’t marry a slave.</p>

<p>The next day, Pip, Joe and his sister go over to the town. His sister goes to Mr. Pumblechook’s place and Pip and Joe head over to Satis House. Estella opens the gate as usual, doesn’t take any notice of them and leads them to Ms. Havisham’s room. Ms. Havisham asks a few questions to them. Joe answers questions to Pip instead of to Ms. Havisham even for questions directed at him. It embarrasses Pip. Towards the end, Ms. Havisham gives a generous amount of 25 guineas and tells him to give it to his master, Joe.
They get back and tell Mrs. Joe and Mr. Pumblechook and they are very surprised at the amount given. As he goes back home, Pip realizes that the job that he once looked forward to, is not exciting anymore. He does not want to be a blacksmith.</p>

<p>Pip says that it is a miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. He once felt distinguished and happy merely at the thought of becoming Joe’s apprentice but not anymore. As he thinks back, he reminds himself of all the great qualities of Joe. The reason he did not run away or feel out of place, was not because he was virtuous, or faithful, it was because Joe was virtuous, Joe was faithful beyond measure.
Pip is haunted by the fear that Estella would come one day and see him with a black face and hands, dirtied by the job and consider him lower than she already thought and truly despise him.</p>

<p>Pip continues to work for Joe. Since he has grown, his education at Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s school is done. Biddy continues to teach him what she knows, Pip tries to learn things from Mr. Wopsle also. He tries to teach Joe what he knows it is not of much use.
One day, he asks Joe for half-day off to go to town and see Estella. Joe advises him against it telling him that Ms. Havisham might think that he has gone there to ask for something. Pip is insistent and Joe grants him his wish. Orlick, another chap who works with Joe also asks for half-day telling him that he should treat all employees equally. Joe relents. Mrs. Joe hears this and is totally furious. She asks Joe if he thinks he is so rich that he can afford to waste wages. Quarrel ensues between her and Orlick. Joe beats him up for talking bad to his wife.
Sunday comes and Pip goes to Satis House. Estella doesn’t open the gate, it is Sarah Pocket. Ms. Havisham tells him that Estella has gone away abroad to be educated to become a lady and is prettier than ever, hoping to taunt him.
Pip is in no mood to go home. But goes over slowly. On the way he hears some commotion, someone says there is something wrong at his place. He reaches home to find that someone has broken in and knocked down Mrs. Joe with a very hard blow on her head.</p>

<p>They discover that the blow was made with the leg-iron that the convict had filed away long back. Mrs. Joe is completely bedridden and Joe and Pip take care of her with difficulty. Mrs. Joe cannot talk and does not know to write.
Lucky for them, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt passes away and Biddy comes to stay with them. She nurses Mrs. Joe and takes care of others.
Mrs. Joe often used to write the symbol of T which Joe or Pip never understood. Biddy surmises that it could mean a hammer. They realize that Mrs. Joe means to say Orlick. They bring in Orlick thinking that she will denounce him as the person who hit her but she is friendly with him and he comes by often after that.</p>

<p>Pip goes to Satis Manor on his birthday to visit Ms. Havisham. She gives him a guinea and tells him to come next yr during his birthday. Pip becomes conscious of Biddy changing into a neat young lady, though not as beautiful as Estella. He asks Biddy how she manages to take care of the house and also catch up with him on all the reading and learning. She reminds him jokingly that she is his first teacher. Pip has heartfelt conversations with Biddy on how he feels. He tells her that he wishes he could be happy as a blacksmith and be with Joe and her but he is not, he wants to be a gentleman. When he tells her than it is on account of a young lady at Ms. Havisham’s, Biddy asks if he wants to be a gentleman to spite her or to win her. She gives the sage advice that both reasons are not good enough and that the lady is not worth winning over. Pip tells her frankly that it would have been easier if he was in love with her than with Estella. Biddy doesn’t mind it and is thankful for his confidence. On the way back home, they meet Orlick and both hate to be with him. She says he has eyes on her and that’s why she doesn’t like him, but it shouldn’t be of Pip’s concern. They get home. Pip’s dissatisfaction with life keep growing and he says that the confusion is fifty thousand fold and is scattering his wits.</p>
<p>This is probably the most poignant part of the story yet. One feels sad for Pip, sad for Biddy, and sad for being in a place of unhappiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>”Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?” Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>”I don’t know,” I moodily answered.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>”Because if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”</em></p>

Pip and Joe go with him to Joe’s home, and Mr. Jaggers, the lawyer tells them that an anonymous patron wants to gift a property to Pip and fund his training to become a gentleman. At the beginning, Mr. Jaggers asks Joe if he wants money or some form of compensation for relieving Pip from his apprenticeship. Joe says no. Mr. Jaggers tells them that Pip will live in London and he can take training from anyone. Since he doesn’t know anyone, Jaggers suggests Mr. Mathew Pocket whom he has heard of. Pip quickly makes the connection to Ms. Havisham since he had heard the name there. Jaggers gives him money to buy clothes. Joe is dumbfounded. Jaggers again asks if Joe needs any money for the loss of Pip’s services and he says no. When Jaggers insists, Joe gets upset. Jaggers leaves. Pip decides that he will buy clothes but not wear them from the village, lest everyone see. He will wear them from Pumblechook’s home and go to London. Pip tells Biddy and she is happy with the news. Though Joe and Biddy are cheerful, Pip is gloomy at the prospect of leaving. But he is also looking forward to leaving.</p>

<p>Pip prepares to leave to town to shop for clothes. He mentions to Joe that if he could read or ‘get on a little more’ with the lessons, he could have come with him to London. Joe mentions that he is awfully dull and it is better for him here. Pip mentions the same to Biddy and she tells him that Joe might actually like it here in the village than in London. Pip thinks it is because of her jealousy. Biddy says he can think what he wants to. Pip goes over to the town. Pumblechook is totally a changed man to him now. He ingratiates himself to Pip by giving him the best food, shaking his hands many times and praises him often. Pip gets his new clothes and dresses himself up in those and goes over to Satis House. Sarah Pocket receives him at the gate and he gets to meet Ms. Havisham who already knows about his good fortune from Mr. Jaggers. Pip goes back to Pumblechook’s place, changes clothes and goes to his village. His packs up and bids good bye to Joe and Biddy, who bid him a tearful good-bye. When he reaches the finger-post at the end of the village, he is also overcome with emotion and sheds a tear. He goes on, towards town, taking a coach, changing coaches along the way and onward to London.</p>

<p>Pip gets to London. He is scared by the immensity of London and does not like the ugly, crooked, narrow and dirty roads. He goes to Mr. Jaggers’s office and finds out that he is in the court. He is asked to wait in the room. There are many others waiting for Jaggers. When Jaggers comes in he sees how others are scared of him. Jaggers tells him that he is to ramain with Mr. Pocket’s son at Barnard’s Inn, until Monday and then go to Mr. Pocket’s home. He was given generous allowance and cards of many tradesmen from whom he could make purchases.</p>

<p>Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers’ assistant, takes Pip over to Barnard’s Inn and Pip is not very impressed by the Inn from outside. Pip views it as an imperfect realization of one of his first great expectations. When they reach the room, they don’t find young Mr. Pocket there. Instead they find a note that says ‘Gone out, back shortly’. Wemmick goes away and Pip waits for the young man to come. He takes a bit of time but eventually comes. He says that he had gone out to the market to get some fruits for Pip. When they get to see each other, Pip realizes that the young boy is the same ‘pale young gentleman’ that he had beaten up at Satis House, for which he got a kiss from Estella! Both are surprised.</p>

<p>Pip finds that Herbert, Mr. Pocket’s son, is a very amiable person. He tells him that Estella was adopted by Ms. Havisham and that he didn’t care much for being betrothed to her. During dinner, Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham’s story. While eating, he also teaches Pip upper class manners whenever a chance comes. He gives Pip the name of Handel, after a famous composer.</p>
<p>This quote about Pip’s impression of Herbert, caught my eye -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, <strong>a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean</strong>. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would <strong>never be very successful or rich</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stopped reading the book and thought about myself at that moment!</p>
<p>Ms. Havisham’s Story - Ms. Havisham’s father was a country gentleman and also a brewer. After her mother died when she was young, her father denied her nothing and in his doting, he made her a spoit child. Her father married a servant in secret and had another child, Ms. Havisham’s half brother. As the son grew, he turned out to be a rogue. The father disinherited him and he was out to take revenge. Ms. Havisham falls in love with a showy man who pretends to be a gentleman. But he stands her up during her wedding. It turns out that the man was friends with the half-brother and this was an act of revenge. Ms. Havisham is devastated. Time stops and she has been in her wedding dress with all the arrangements including the cake not being touched or removed after that.</p>
<p>Herbert says that he works in a counting house who is planning to get into trading in the future. Pip makes a visit to Mr. Pocket’s house after a few days. He finds Mrs. Pocket sitting at a place and reading not bothering about her children. Two maid servants take care of the kids. Mr. Pocket is a good man but is overwhelmed by having so many kids (7 kids).</p>

<p>Mr. Pocket is happy to see Pip and hopes that Pip also finds it good to be tutored by him.
Mrs. Pocket is the daughter of a knight and was brought up as a lady so that she could be an ornamental wife to a man of title. She ends up marrying Mr. Pocket against her dad’s wishes. She is unable to manage her household which is run by the servants. She resents being an incapable person and laments her fall from being nobility.
Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and Cambridge and had distinguished himself, but he ruined his prospects by marrying early and to the wrong person. He had to take up tutoring to maintain his family. He is sad about his lost chances and tries to get a break as a favor from one of the parents of the youth he tutors. Though they promise him something, after the education is done, they forget.
Ms. Coiler, a snoopy neighbor, tries to get close to Pip and tells him that Mrs. Pocket thinks it is humiliating that her husband has to tutor.</p>

<p>Pip takes a long walk with Mr. Pocket and gets advice on how to improve. He like Mr. Pocket.
He travels to and fro between his apartment at St. Barnard which he shares with Herbert and Mr. Pocket’s home.
He goes to Jaggers and requests for money to buy furniture and Jaggers is generous and asks his clerk Wemmick to write a check. Wemmick introduces him to other clerks and also gives him a glimpse of what type of personality Jaggers is. He tells him about the two masks on Jaggers desk, that they were of two famous clients. He takes Pip to court to see Jaggers in action and Pip is very impressed at the respect and fear that Jaggers commands.</p>

<p>Other students of Mr. Pocket are introduced. Bentley Drummle is a rich spoilt kid who is a blockhead. Startop is a kid who is spoilt by over affection from his mother.
After a couple of months, Mr. Pocket is visited by the relatives of Ms. Havisham that Pip had met in the past. They are Mr and Mrs. Camilla and Georgiana. Camilla is Mr.Pocket’s sister. Georgiana is a cousin. They don’t have much regard for Mr.Pocket though.
Pip decides to visit Wemmick since he had invited him home. They walk to the home and get talking. Wemmick tells Pip that Jaggers never locks his door and challenges anyone to rob him.
Pip reaches the home and finds it to be a fancy one. Wemmick calls it ‘The Castle’. He designed, architected and built the home. It even has a drawbridge and canon (named Stinger). He has an elderly father who he calls ‘The Aged’. There is a little girl who takes care of the Aged. The dinner is excellent and Pip is very pleased.</p>

<p>Pip gets a letter from Biddy informing him that Joe is coming to London with Mr. Wopsle and he would like to visit him and if Pip is not available, he could leave a message.
Pip is not quite looking forward to the meeting since he is embarrassed by Joe. He is relieved that Joe was coming to Barnard’s Inn and not to Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket’s home) since he didn’t want Drummle to meet Joe and judge Pip that he has relatives of low status.
Pip has furnished his apartment very lavishly and even has a servant whom he calls The Avenger.
Joe comes and it is evident that he is not very comfortable in the lavish settings. While they were talking Herbert comes in and is excited to see Joe and talks to him well. Joe tells them that he is in town to see Mr. Wopsle act in a play. Wopsle had left church and now was a full time actor.
After Herbert is gone, Joe tells Pip that he is actually here as a messenger. Ms. Havisham had asked to see him and that Estella was in town. She had sent a word through Pumblechook. Biddy had told Joe that it might be better to inform Pip by word than by letter.
Joe doesn’t stay for dinner and goes away.</p>

<p>Pip decides to make a visit to Satis House. He does a lot of thinking about what to do. Should he stay at Joe’s place? Should he take the Avenger? What if Trabb’s boy tells Avenger unsavory things about his childhood? etc. He decides to stay at the Blue Boar Inn and not to take the Avenger.
Pip finds that in the coach that he takes, two convicts are also being transported. He recognizes one person as the one who gave him two one pound notes. Pip tries his best to avoid the convicts and being recognized.
The convicts don’t have a place in the back so they are put in the front much to the dismay of other passengers.
Pip overhears the convicts talking and one of them says that another person had asked him to give two one pound notes to a boy who had fed him and kept his secret. He had done it, though his companion tells him that it was a foolish thing to do hinting that he should have just taken the money. He goes on to say that the other man got charged for escaping prison and got a life sentence.
Pip gets even more alarmed after hearing the conversation thinking that he convict might recognize him soon. So as soon as the town comes, he gets down and walks the rest of the way. At the Inn, the waiter recognizes him and asks if he should send for Mr. Pumblechook. Pip says no and the waiter puts a dirty old copy of a local newspaper where Pip finds Pumblechook mentioned as the founder of Pip’s fortunes.</p>

<p>Pip wakes up early and goes for a walk and gets thinking, day-dreaming about Ms. Havisham’s brilliant plans for him. He thinks that as she adopted Estella, she adopted him also and is planning to see them united. He also thinks that she has left the house is disrepair so that he could restore the house to its glory. He realizes that he loves Estella against reason, against promise, against all discouragement.
Later in the morning, he goes to Satis House and is surprised to find Orlick opening the gate. He tells that he left the forge after Pip left and joined as a porter here. Pip goes along the corridor to meet Ms. Havisham and meets Sarah Pocket on the way. He tells her that Mr. Pocket and family are well.
There is a young lady by Ms. Havisham’s side whom Pip doesn’t recognize. But when she lifts her eyes, he recognizes that it is Estella. She has returned from France and is to go to London to be introduced to society.
Later, Pip and Estella walk around the property and Estella tells Pip that she had watched Pip and Herbert fight, in secret. Pip remembers the kiss that she granted him but she doesn’t.
Estella tells him that she doesn’t remember anything in the past with emotion because she doesn’t have a heart. She has never felt love.
When they get back, they learn that Mr. Jaggers will be dining with them. During dinner, Pip notices that Mr. Jaggers doesn’t give much regard to Estella. He prods Mr. Jaggers about Estella’s past and whether she is Ms. Havisham’s daughter or not. He doesn’t get much from Jaggers.
After dinner Pip goes back to the Boar deciding to sleep there and head for London the next day, without paying a visit to Joe.</p>

<p>At the Blue Boar, Pip tells Mr. Jaggers that Orlick may not the right sort of person to work at Ms. Havisham’s and tells him some of his past. Jaggers agrees to fire him right away. While Pip is afraid to deal with a person like Orlick, Jaggers seems to relish in that. Pip goes into town. He is proud in his gentlemanly clothes and people seem to respect him. He sees Trabb’s boy on the way and gets upset when he imitates and mocks him. As soon as he reaches London, Pip sends codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe as an apology for not visiting. In the next day’s post, he also writes a letter to Mr. Trabb saying that he will not do business with him due to the boy’s conduct.</p>
<p>Pip confesses to Herbert about his love for Estella which Herbert had already guessed. Herbert also mentions to him that since Mr. Jaggers never mentioned Estella, marrying her may not be a condition or wish from his benefactor who he thinks is probably Ms. Havisham. He also warns him that Estella will make him miserable considering the way she has been raised. Of course, Pip doesn’t heed the advice.</p>
<p>Herbert also confides in Pip about him being engaged to a girl named Clara who he likes but is below his mother’s nonsensical family notions. Pip and Herbert go to see Mr. Wopsle’s play.</p>

<p>The play doesn’t go well. Some actors are coughing, some have forgotten the lines, audience keep interrupting, etc. Pip and Herbert rush to go out in order to escape meeting Mr. Wopsle but they are stopped by a Jewish man who tells them that Mr. Waldengarver is expecting to see them. That turns out to be Mr. Wopsle. Pip and Herbert are polite to him and say that his acting was good. Pip invites him from supper. He is sad while going to bed and a miserable dream about this expectations being cancelled, he had to marry Herbert’s Clara or play Hamlet before thousands of people without knowing the words.</p>

<p>Estella and Pip get into a carriage to go to Richmond in Surrey which is around 10 miles. During the journey they talk and Pip’s naïveté comes across clearly when he speaks to Estella. She tells him that Ms. Havisham’s relatives write nasty letters about him, sometime anonymously to Ms. Havisham. Pip is surprised that they mean harm to him. Estella assures him that they will never succeed in their machinations against him. On the way they see Newgate prison and Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket’s place).

<p>Couple of years pass by. Pip is twenty three. Pip &amp; Herbert had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year, and lived in the Temple, in Garden-court, down by the river Thames. He has parted with Mr. Pocket also and he maintained good relationship with him.</p>
<p>One night, when Herbert was away on Business to Marseilles, Pip receives a mysterious visitor who asks for him. After he comes in, Pip realizes that he is the convict that Pip had saved many years ago. The convict calls him ‘noble Pip’. He reveals to Pip that he is the patron and Pip is stunned. The convict goes on to tell him how hard he worked to make Pip a gentleman and that he is very proud now. He also tells him that he has come to London illegally with the sole purpose of seeing Pip, to see the fruit of his labor of making someone a gentleman.</p>
<p>Pip is devastated by the news. He thinks of Estella and is sad that since Ms. Havisham was not the benefactor, there was never an indirect plan of Ms. Havisham keeping Estella for him.</p>

<p>In the morning Pip realizes that keeping the convict hidden would not be easy at all. The Avenger was not in his service anymore. He had an old lady as maid and her niece. Asking them to not go to a room would arouse suspicion. So he decides to tell them that the convict is his uncle. It is still early morning and is dark. When he goes out, he stumbles against someone on the stairs. Pip chats with the watchman at the gate and finds out that when Pip’s uncle came in in the night, there was another man who had followed him.</p>
<p>Pip comes back to his quarters and finds that the convict has woken up. He comes out of his room and Pip doesn’t like his shabby looks. Pip tells him that he’s told others that he is his uncle and the convict is pleased. He said he has taken the name of Provis while here. Pip asks if he was followed yesterday to which Provis replies he didn’t know.</p>
<p>During breakfast, Pip notices that Provis ate in a ravenous way and his manners were uncouth. Pip is very uneasy and does not like the man at all. Provis tosses a pocket-book bursting with money and tells Pip that all he has is Pip’s and he would like Pip to spend it on luxuries. He says he would be proud to show off Pip to all the people in the past who looked down upon him. Pip is even more worried and asks for his plans. The convict says he intends to stay there as Provis and it should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Pip goes over to Mr. Jaggers and asks him. Jaggers confirms that the convict, whose actual name is Abel Magwitch is the real benefactor. He still refers to Magwitch and Provis and two different people. Magwitch being in Australia and Provis being another person who is representing him in London. Pip buys Provis some new clothes. Herbert arrives back from his trip and is introduced to Provis who swears him to secrecy about him.</p>

<p>Pip tells Herbert about the convict being his benefactor and that he is there illegally and wants to go by the name of Provis and live a life of luxury. Pip and Herbert agree that the best course of action is to somehow get the man out of England and try to explain to him that he is in danger if he remains in London. Pip also decides to stop accepting any more money from Provis though he is deep in debt. Since he has not been trained for any trade, he feels like he is good for nothing and being a soldier is his only option. Herbert tells him that he could always work at Clarriker.

<p>During the next day breakfast, Provis tells them about his past. He grew up as an orphan on the streets, surviving by stealing small things or begging. He does not even know how he got the name Abel Magwitch. Around 20 years back, at Epsom races, he met a gentleman by the name of Compeyson. A person whom he would kill right now if he met him, he is the person who Magwitch was fighting with on the ditch as a convict many years back. Compeyson befriends Magwitch and tells him to be his partner. Magwitch finds that Compeyson is not the gentleman he looks like, his business is actually swindling, handwriting forging, stolen-bank notes, etc. There was another man named Arthur who was living with Compeyson in his home upstairs. Arthur was sick and was tended to by Compeyson’s wife out of pity. Arthur has hallucinations of a broken-hearted woman who was going to come for him. He and Compeyson had swindled a rich woman of lot of money in the past. Arthur dies after some time due to his sickness and hallucinations. Compeyson and Magwitch go about swindling and forgery, with Magwitch doing all the work and Compeyson underpaying him. They eventually get caught but the judge passes harsher sentence on Magwitch by his looks and lighter one on Compeyson thinking that he was a gentleman who was influenced badly by Magwitch.
During the imprisonment, Magwitch escapes and he gets to know from Pip that Compeyson had also escaped. So he fights with Compeyson and makes sure to put him in jail though it costs him his freedom.</p>
<p>Herbert passes Pip a note telling him that “Young Havisham’s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham’s lover.”</p>
