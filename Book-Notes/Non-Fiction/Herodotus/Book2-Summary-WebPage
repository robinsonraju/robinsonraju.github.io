    <!-- Chosen Palette: Papyrus Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is organized into five thematic sections (Nile, Customs, Gods, Kings, Wonders) accessible via a top navigation bar. This non-linear structure allows users to explore topics of interest freely, rather than following the book's narrative sequentially. The core interaction is a horizontal timeline of kings, making the dense historical information digestible and engaging. A bar chart compares reign lengths for a quantitative overview. This design prioritizes user-driven exploration and thematic understanding over a simple text summary. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Kings' Reigns: Goal: Compare historical periods. Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Tooltips on hover. Justification: Provides a quick visual comparison of the duration and impact of key rulers. 2. Timeline of Kings: Goal: Organize chronology. Method: Interactive HTML/CSS timeline. Interaction: Clicking a king's name reveals a detailed info card (JS). Justification: Breaks down the long, complex list of monarchs into manageable, explorable segments. 3. Egyptian Customs: Goal: Inform/Organize. Method: Grid of info cards (HTML/Tailwind). Interaction: Simple, clear presentation. Justification: Highlights the unique cultural aspects Herodotus noted in an easily scannable format. NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            <p class="text-lg text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-12">Herodotus famously called Egypt "the gift of the river." He was captivated by the Nile's mysterious annual flooding, which was the lifeblood of the nation. He dismissed the common Greek theories and proposed his own, showcasing his method of inquiry and rational thought.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Herodotus's Investigation</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">Herodotus systematically rejected three prevailing Greek explanations for the Nile's summer floods:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Etesian Winds:</strong> He argued that the winds often didn't blow, yet the Nile still flooded, and other rivers facing these winds didn't behave similarly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flow from the Ocean:</strong> He dismissed this as an unscientific and "marvellous" tale rooted in myth, not observation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Melting Snows:</strong> He found this impossible, reasoning that a river flowing from the hottest regions of the world (Libya and Ethiopia) could not be fed by snow.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">His Own Theory</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">Herodotus's own hypothesis, while incorrect, was based on his understanding of meteorology:</p>
                    <p class="text-lg">During winter, the sun is driven by storms into the "upper parts of Libya" (the south). There, it evaporates vast quantities of water from the Nile's sources, keeping the river low. When summer arrives, the sun returns to its normal path in the north. No longer subjected to this intense evaporation, the Nile's waters are free to swell and flood the lands of Egypt.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-12">Herodotus was convinced that Greek religion was heavily indebted to Egypt.

            <p class="text-lg text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-12">The architectural achievements of the Egyptians left Herodotus in awe. He considered their greatest works to surpass even the finest structures of the Greeks, testifying to the immense power and resources of the pharaohs.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Herodotus attributes the Great Pyramids to the tyrannical reigns of Cheops and Chephren. He reports that the Great Pyramid took 100,000 men, working in three-month shifts, a total of 20 years to complete. An inscription, he was told, recorded the vast sums spent on radishes, onions, and garlic for the laborers.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">More impressive to Herodotus than even the pyramids, the Labyrinth was a massive complex near Lake Moeris. He claimed it contained twelve roofed courts and three thousand chambers, half above ground and half below. He described it as a bewildering maze of passages from courts to rooms to colonnades that "excelled all other human productions."</p>

His brother Chephren (reigned 56 years) continued this oppressive rule, building the second pyramid. The Egyptians so hated their memory that they would not even speak their names.'

When Psammetichus used his bronze helmet for lack of a golden cup, the other kings exiled him. Another oracle promised him vengeance from "brazen men from the sea," which was fulfilled when Ionian and Carian pirates in bronze armor landed in Egypt. With their help, he defeated the other kings and became sole ruler.'
