      <description>Thoughts This was the first Thomas Hardy novel that I&amp;rsquo;d read, probably during my engineering days, and re-reading it brings a lot of memories back. What I realize is that I got the gist of the story but had missed out on a lot of details that Hardy provides.</description>

Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.</description>
