<blockquote class="blockquote_attr">
  <p>
    <i><p>I shot an arrow into the air,<br>
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br>
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight<br>
Could not follow it in its flight.</p>
<p>I breathed a song into the air,<br>
It fell to earth, I knew not where;<br>
For who has sight so keen and strong,<br>
That it can follow the flight of song?</p>
<p>Long, long afterward, in an oak<br>
I found the arrow, still unbroke;<br>
And the song, from beginning to end,<br>
I found again in the heart of a friend.</p>

That perches in the soul<br>

<blockquote class="blockquote_attr">
  <p>
    <i><p>As you set out for Ithaka<br>
hope your road is a long one,<br>
full of adventure, full of discovery.<br>
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:<br>
you’ll never find things like that on your way<br>
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,<br>
as long as a rare excitement<br>
stirs your spirit and your body.<br>
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them<br>
unless you bring them along inside your soul,<br>
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.</p>
<p>Hope your road is a long one.<br>
May there be many summer mornings when,<br>
with what pleasure, what joy,<br>
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;<br>
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations<br>
to buy fine things,<br>
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br>
sensual perfume of every kind—<br>
as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br>
and may you visit many Egyptian cities<br>
to learn and go on learning from their scholars.</p>
<p>Keep Ithaka always in your mind.<br>
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.<br>
But don’t hurry the journey at all.<br>
Better if it lasts for years,<br>
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,<br>
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,<br>
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.</p>
<p>Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.<br>
Without her you wouldn&rsquo;t have set out.<br>
She has nothing left to give you now.</p>
<p>And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.<br>
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,<br>
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote_attr">
  <p>
    <i><p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,</p>
<p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.</p>

    <i><p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  <br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;  <br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  <br>
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  <br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;  <br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  <br>
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  <br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>

I love thee with the passion put to use<br>
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.<br>
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br>
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,<br>
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,<br>

<blockquote class="blockquote_attr">
  <p>
    <i><p>I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
That floats on high o&rsquo;er vales and hills,<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
<p>Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
<p>The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br>
In such a jocund company:<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>
<p>For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.</p>

And evening full of the linnet’s wings.</p>

Love&rsquo;s not Time&rsquo;s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
Within his bending sickle&rsquo;s compass come;<br>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>
If this be error and upon me prov&rsquo;d,<br>
I never writ, nor no man ever lov&rsquo;d.</p>

    <i><p>No man is an island,<br>
Entire of itself,<br>
Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
A part of the main.</p>
<p>If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
Europe is the less.<br>
As well as if a promontory were.<br>
As well as if a manor of thy friend&rsquo;s<br>
Or of thine own were:</p>
<p>Any man&rsquo;s death diminishes me,<br>
Because I am involved in mankind,<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
It tolls for thee.</p>

    <i><p>How does a part of the world leave the world?<br>
How does wetness leave water?</p>
<p>Dont&rsquo; try to put out fire by throwing on<br>
more fire! Don&rsquo;t wash a wound with blood.</p>
<p>No matter how fast you run, your shadow<br>
keeps up. Sometimes it&rsquo;s in front!</p>
<p>Only full overhead sun diminishes your shadow.<br>
But that shadow has been serving you.</p>
<p>What hurts you, blesses you. Darkness is<br>
your candle. Your boundaries are your quest.</p>
<p>I could explain this, but it will break the<br>
glass cover on your heart, and there&rsquo;s no fixing that.</p>
<p>You must have shadow and light source both.<br>
Listen, and lay your head under the tree of awe.</p>
<p>When from that tree feathers and wings sprout on you,<br>
be quieter than a dove. Don&rsquo;t even open your mouth for even a coo.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote_attr">
  <p>
    <i><p>Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching.<br>
And he said:</p>
<p>No man can reveal to you aught<br>
but that which already lies<br>
half asleep in the dawning<br>
of your knowledge.</p>
<p>The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple,<br>
among his followers,<br>
gives not of his wisdom<br>
but rather of his faith and his lovingness.</p>
<p>If he is indeed wise he does not bid<br>
you enter the house of his wisdom,<br>
but rather leads you<br>
to the threshold of your own mind.</p>
<p>The astronomer may speak to you<br>
of his understanding of space,<br>
but he cannot give you<br>
his understanding.</p>
<p>The musician may sing to you<br>
of the rhythm which is in all space,<br>
but he cannot give you the ear which arrests<br>
the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it.</p>
<p>And he who is versed in the science of numbers<br>
can tell of the regions of weight and measure,<br>
but he cannot conduct<br>
you thither.</p>
<p>For the vision of one man lends not<br>
its wings to another man.<br>
And even as each one of you stands<br>
alone in God’s knowledge,<br>
so must each one of you be<br>
alone in his knowledge of God<br>
and in his understanding of the earth.</p>
