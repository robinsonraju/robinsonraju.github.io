    <div class="post-content">
      <p>I could not help but think of this quote from &ldquo;The Mill on the Floss&rdquo; when someone asked me a question about how to do well in an Engineering Manager interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>.. it is always chilling, in friendly intercourse, to say you have no opinion to give. And if you deliver an opinion at all, it is mere stupidity not to do it with an air of conviction and well-founded knowledge.</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, I gave my thought, emphasizing the fact that though there may be many things that you could improve to do well, most of the times, it is not you. The employer may just have too many candidates who are very good fits for the position and might even have used &lsquo;Optimal Stopping&rsquo; <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. So, the only option is to keep trying.</p>
<p>But it also set me thinking about general questions that one might ask as a hiring manager to someone you want to hire. Assuming that it is a telephone interview for 45 minutes or an onsite interview after the person has gone through System Design and other technical rounds. I think even if you give the candidates a list of questions that you would ask, the way a person answers, with specific examples will help you gauge if they are the right leader for your organization or not. In that way, it is different from SWE interview in which if you know the questions ahead of time, you could whiteboard the most optimal solution. I&rsquo;m not saying that thinking on the feet is not important for an Eng Manager, of course it is more critical, but that the questions could focus on prior experience of problem solving situations. By asking questions based on the answers, one can weed out people who might fabricate something.</p>
<p>As Brene Brown says &ldquo;I want to live in a world with braver, bolder leaders&rdquo;. Especially when one sees too many examples of sloppy leadership that impacts the joy of living for so many people. Here is a quote from &ldquo;Daring Greatly&rdquo; -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;When I think about my personal experiences with leading over the past few years, the only endeavors that have required the same level of self-awareness and equally high-level “comms plans” are being married for twenty-four years and parenting. And that’s saying something. I completely underestimated the pull on my emotional bandwidth, the sheer determination it takes to stay calm under pressure, and <strong>the weight of continuous problem solving and decision making</strong>. Oh, yeah—and the sleepless nights.&quot;</em> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
(emphasis by me)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the key goal is to gauge how effective that person would be in a continuous problem solving environment. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve promoted a few folks to first time Engineering Managers, conducted a lot of interviews of very talented people who wanted to join the company as Eng Managers. My questions were generally very simple and someone who has &lsquo;been there, done that&rsquo;, would easily be able to answer with specific examples of scenarios where they did this or that.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;problem&rsquo; could be related to a production incident that needs to be handled asap, a design decision to give inputs on which path is better to meet the objectives, asked to take up a project without clear or any requirements, performance issues of the system, people related issues, setting up of goals and vision for the team that is overdue, status reports to upper management, and so on. How to deal with multiple things by prioritizing the right things at the right time is the key to being effective. Of course, there are frameworks in place in most successful companies to make sure that employees are as effective as possible.</p>
<p>I would say one question in each of the following areas would help to determine if the person is a <strong>great</strong> fit.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest</strong> - Sample question. &ldquo;Why are you interested in this job?&quot;. There are many variants of this and the main objective is to find out - What makes you qualified? Why did you get into management? How big of a team are you comfortable managing? What kind of challenges do you like, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hiring</strong> - &ldquo;What do you look for when you hire someone?&quot;. The discussion around this area would be to find out - Are you hiring for a fit into the team? Are you hiring to raise the bar? Are you hiring with diversity in mind? etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Skill</strong> - &ldquo;Tell me of a time when you recommended a technology but did not get accepted?&quot;. The discussions around this would be the find out - Are you abreast with technology that we&rsquo;re using? Do you have a good handle on technologies that you&rsquo;ve mentioned in your resume? Can you agree/disagree logically with architects and tech leads, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Management</strong> -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong> -</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I generally used to ask a question on process, especially around CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) since I think that makes a huge difference in building and maintaining highly scalable software systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back and edit this post. Regarding materials to read, I would suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897/">The Manager&rsquo;s Path</a> or other books mentioned in my article on <a href="/blog/2020-07-03-reading-list-leadership/">Leadership - Essential Books</a>.</p>
