        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-09-05-plan-b/ -&lt;p&gt;Happened to watch the first 3 episodes of &lt;strong&gt;Raised by Wolves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I was expecting just an episode to get launched in the typical HBO fashion. But getting 3 episodes was a bonus. Though I would have preferred to just have one. It would have given enough time to think about the episode and read articles about it till the next one came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the &amp;lsquo;best of times&amp;rsquo; for the sci-fi genre as a whole. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next seasons of &lt;strong&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;The Expanse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The trailer for the &lt;strong&gt;Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; series on Apple TV was awesome though I wish it were available on Prime. Also, expecting Robert Jordan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to be engaging and thought-provoking. Not sure if the &lt;strong&gt;LOTR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; TV series could better Peter Jackson&amp;rsquo;s movies, but it would be interesting to see. I wish there were more seasons of &lt;strong&gt;The Man in the High Castle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe that they are thinking of rebooting &lt;strong&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There is also &lt;strong&gt;Dune&lt;/strong&gt; movie&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and TV series&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on the horizon with the promise that it would be better now than all the adaptations in the past. There are many more than what someone could hope to watch. I think there is something for every science buff out there. A time of abundance indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was impressed by &amp;lsquo;Raised by Wolves&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve liked other sci-fi movies by Ridley Scott - Alien&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Prometheus&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, etc. The tech is always impressive and one is hopeful for the better future that is in store for us. But while the earlier movies had life of earth as peaceful and humans exploring distant places on the universe, this one is about humans being forced to evacuate due to strife on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It aligns with the current divided world that we&amp;rsquo;re living in. I think, just a couple of decades ago, the majority of people were optimistic about technology and the future in general. But now, the clock seems to have dialed back to world war times. Issues like religious intolerance and racism which were solved 50 years ago or before, are in the forefront. Social media seems to have given power to the fringe elements than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backdrop of &amp;lsquo;Raised by Wolves&amp;rsquo; is that humanity is fighting against each other and is on the brink of extinction. What are they fighting about? Religion of course. The atheists manage to send a small spacecraft with a couple of androids and 12 embryos to Kepler-22b, a habitable planet that is about 60 light-years from the earth. The believers of the Mithraic cult send an ark with around 1000 people to the same destination. The show starts with a nuclear explosion on earth being seen far away from the first spacecraft, which implies that earth is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The belief that people will destroy earth, seems to be a foregone conclusion by a lot of thinking people. It is so sad to even think of it. My view is that no one should possess any weapon that could destroy the whole earth. But the invention cannot be undone. Humanity as a whole is immature, and now the children have big toys to wipe everything out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idealists think that a small group can run away and build a new civilization without the bigotry and narrow mindedness. The androids in RBW believe the same. They think that they could give humanity a reboot by starting afresh with 12 embryos on a new planet. But that has been tried so many times on earth itself. Wherever humans go, trouble follows sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the better bet would be to just send androids to a new planet to colonize. i.e, when AI becomes more mature. If AI reaches the 2nd level (AGI - Artificial General Intelligence) as mentioned in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html&#34;&gt;Wait buy why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; article, then they may be able to independently create robots and androids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if just androids are sent to a new planet, say Mars, they are going with morality that is being put into them by humans. Depending on which country or culture they are sent from, they could be biased. If bias by smart and efficient people on earth is so disadvantageous to the marginalized, then bias from things that are multiple times smarter would be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If AGI gets being created by consuming all the digital material available today, then we&amp;rsquo;re already on the wrong path. In the last 10 years alone with the explosion of social media, so much of junk has been put on the digital world that they don&amp;rsquo;t represent the best of humanity at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the Plan B of going out of earth should not be a solution. People need to get ahead of the fundamental differences that exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been proven over and again that monarchy, fascism, communism, or any ideology that divides people is not a solution. Bigotry and hatred can only lead to destruction. Getting a better understanding and believing that humanity is one species and every person is 99.9% similar to other, is the key. Yes, a positive and generous worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-01-18-21_lessons/&#34;&gt;21 lessons for 21st century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, secularism is a positive and active worldview. It is not opposed to religion. Secularism views morality and wisdom as the natural legacy of all humans, not something handed down from God to a specific set of humans at a point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secular Ideals -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commitment to truth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compassion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commitment to equality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherish Responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of films like Alien or Prometheus or TV series like The Expanse, that I like, is the belief that &lt;strong&gt;there is life out there&lt;/strong&gt;. The universe is so vast. Though the probability of conditions to create life is so tiny, the universe is so vast that the probability is quite real.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Money Effect</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-30-the-money-effect/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-30-the-money-effect/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-30-the-money-effect/ -&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Money is the root of all evil&amp;rdquo; took a different meaning in my mind when I read this portion (&lt;a href=&#34;#quote&#34;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; below) from &lt;strong&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/strong&gt;. Set me thinking about different interactions with people in the past and different kinds of projects and people&amp;rsquo;s attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came to mind were transformations in people when the goal was changed from &amp;lsquo;doing something to benefit someone&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;doing something to meet a financial target&amp;rsquo;. That even the best of teams could set out to build a scalable platform might take shortcuts to launch something if money is the target. There is an urgency that sets in when money is the focus which makes many other things oblivious. I think companies and teams should always have users as the target rather than the revenue goal itself. It is probably better to visualize the customer and the impact that we might be having to their livelihood. That is way more empowering in my opinion. Of course, there are many companies who do this really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when someone hints at money&amp;rsquo;s corrupting effects, people usually respond with &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2006-03-19-francisco-d-anconia-speech-money&#34;&gt;Francisco d&amp;rsquo;Anconia&amp;rsquo;s speech&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/strong&gt; or something similar that looks at it from value and effort. The speech is right in its way of looking at things, but is wrong in so many other ways. Nothing is black and white ever. If money represents value and labor, why is a disproportionate amount of money found with people who did not create value or work for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that civilization exists today (in contrast to being blown up) because, in every group of people, there are individuals who are willing to spend time and energy towards causes that are beyond themselves without expecting a reward. People are willing to compromise to maintain peace, are willing to teach others for free, willing to help the poor, willing to help the elderly, and so on. Money is not the center or the value of exchange for so many transactions. Some &amp;lsquo;mission&amp;rsquo; is. Open source software has probably added more value and raised awareness and knowledge to the average citizen on earth than proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was interesting to know that psychologists have studied this and that there are case studies and numerous examples of human behavior towards money. Also, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have to be conscious. One&amp;rsquo;s attitude towards money and thereby to other human beings could be shaped by the place and society or upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if so much of what we do is influenced by our upbringing and by priming (from things that we see daily, say social media), it is even more important that critical thinking becomes the most important skill that needs to be taught to everyone. Use System 2. Being a person who reacts to other people&amp;rsquo;s suggestions more often than not, the message of &amp;ldquo;Use System 2&amp;rdquo; is more of an advice and admonition to me than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the passage from the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quote&#34;&gt;Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reminders of money produce some troubling effects. Participants in one experiment were shown a list of five words from which they were required to construct a four-word phrase that had a money theme (&amp;ldquo;high a salary desk paying&amp;rdquo; became &amp;ldquo;a high-paying salary&amp;rdquo;). Other primes&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were much more subtle, including the presence of an irrelevant money-related object in the background, such as a stack of Monopoly money on a table, or a computer with a screen saver of dollar bills floating in water.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money-primed people become more independent than they would be without the associative trigger. They persevered almost twice as long in trying to solve a very difficult problem before they asked the experimenter for help, a crisp demonstration of increased self-reliance. Money-primed people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time helping another student who pretended to be confused about an experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on their mind picked up fewer pencils. In another experiment in the series, participants were told that they would shortly have a get-acquainted conversation with another person and were asked to set up two chairs while the experimenter left to retrieve that person. Participants primed by money chose to stay much farther apart than their nonprimed peers (118 vs. 80 centimeters). Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. &amp;hellip; living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Engineering Manager Interviews</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-23-engineering-manager-interviews/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-23-engineering-manager-interviews/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-23-engineering-manager-interviews/ -&lt;p&gt;A couple of folks asked me recently my opinion on how to do well in an Engineering Manager interview or what should they do to be more successful. I provided some inputs based on my experience of interviewing and hiring eng managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also thought I&amp;rsquo;d write down notes as a way to help others who might find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-may-not-be-you&#34;&gt;It may not be you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that I emphasized was that though there may be many things that they could improve to do well in interviews, most of the time, it is not them. The employer may just have had too many candidates who are very good fits for the position and might even have used &amp;lsquo;Optimal Stopping&amp;rsquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So, one should keep trying. The key thing to look out would be to not have the same approach everywhere since every company, and teams within these companies are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-general-structure&#34;&gt;The General Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure is different in different companies. Some companies don&amp;rsquo;t hire for specific teams but for the company as a whole. In my past experience, I have done things in different ways, but mostly hired for specific teams, at least for specific orgs. It makes it easier for the recruiter to pitch to a candidate, IMHO. I generally give a paragraph to the recruiter and also explain what the job responsibilities are. As a hiring manager, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt that I should talk to the person after the recruiter clears him/her. Ask a couple of situational questions and make time available to answer any questions. I feel like either the hiring manager or someone in leadership should talk to a person before bringing the person onsite. The time of the team is premium and should not be wasted in an onsite interview if there is a chance that the person may not work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The onsite interview itself could be varied. I would recommended doing at least 1 coding interview, 1 system design interview, 1 process/tools interview and a few (may be 3) behavioral/leadership interviews. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to interview during telephone screen, I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure I&amp;rsquo;m one of the onsite interviewers. I&amp;rsquo;ll also make sure to include my manager or someone at the Sr. Dir or VP level and one of my peers if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as I write this, I realize that it may not be scalable for big companies who might be looking for one size fits all or a consistent approach across the company. I&amp;rsquo;m visualizing a startup or a small company where every hire matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarizing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telephone/Remote&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recruiter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telephone Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring Manager Interview (could be same as 1b)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onsite/Video&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System Design Interview (2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership Interview (3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-overarching-goal&#34;&gt;The Overarching goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the overarching goal for companies who are trying to hire a manager (including promoting within) is to see if they can find someone who would be effective in a &lt;strong&gt;continuous problem solving environment&lt;/strong&gt;, someone who is brave to face challenges and mature enough to accept responsibilities. As Brene Brown says &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;I want to live in a world with braver, bolder leaders&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Here is a quote from &amp;ldquo;Daring Greatly&amp;rdquo; talking about the experience of leading -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I think about my personal experiences with leading over the past few years, the only endeavors that have required the same level of self-awareness and equally high-level “comms plans” are being married for twenty-four years and parenting. And that’s saying something. I completely underestimated the pull on my emotional bandwidth, the sheer determination it takes to stay calm under pressure, and the weight of continuous problem solving and decision making. Oh, yeah—and the sleepless nights.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different companies may follow different strategies to achieve this. A company like Amazon might give guidelines to ask questions to evaluate people based on its 14 leadership principles &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some may have similar frameworks or some may not. But the desire is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous &amp;lsquo;problem&amp;rsquo; solving! What are the problems? They could be anything. The &amp;lsquo;problems&amp;rsquo; could be related to a production incident that needs to be handled asap, a design decision to give inputs on which path is better to meet the objectives, asked to take up a project without clear or any requirements, performance issues of the system, people related issues, setting up of goals and vision for the team that is overdue, status reports to upper management, and so on. How to deal with multiple things by prioritizing the right things at the right time is the key to being effective. Of course, there are frameworks in place in most successful companies to make sure that employees are as effective as possible. But having a dialogue is a good way to gauge a person&amp;rsquo;s experience and ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interview-questions&#34;&gt;Interview Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, coming to the questions. There is lot of material on coding questions (say Cracking the Coding Interview or hackerrank or leetcode) and System design (lot of videos on Youtube). As far as I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, people generally tend to do well in coding questions, moderately in system design and not so well in the leadership questions. The general thinking is, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about my life, so what is there to prepare?&amp;rdquo; So they end up giving examples for scenarios which just pop up in their mind, mostly just focusing on the immediate past projects or talking in generic terms instead of giving concrete technologies or situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a hiring manager&amp;rsquo;s perspective, though many people say that one should go into an interview with a mindset of no-hire and then be convinced otherwise, I have always done the opposite. I interview folks who I&amp;rsquo;m impressed by their resume/project work or references and go into the interview by saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to hire this person unless he/she gives me a reason not to.&amp;rdquo; So, it makes all the more sense to visualize the interview at home, convince yourself that you can convince the other person and go into the interview confidently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d categorize the questions in these 5 buckets to understand different facets of the person&amp;rsquo;s ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Why are you interested in this job?&amp;quot;. There are many variants of this and the main objective is to find out - What makes the person qualified for the job? Why did the person get into management? How big of a team is the person comfortable managing? What kind of challenges does the person like, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiring&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;What do you look for when you hire someone?&amp;quot;. The discussion around this area would be to find out - Does the person have experience in hiring? Does the person hire for a fit or to raise the bar? How does the person rate candidates? How does the person convince someone to join their team, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Skill&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Tell me of a time when you recommended a technology but did not get accepted?&amp;quot;. The discussions around this would be the find out - Is the person abreast with technology that we&amp;rsquo;re using? Does the person have a good handle on technologies that they&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in their resume? Can the person agree/disagree logically with architects and tech leads, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Management&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a low performer&amp;rdquo;. The question or related question will try to find out how the person does performance management. Has the person turned around a low performer?, has the person reward a high achiever? has the person laid off anyone? etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict Resolution&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Tell me about a time when two groups/individuals in your team had a conflict and you were called to mediate&amp;rdquo;. In a fast paced environment, conflict is unavoidable. Sometimes within team members but many times with other team members who may have different KPIs/OKRs, or with other groups like PMs/PgMs or Architects. Has the person been in situations to resolve conflicts? Has the person done prioritization exercises on competing goals, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally would ask a question on process, especially around CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) since I think that makes a huge difference in building and maintaining highly scalable software systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding materials to read, I would suggest &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897/&#34;&gt;The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Path&lt;/a&gt; or other books mentioned in my article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-03-reading-list-leadership/&#34;&gt;Leadership - Essential Books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-interview&#34;&gt;After the interview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is for the interviewer rather than the interviewee. I think, taking notes is very important since it may so happen that multiple candidates are excellent and the panel might have to decide on just one person. In that case, it might be better to refer the good ones to a different team, hopefully without another round of interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the general practice in most companies is to tell the candidate that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t be selected and they can re-apply only after a year. That is totally unfair if the candidate actually did really well in the interview but preference was given to another person because that person was extraordinary in some unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If none of the candidates do well after a series of onsite interviews, that is a red flag. It indicates an ineffective system where something in the pipeline is not proper. There may be a divergence between criteria used by recruiter vs telephone interviewer vs the onsite team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies give an option to the candidate to do reverse interviews. Once the candidate is cleared, he/she could interview teams within the company and choose which team to join. That is such a noble and lofty thing to do. I wish more companies embrace that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Migrating to a new theme</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-22-migrating-to-new-theme/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-22-migrating-to-new-theme/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-22-migrating-to-new-theme/ -&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of migrating the site to a new theme which had a better font than I had. Also wanted a smaller font to cover lot of text in a smaller area. Stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/paperesque/&#34;&gt;paperesque&lt;/a&gt; theme on hugo themes site. It was a simple theme with lot more focus on writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, spent some time migrating to the new theme. It is cloudy outside due to the forest fires on Mount Diablo. It seems like winter and somehow looking out of the window and seeing an overcast sky seems to be the perfect weather to write/read or do this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;trials-before-the-migration&#34;&gt;Trials before the migration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the actual migration, I thought I will try out a few themes to see if something else appealed. Tried the following - bilberry, kube, loveit, mediumish, zzo. Created a new site for each (which is as easy as &lt;code&gt;hugo new site abc&lt;/code&gt;) and added the theme there. Then copied over some of my articles to see if it worked. Some of them did, some of them didn&amp;rsquo;t, some of them didn&amp;rsquo;t look the way I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about migration of any software is that one always enters into it with optimism, thinking that it is going to be simple, just a few minutes of work of swapping one thing for another. That&amp;rsquo;s probably why most migration projects run over budget. Many times new things are discovered only after one starts the work. But it is fun, challenging and engaging work. While doing it, one might feel like it is a time sucker and want to give up but if you keep at it, the end results are quite satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;migration-to-paperesque&#34;&gt;Migration to paperesque&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few issues that I had to fix were the following. There was a JS error during build that I temporarily fixed by removing it from head_includes.html. There were a few shortcodes that I had created in the aurora theme that I had to bring over. Spent some time figuring out how to change the home page. Tried to use the old style of two columns with a lot of links. Then decided against it. Wanted to put that content into about.md. Was wondering how to do that and then realized that the easiest way to embed HTML into markdown file is to create a shortcode. Shortcode is a super-power in hugo. One can do a lot of wonders using that. Also, spent time figuring out how to add social media buttons on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_social_media_buttons2&#34;&gt;W3 schools&lt;/a&gt; has the easiest example to embed social media buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;next-day-edits---new-migration-to-even&#34;&gt;Next day edits - New migration to Even&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having the site set up with this theme, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite happy. The original intent was to move to a theme which put the blog posts in the front. This one still had the earlier issue of a user having to navigate to the actual post by clicking twice. So migrated to another theme that I had tried in the past. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to do much for this. It had a bigger feature set than what I wanted though it didn&amp;rsquo;t have the beauty of paperesque. One thing that attracted me to theme &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even&#34;&gt;Even&lt;/a&gt; was the Table of contents on the right side with highlights of the section that I was reading. So spent some more time migrating to the newer theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;edits-after-a-week---new-migration-to-diary&#34;&gt;Edits after a week - New migration to Diary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I looked at the site, I thought the older theme was probably better. Still think that a left nav with some static details, central body with text and a right have with dynamic toc is better. At least for desktop viewing. The theme &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robinsonraju/hugo-theme-diary&#34;&gt;Diary&lt;/a&gt; gave these. Though it doesnt have social media icons, I thought it was cleaner and better. I could add the social media icons later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some screenshots of &amp;lsquo;the before and after&amp;rsquo; of the current migrations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Writing Habit</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-08-the-writing-habit/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-08-the-writing-habit/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-08-08-the-writing-habit/ -&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I wanted to do this year was to focus a bit more on writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve had times when I wrote in bursts, and I always told myself - Yeah, this is great. I should do more of it. It is not like I feel like a Yoda who knows too much and needs to write down to teach others, in fact, it is just the opposite. I&amp;rsquo;m always pulled in multiple directions to learn different things since there is so much to learn. The act of writing itself brings some kind of joy that is fulfilling to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some short periods of writing that I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000s
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, I wrote a lot of code during this time, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During my initial days as software developer, I used to write on the side, not software or technical stuff but just random things that I wanted to be made as stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started blogging using ger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started writing poetry, even made a book of poetry with my wife.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2010s
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I took up CS 200, the professor wanted us to write an article every week. That topic of focus at that time was Project Management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I took up CS 297, the professor wanted us to write an article or prepare a ppt for the set of research papers we read that past week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing MS CS at SJSU was probably the best learning experience I had. Got opportunities to solidify a lot of concepts, comprehend technical material better, and write technical papers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing (or anything for that matter) is easier when you&amp;rsquo;re doing it for someone. When someone is expecting an output from you, it is easy to sit down and meet the deadline. But there is more satisfaction in doing things that no one asked for, in doing things that you asked yourself. Makes you feel in control and not being controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I committed to writing at least for 30 minutes per day. Regardless of whether it was good or not, the purpose was to build the habit. I was able to write long notes like &lt;a href=&#34;books/2020-07-10-the-return-of-the-native/&#34;&gt;The Return of the Native&lt;/a&gt; which is over 7000 words by just writing a bit each day as a I read. Was trying hard to follow the Seinfeld method&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and not break the chain. Luckily, github shows the chain beautifully and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to buy a calendar like what Seinfeld had suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing or reading is the hardest when you have a long list of things to be done and when you feel the need to have more than 24 hours in a day just to keep up with the unending list. It is easy to give advice to someone and tell them to prioritize when they are actually caught in a quicksand that is pulling them down. So, one actually needs to be fortunate to be a able set even 10 minutes towards something that one wants to do. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to have gotten the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626&#34;&gt;Jerry Seinfeld&amp;rsquo;s Productivity Secret&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld revealed a unique calendar system he uses to pressure himself to write every day. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works. He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker. He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. &amp;ldquo;After a few days you&amp;rsquo;ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You&amp;rsquo;ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t break the chain,&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; he said again for emphasis.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-25-great-expectations/ -&lt;h1 id=&#34;thoughts&#34;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/#primary-school&#34;&gt;My Reading Journey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The Great Expectations&lt;/strong&gt; was one of the first novels I read. I&amp;rsquo;ve read it so many times over the years, each time taking something away more than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m reading it after &lt;strong&gt;The Return of the Native&lt;/strong&gt; and can&amp;rsquo;t help but compare the approaches of Hardy and Dickens. Both give us a glimpse of a period of time and a set of people that we become intimate with by reading. Through great dialogues, monologues, many times in the dialect of the locals, the readers get to know the emotional state of the protagonists at every juncture of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this novel, we feel like Pip is narrating as he is living his life and not as a person who is recounting events from his past. The fear he feels with the convict, when he is harassed by the guests, when soldiers come to the door and he thinks they have come for him, his feelings for Estella, his feeling of hopelessness of being a blacksmith, and so on, everything is so well captured, that it is unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there is an element of fate interfering withe lives of people in both the novels, I think fate is much more harsher in Hardy&amp;rsquo;s novel than in Dickens. I think the overarching narrative is that people &amp;lsquo;reap what they sow&amp;rsquo; and usually get into difficult situations or fortunate ones depending on many of the decisions they make. Matthew Pocket, Herbert, Joe, Biddy are good throughout and they get rewarded in the end. Compeyson, Orlick, Pumblechook, Drummle, are not and they get punished. But, when I think of &amp;lsquo;The Return of the Native&amp;rsquo;, I think the narrative is that people don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice. They are just playthings in fate&amp;rsquo;s hands. Things will play out the way it needs to regardless of what people plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stage-i&#34;&gt;Stage I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-i---pip-meets-the-convict&#34;&gt;Chapter I - Pip meets the convict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel starts with Pip, a boy standing near the graves of his parents and his dead brothers trying to imagine what they looked like. We get to know that he had named himself and Pip in his childhood and his actual name is Philip Pirip. He is brought up &amp;lsquo;by hand&amp;rsquo; by his sister and brother in law. Brother in law, Joe Gargery, is a blacksmith.
Pip is interrupted by a large, dirty man with prison irons attached to his leg. He demands to know Pip&amp;rsquo;s name, turns him upside down to empty his pockets, He tells Pip to bring him some food and a file after he gets to know that his uncle is a blacksmith. He tells him that there is a young man with him who will tear is heart and liver out if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t oblige. Pip runs home frightened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-ii---pip-steals-food-for-the-convict&#34;&gt;Chapter II - Pip steals food for the convict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip returns to his home. His sister, who is 20 years senior to him, scolds him and asks him where he has been. She reminds him that she brought him up by hand and that he is a burden to her. Her husband, Joe is a mild-mannered person. Mrs. Joe gives Pip and Joe bread and butter fo supper. Pip hides his in his trousers. Joe is surprised that Pip bolted the bread and Mrs. Joe is upset that he swallowed the whole thing. She gives him tar-water as punishment.
They discuss about the escaped convicts when they hear gunshots. They live near the coast, near the marshland, where ships that form as jails are docked.
Next morning is Christmas day. Pip is not able to sleep in the night and early in the morning, he gets up, takes some more food from the pantry, some brandy and runs off to the marshes in search of the convict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-iii---pip-gives-food-to-the-convict&#34;&gt;Chapter III - Pip gives food to the convict&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his way, he sees man that he thinks is the convict, touches him and gets startled to know that the person is not the person as before. He thinks this is the young man the other man was talking about. The person runs away. Pip walks a bit more and finds the original convict and gives him food and the file. When Pip tells him about the other convict, this man is totally surprised. He gets to file away at the irons on his leg and ignores Pip. Pip slips away and runs towards home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-iv---christmas-dinner&#34;&gt;Chapter IV - Christmas Dinner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip rushes home thinking that his theft might have been found out. But is relieved to know that everyone is busy in dinner preparations for Christmas. They have some guests - Uncle Pumblechook (Joe&amp;rsquo;s uncle), Mr. Wopsle (church clerk who has a voice better than the priest) and Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. During dinner Mrs. Joe and Uncle Pumblechook focus on Pip and tell him that he has to be grateful towards his sister. Joe tries to console Pip by pouring some gravy into his plate. Mr. Pumblechook drinks the brandy from the bottle and spits it out discovering that it was tar-water. Pip is frightened thinking that his stealth will get discovered. He is about to run out of the home, opens the door and sees cops outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-v---pip-and-joe-joins-soldiers-to-search-for-convicts&#34;&gt;Chapter V - Pip and Joe joins soldiers to search for convicts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip is relieved when the soldiers say that they need the services of a blacksmith. So they did not arrive to catch him! The soldiers need help to repair handcuffs. Joe helps with it after that, when they set out to find the fugitives, Joe, Mr. Wopsle and pip join them. After a long search they find them. The two men are found fighting each other in a ditch. The convict tells the soldiers that he was capturing the other convict to bring him to the prison. The soldiers capture both men and take them to the station. Pip wonders if the convict would think that he led the soldiers to them. The convict tells the soldiers that he had stolen some food and file from the blacksmith&amp;rsquo;s home, thus clearing Pip&amp;rsquo;s name. Joe says it is ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-vi---pip-and-joe-get-back-home&#34;&gt;Chapter VI - Pip and Joe get back home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip and Joe get back and tell the folks what happened. Everyone wonders how the thief broke in and have multiple theories including him entering through the chimney. Pip does&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, not even Joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-vii---pip-gets-the-opportunity-to-offer-services-a-rich-lady&#34;&gt;Chapter VII - Pip gets the opportunity to offer services a rich lady&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip is not old enough to be apprenticed to Joe. So, he attends a school run by Mr. Wopsle&amp;rsquo;s great aunt. Mr. Wopsle is a tenant of one of the rooms in the building. The building also has a little general shop. The grand-aunt is helped by Biddy who is her grand-daughter. Pip comes home and tries to teach Joe what he has learnt. Joe is super impressed. When asked why Joe didn&amp;rsquo;t go to school, he talks about his childhood when his dad was a drunkard who beat up him and his mother. Since his mother was abused, he is very careful to note that he would never abuse his wife and is ok to take abuse from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Joe makes occasional trips with Mr. Pumblechook on market days to assist him to buy household items since he was a bachelor and didn&amp;rsquo;t trust his servants. One of the days she returns with Mr. Pumblechook to inform Joe and Pip that a rich old lady, Ms. Havisham has asked for a boy and Mr. Pumblechook was gracious enough to suggest Pip. She is very happy and grateful to Mr. Pumblechook for the opportunity. Gets Pip cleaned up for the visit and leaves that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-viii---pip-visits-satis-house&#34;&gt;Chapter VIII - Pip visits Satis House&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip stays with Mr. Pumblechook that night and is taken to Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s mansion the next day. Pumblechook reminds him to be grateful for the opportunity to go into this great house. Though the house is big, it seems very old and not maintained. A gruff young lady greets them, lets only Pip in. While walking she mentions that the name of the house is Manor House or Satis House. She leaves him in a room which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have outside light coming in but has candles. Pip sees Ms. Havisham dressed in bridal clothes. They look grand but are old and yellow. She asks him to play and he is confused. She then asks him to call Estella. He calls her and they play cards. Estella beats him at the game and insults him for his looks and clothes throughout. He almost cries in front of Estella on the way back but holds back his tears. Pip is so embarrassed by himself that he kicks against a wall on the way back. He realizes that he is a low-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-ix---pip-describes-events-at-satis-house&#34;&gt;Chapter IX - Pip describes events at Satis house&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip returns home to find everyone very curious to know what happened. Mr. Pumblechook says that he has never seen Ms. Havisham but has had interactions with the house many times on business. Pip is uncomfortable since he is still sad about him being low in the social strata. He invents a story about Ms. Havisham sitting on a black velvet coach, Estella handing her cake and wine on a gold plate, and four large dogs fighting for veal cutlets from a silver basket. They are totally astonished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Pip tells Joe the truth and he admonishes Pip to not tell lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-x---pip-gets-money-from-the-convict-from-the-past&#34;&gt;Chapter X - Pip gets money from the convict from the past&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple of days later Pip wakes up thinking - best step he could take towards making himself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew. So he goes over and learns from Biddy who is willing to help him with all that she knows. 
One day, his sister tells Pip to get Joe from a public house named Three Jolly Bargemen on his way back from school, since he goes there in the evenings to smoke. Pip goes there and a man offers them a drink. Joe refuses but the man insists. Pip notices that the man is stirring his drink with the file that Pip had stolen in the past. He gets a fright thinking that his secret would be out. The man gives Pip a shilling wrapped in paper which turns out to be pound notes. Joe goes back thinking it was a mistake but are not able to find the man. Pip has a nightmare about the file in his sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xi---pip-goes-to-ms-havishams-again&#34;&gt;Chapter XI - Pip goes to Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last meeting, Ms Havisham had told him to come after 6 days. The day comes and Pip makes a visit to the Manor House. Estella lets him in and takes him to a room where he sees some other people - 3 ladies and a man. A lady named Camilla, who reminded Pip of his sister, a man named Cousin Raymond, another lady named Sarah Pocket, another lady named Georgiana. They look at him and comment about him. He is then taken to another room where there is a wedding cake that is rotten and has insects crawling about them. Ms. Havisham holds Pip&amp;rsquo;s hand and goes around in the room. She says that when she dies, her body will be on the table with all the people watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip plays cards with Estella with Ms. Havisham watching. Estella continues to insult him. On his way back, a thin boy approaches him and challenges him for a fight. Pip knocks him down but he always gets up to fight. Finally he gives up. Estella who is waiting at the gate doesn&amp;rsquo;t ask him why he is late. She grants him a kiss. He kisses her but still feels like a downtrodden person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xii---pips-appointment-at-ms-havishams-becomes-daily&#34;&gt;Chapter XII - Pip&amp;rsquo;s appointment at Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s becomes daily&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time when he goes over to the Manor House, Pip is half expecting to be punished or scolded for beating up the thin boy. But he doesn&amp;rsquo;t find the boy anywhere nor is there any mention of him. He goes in and continues the regular thing of walking with Ms. Havisham in the room and playing with Estella. Sometimes the walk goes on for 3 hours. Ms. Havisham gets to know more about Pip, that he is set to be apprenticed to Joe when he grows older, etc. Pip is expected to go daily and that continues for many months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, Ms. Havisham says Pip is old enough to be apprenticed and asks him to call Joe to the Manor House. He gets home and tells the news to Joe and Mrs. Joe. His sister is angry that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t invited and takes it out on Joe and Pip. She asks Joe why he didn&amp;rsquo;t marry a slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xiii---pips-apprenticeship-to-joe-is-formalized&#34;&gt;Chapter XIII - Pip&amp;rsquo;s apprenticeship to Joe is formalized&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, Pip, Joe and his sister go over to the town. His sister goes to Mr. Pumblechook&amp;rsquo;s place and Pip and Joe head over to Satis House. Estella opens the gate as usual, doesn&amp;rsquo;t take any notice of them and leads them to Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s room. Ms. Havisham asks a few questions to them. Joe answers questions to Pip instead of to Ms. Havisham even for questions directed at him. It embarrasses Pip. Towards the end, Ms. Havisham gives a generous amount of 25 guineas and tells him to give it to his master, Joe.
They get back and tell Mrs. Joe and Mr. Pumblechook and they are very surprised at the amount given. As he goes back home, Pip realizes that the job that he once looked forward to, is not exciting anymore. He does not want to be a blacksmith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xiv---pip-feels-bad-about-being-just-a-blacksmith&#34;&gt;Chapter XIV - Pip feels bad about being just a blacksmith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip says that it is a miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. He once felt distinguished and happy merely at the thought of becoming Joe&amp;rsquo;s apprentice but not anymore. As he thinks back, he reminds himself of all the great qualities of Joe. The reason he did not run away or feel out of place, was not because he was virtuous, or faithful, it was because Joe was virtuous, Joe was faithful beyond measure.
Pip is haunted by the fear that Estella would come one day and see him with a black face and hands, dirtied by the job and consider him lower than she already thought and truly despise him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xv---mrs-joe-is-attacked&#34;&gt;Chapter XV - Mrs. Joe is attacked&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip continues to work for Joe. Since he has grown, his education at Mr. Wopsle&amp;rsquo;s great-aunt&amp;rsquo;s school is done. Biddy continues to teach him what she knows, Pip tries to learn things from Mr. Wopsle also. He tries to teach Joe what he knows it is not of much use.
One day, he asks Joe for half-day off to go to town and see Estella. Joe advises him against it telling him that Ms. Havisham might think that he has gone there to ask for something. Pip is insistent and Joe grants him his wish. Orlick, another chap who works with Joe also asks for half-day telling him that he should treat all employees equally. Joe relents. Mrs. Joe hears this and is totally furious. She asks Joe if he thinks he is so rich that he can afford to waste wages. Quarrel ensues between her and Orlick. Joe beats him up for talking bad to his wife.
Sunday comes and Pip goes to Satis House. Estella doesn&amp;rsquo;t open the gate, it is Sarah Pocket. Ms. Havisham tells him that Estella has gone away abroad to be educated to become a lady and is prettier than ever, hoping to taunt him.
Pip is in no mood to go home. But goes over slowly. On the way he hears some commotion, someone says there is something wrong at his place. He reaches home to find that someone has broken in and knocked down Mrs. Joe with a very hard blow on her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xvi---mrs-joe-is-paralyzed-biddy-comes-to-stay-to-take-care-of-her&#34;&gt;Chapter XVI - Mrs. Joe is paralyzed, Biddy comes to stay to take care of her&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They discover that the blow was made with the leg-iron that the convict had filed away long back. Mrs. Joe is completely bedridden and Joe and Pip take care of her with difficulty. Mrs. Joe cannot talk and does not know to write.
Lucky for them, Mr. Wopsle&amp;rsquo;s great-aunt passes away and Biddy comes to stay with them. She nurses Mrs. Joe and takes care of others.
Mrs. Joe often used to write the symbol of T which Joe or Pip never understood. Biddy surmises that it could mean a hammer. They realize that Mrs. Joe means to say Orlick. They bring in Orlick thinking that she will denounce him as the person who hit her but she is friendly with him and he comes by often after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xvii---pip-confides-in-biddy-of-his-desire-to-become-a-gentleman&#34;&gt;Chapter XVII - Pip confides in Biddy of his desire to become a gentleman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip goes to Satis Manor on his birthday to visit Ms. Havisham. She gives him a guinea and tells him to come next yr during his birthday. Pip becomes conscious of Biddy changing into a neat young lady, though not as beautiful as Estella. He asks Biddy how she manages to take care of the house and also catch up with him on all the reading and learning. She reminds him jokingly that she is his first teacher. Pip has heartfelt conversations with Biddy on how he feels. He tells her that he wishes he could be happy as a blacksmith and be with Joe and her but he is not, he wants to be a gentleman. When he tells her than it is on account of a young lady at Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s, Biddy asks if he wants to be a gentleman to spite her or to win her. She gives the sage advice that both reasons are not good enough and that the lady is not worth winning over. Pip tells her frankly that it would have been easier if he was in love with her than with Estella. Biddy doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind it and is thankful for his confidence. On the way back home, they meet Orlick and both hate to be with him. She says he has eyes on her and that&amp;rsquo;s why she doesn&amp;rsquo;t like him, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be of Pip&amp;rsquo;s concern. They get home. Pip&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with life keep growing and he says that the confusion is fifty thousand fold and is scattering his wits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most poignant part of the story yet. One feels sad for Pip, sad for Biddy, and sad for being in a place of unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?&amp;rdquo; Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; I moodily answered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because if it is to spite her,&amp;rdquo; Biddy pursued, &amp;ldquo;I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xviii---an-anonymous-patron-bestows-wealth-on-pip&#34;&gt;Chapter XVIII - An anonymous patron bestows wealth on Pip&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the fourth year of his apprenticeship with Joe and on one Saturday evening, while they were in Three Jolly Bargemen, a lawyer presents himself and asks for Pip. Pip and Joe go with him to Joe&amp;rsquo;s home, and Mr. Jaggers, the lawyer tells them that an anonymous patron wants to gift a property to Pip and fund his training to become a gentleman. At the beginning, Mr. Jaggers asks Joe if he wants money or some form of compensation for relieving Pip from his apprenticeship. Joe says no. Mr. Jaggers tells them that Pip will live in London and he can take training from anyone. Since he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know anyone, Jaggers suggests Mr. Mathew Pocket whom he has heard of. Pip quickly makes the connection to Ms. Havisham since he had heard the name there. Jaggers gives him money to buy clothes. Joe is dumbfounded. Jaggers again asks if Joe needs any money for the loss of Pip&amp;rsquo;s services and he says no. When Jaggers insists, Joe gets upset. Jaggers leaves. Pip decides that he will buy clothes but not wear them from the village, lest everyone see. He will wear them from Pumblechook&amp;rsquo;s home and go to London. Pip tells Biddy and she is happy with the news. Though Joe and Biddy are cheerful, Pip is gloomy at the prospect of leaving. But he is also looking forward to leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xix---pip-prepares-to-leave-his-village&#34;&gt;Chapter XIX - Pip prepares to leave his village&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip prepares to leave to town to shop for clothes. He mentions to Joe that if he could read or &amp;lsquo;get on a little more&amp;rsquo; with the lessons, he could have come with him to London. Joe mentions that he is awfully dull and it is better for him here. Pip mentions the same to Biddy and she tells him that Joe might actually like it here in the village than in London. Pip thinks it is because of her jealousy. Biddy says he can think what he wants to. Pip goes over to the town. Pumblechook is totally a changed man to him now. He ingratiates himself to Pip by giving him the best food, shaking his hands many times and praises him often. Pip gets his new clothes and dresses himself up in those and goes over to Satis House. Sarah Pocket receives him at the gate and he gets to meet Ms. Havisham who already knows about his good fortune from Mr. Jaggers. Pip goes back to Pumblechook&amp;rsquo;s place, changes clothes and goes to his village. His packs up and bids good bye to Joe and Biddy, who bid him a tearful good-bye. When he reaches the finger-post at the end of the village, he is also overcome with emotion and sheds a tear. He goes on, towards town, taking a coach, changing coaches along the way and onward to London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stage-ii&#34;&gt;Stage II&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xx---pip-reaches-london&#34;&gt;Chapter XX - Pip reaches London&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip gets to London. He is scared by the immensity of London and does not like the ugly, crooked, narrow and dirty roads. He goes to Mr. Jaggers&amp;rsquo;s office and finds out that he is in the court. He is asked to wait in the room. There are many others waiting for Jaggers. When Jaggers comes in he sees how others are scared of him. Jaggers tells him that he is to ramain with Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s son at Barnard&amp;rsquo;s Inn, until Monday and then go to Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s home. He was given generous allowance and cards of many tradesmen from whom he could make purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxi---pip-meets-mr-pockets-son&#34;&gt;Chapter XXI - Pip meets Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s son&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers&amp;rsquo; assistant, takes Pip over to Barnard&amp;rsquo;s Inn and Pip is not very impressed by the Inn from outside. Pip views it as an imperfect realization of one of his first great expectations. When they reach the room, they don&amp;rsquo;t find young Mr. Pocket there. Instead they find a note that says &amp;lsquo;Gone out, back shortly&amp;rsquo;. Wemmick goes away and Pip waits for the young man to come. He takes a bit of time but eventually comes. He says that he had gone out to the market to get some fruits for Pip. When they get to see each other, Pip realizes that the young boy is the same &amp;lsquo;pale young gentleman&amp;rsquo; that he had beaten up at Satis House, for which he got a kiss from Estella! Both are surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxii---herbert-tells-pip-ms-havishams-sad-story&#34;&gt;Chapter XXII - Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s sad story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip finds that Herbert, Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s son, is a very amiable person. He tells him that Estella was adopted by Ms. Havisham and that he didn&amp;rsquo;t care much for being betrothed to her. During dinner, Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s story. While eating, he also teaches Pip upper class manners whenever a chance comes. He gives Pip the name of Handel, after a famous composer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote about Pip&amp;rsquo;s impression of Herbert, caught my eye -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, &lt;strong&gt;a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean&lt;/strong&gt;. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would &lt;strong&gt;never be very successful or rich&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped reading the book and thought about myself at that moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s Story - Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s father was a country gentleman and also a brewer. After her mother died when she was young, her father denied her nothing and in his doting, he made her a spoit child. Her father married a servant in secret and had another child, Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s half brother. As the son grew, he turned out to be a rogue. The father disinherited him and he was out to take revenge. Ms. Havisham falls in love with a showy man who pretends to be a gentleman. But he stands her up during her wedding. It turns out that the man was friends with the half-brother and this was an act of revenge. Ms. Havisham is devastated. Time stops and she has been in her wedding dress with all the arrangements including the cake not being touched or removed after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbert says that he works in a counting house who is planning to get into trading in the future. Pip makes a visit to Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s house after a few days. He finds Mrs. Pocket sitting at a place and reading not bothering about her children. Two maid servants take care of the kids. Mr. Pocket is a good man but is overwhelmed by having so many kids (7 kids).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxiii---pip-meets-mr-mathew-pocket&#34;&gt;Chapter XXIII - Pip meets Mr. Mathew Pocket&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pocket is happy to see Pip and hopes that Pip also finds it good to be tutored by him.
Mrs. Pocket is the daughter of a knight and was brought up as a lady so that she could be an ornamental wife to a man of title. She ends up marrying Mr. Pocket against her dad&amp;rsquo;s wishes. She is unable to manage her household which is run by the servants. She resents being an incapable person and laments her fall from being nobility.
Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and Cambridge and had distinguished himself, but he ruined his prospects by marrying early and to the wrong person. He had to take up tutoring to maintain his family. He is sad about his lost chances and tries to get a break as a favor from one of the parents of the youth he tutors. Though they promise him something, after the education is done, they forget.
Ms. Coiler, a snoopy neighbor, tries to get close to Pip and tells him that Mrs. Pocket thinks it is humiliating that her husband has to tutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxiv---pip-sees-how-jaggers-commands-respect&#34;&gt;Chapter XXIV - Pip sees how Jaggers commands respect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip takes a long walk with Mr. Pocket and gets advice on how to improve. He like Mr. Pocket.
He travels to and fro between his apartment at St. Barnard which he shares with Herbert and Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s home.
He goes to Jaggers and requests for money to buy furniture and Jaggers is generous and asks his clerk Wemmick to write a check. Wemmick introduces him to other clerks and also gives him a glimpse of what type of personality Jaggers is. He tells him about the two masks on Jaggers desk, that they were of two famous clients. He takes Pip to court to see Jaggers in action and Pip is very impressed at the respect and fear that Jaggers commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxv---pip-visits-wemmicks-castle&#34;&gt;Chapter XXV - Pip visits Wemmick&amp;rsquo;s Castle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other students of Mr. Pocket are introduced. Bentley Drummle is a rich spoilt kid who is a blockhead. Startop is a kid who is spoilt by over affection from his mother.
After a couple of months, Mr. Pocket is visited by the relatives of Ms. Havisham that Pip had met in the past. They are Mr and Mrs. Camilla and Georgiana. Camilla is Mr.Pocket&amp;rsquo;s sister. Georgiana is a cousin. They don&amp;rsquo;t have much regard for Mr.Pocket though.
Pip decides to visit Wemmick since he had invited him home. They walk to the home and get talking. Wemmick tells Pip that Jaggers never locks his door and challenges anyone to rob him.
Pip reaches the home and finds it to be a fancy one. Wemmick calls it &amp;lsquo;The Castle&amp;rsquo;. He designed, architected and built the home. It even has a drawbridge and canon (named Stinger). He has an elderly father who he calls &amp;lsquo;The Aged&amp;rsquo;. There is a little girl who takes care of the Aged. The dinner is excellent and Pip is very pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxvi---pip-and-friends-have-dinner-with-jaggers&#34;&gt;Chapter XXVI - Pip and friends have dinner with Jaggers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaggers invites Pip and his friends for dinner. Jaggers asks about Drummle, giving him a nickname of &amp;lsquo;The Spider&amp;rsquo;. He has an ability to read people and think what they would amount to. They have a good meal, served by the housekeeper.
When the men have an argument about strength, Jaggers makes Molly, the housekeeper to show her wrists. They look at the disfigured palms and Jaggers tells them that this is is strongest pair of wrists that he has seen.
When the conversations heat up, Jaggers dismisses them and the men go home.
A few months later, Drummle leaves Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s home and everyone seems relieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxvii---joe-visits-pip-at-barnards&#34;&gt;Chapter XXVII - Joe visits Pip at Barnard&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip gets a letter from Biddy informing him that Joe is coming to London with Mr. Wopsle and he would like to visit him and if Pip is not available, he could leave a message.
Pip is not quite looking forward to the meeting since he is embarrassed by Joe. He is relieved that Joe was coming to Barnard&amp;rsquo;s Inn and not to Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s home) since he didn&amp;rsquo;t want Drummle to meet Joe and judge Pip that he has relatives of low status.
Pip has furnished his apartment very lavishly and even has a servant whom he calls The Avenger.
Joe comes and it is evident that he is not very comfortable in the lavish settings. While they were talking Herbert comes in and is excited to see Joe and talks to him well. Joe tells them that he is in town to see Mr. Wopsle act in a play. Wopsle had left church and now was a full time actor.
After Herbert is gone, Joe tells Pip that he is actually here as a messenger. Ms. Havisham had asked to see him and that Estella was in town. She had sent a word through Pumblechook. Biddy had told Joe that it might be better to inform Pip by word than by letter.
Joe doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay for dinner and goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxviii---pip-is-on-his-way-to-visit-ms-havisham&#34;&gt;Chapter XXVIII - Pip is on his way to visit Ms. Havisham&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip decides to make a visit to Satis House. He does a lot of thinking about what to do. Should he stay at Joe&amp;rsquo;s place? Should he take the Avenger? What if Trabb&amp;rsquo;s boy tells Avenger unsavory things about his childhood? etc. He decides to stay at the Blue Boar Inn and not to take the Avenger.
Pip finds that in the coach that he takes, two convicts are also being transported. He recognizes one person as the one who gave him two one pound notes. Pip tries his best to avoid the convicts and being recognized.
The convicts don&amp;rsquo;t have a place in the back so they are put in the front much to the dismay of other passengers.
Pip overhears the convicts talking and one of them says that another person had asked him to give two one pound notes to a boy who had fed him and kept his secret. He had done it, though his companion tells him that it was a foolish thing to do hinting that he should have just taken the money. He goes on to say that the other man got charged for escaping prison and got a life sentence.
Pip gets even more alarmed after hearing the conversation thinking that he convict might recognize him soon. So as soon as the town comes, he gets down and walks the rest of the way. At the Inn, the waiter recognizes him and asks if he should send for Mr. Pumblechook. Pip says no and the waiter puts a dirty old copy of a local newspaper where Pip finds Pumblechook mentioned as the founder of Pip&amp;rsquo;s fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxix---pips-meeting-with-ms-havisham-and-the-lady-estella&#34;&gt;Chapter XXIX - Pip&amp;rsquo;s meeting with Ms. Havisham and the lady Estella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip wakes up early and goes for a walk and gets thinking, day-dreaming about Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s brilliant plans for him. He thinks that as she adopted Estella, she adopted him also and is planning to see them united. He also thinks that she has left the house is disrepair so that he could restore the house to its glory. He realizes that he loves Estella against reason, against promise, against all discouragement.
Later in the morning, he goes to Satis House and is surprised to find Orlick opening the gate. He tells that he left the forge after Pip left and joined as a porter here. Pip goes along the corridor to meet Ms. Havisham and meets Sarah Pocket on the way. He tells her that Mr. Pocket and family are well.
There is a young lady by Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s side whom Pip doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize. But when she lifts her eyes, he recognizes that it is Estella. She has returned from France and is to go to London to be introduced to society.
Later, Pip and Estella walk around the property and Estella tells Pip that she had watched Pip and Herbert fight, in secret. Pip remembers the kiss that she granted him but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
Estella tells him that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember anything in the past with emotion because she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a heart. She has never felt love.
When they get back, they learn that Mr. Jaggers will be dining with them. During dinner, Pip notices that Mr. Jaggers doesn&amp;rsquo;t give much regard to Estella. He prods Mr. Jaggers about Estella&amp;rsquo;s past and whether she is Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s daughter or not. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t get much from Jaggers.
After dinner Pip goes back to the Boar deciding to sleep there and head for London the next day, without paying a visit to Joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxx---pip-is-mocked-by-trabbs-boy&#34;&gt;Chapter XXX - Pip is mocked by Trabb&amp;rsquo;s boy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Blue Boar, Pip tells Mr. Jaggers that Orlick may not the right sort of person to work at Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s and tells him some of his past. Jaggers agrees to fire him right away. While Pip is afraid to deal with a person like Orlick, Jaggers seems to relish in that. Pip goes into town. He is proud in his gentlemanly clothes and people seem to respect him. He sees Trabb&amp;rsquo;s boy on the way and gets upset when he imitates and mocks him. As soon as he reaches London, Pip sends codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe as an apology for not visiting. In the next day&amp;rsquo;s post, he also writes a letter to Mr. Trabb saying that he will not do business with him due to the boy&amp;rsquo;s conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip confesses to Herbert about his love for Estella which Herbert had already guessed. Herbert also mentions to him that since Mr. Jaggers never mentioned Estella, marrying her may not be a condition or wish from his benefactor who he thinks is probably Ms. Havisham. He also warns him that Estella will make him miserable considering the way she has been raised. Of course, Pip doesn&amp;rsquo;t heed the advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbert also confides in Pip about him being engaged to a girl named Clara who he likes but is below his mother&amp;rsquo;s nonsensical family notions. Pip and Herbert go to see Mr. Wopsle&amp;rsquo;s play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxi---pip-and-herbert-go-to-mr-wopsles-play&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXI - Pip and Herbert go to Mr. Wopsle&amp;rsquo;s play&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The play doesn&amp;rsquo;t go well. Some actors are coughing, some have forgotten the lines, audience keep interrupting, etc. Pip and Herbert rush to go out in order to escape meeting Mr. Wopsle but they are stopped by a Jewish man who tells them that Mr. Waldengarver is expecting to see them. That turns out to be Mr. Wopsle. Pip and Herbert are polite to him and say that his acting was good. Pip invites him from supper. He is sad while going to bed and a miserable dream about this expectations being cancelled, he had to marry Herbert&amp;rsquo;s Clara or play Hamlet before thousands of people without knowing the words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxii---pip-goes-to-receive-estella-who-is-coming-to-london&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXII - Pip goes to receive Estella who is coming to London&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip receives a note from Estella via post which says that she is arriving in London by mid-day coach the day after. Pip arrives at the station 4-5 hours earlier than needed. He runs into Wemmick there who is on his way to Newgate prison to meet a client. He goes with him and is impressed by the way Wemmick is familiar with the prisoners. He gets back and fears if the the filth of the prison has rubbed off on him. Tries to dust himsself off and before long, the coach arrives with Estella in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxiii---pip-takes-estella-to-richmond&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXIII - Pip takes Estella to Richmond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estella and Pip get into a carriage to go to Richmond in Surrey which is around 10 miles. During the journey they talk and Pip&amp;rsquo;s naïveté comes across clearly when he speaks to Estella. She tells him that Ms. Havisham&amp;rsquo;s relatives write nasty letters about him, sometime anonymously to Ms. Havisham. Pip is surprised that they mean harm to him. Estella assures him that they will never succeed in their machinations against him. On the way they see Newgate prison and Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket&amp;rsquo;s place). Pip drops Estella to Richmond and then takes another carriage to get back to Hammersmith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxiv---pip-and-herbert-have-mounting-debt&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXIV - Pip and Herbert have mounting debt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip learns that he is incurring a lot of debt due to his lifestyle. Same is the case with Herbert also. They incur more debt by joining a club named &amp;lsquo;Finches of the Grove&amp;rsquo; which encourages to spend more foolishly. Drummle is part of that club.
Pip and Herbert sit down to write their debts, creating sheets with the headings - &amp;ldquo;Memorandum of Pip&amp;rsquo;s debts&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Memorandum of Herbert&amp;rsquo;s debts&amp;rdquo;. It runs to many papers and they know that their debts are mounting.
Pip receives a letter from Trabb and Co. that his sister has passed away and his attendence was requested for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxv---pip-goes-to-his-sisters-funeral&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXV - Pip goes to his sister&amp;rsquo;s funeral&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip goes to the forge and finds it to be decorated gaudily. Mr. Trabb and Co. had taken over the decorations though Joe didn&amp;rsquo;t want them saying that it would be disrespectful to Mrs. Joe.
After the ceremony, Pip has dinner with Joe and Biddy. In the night Pip asks Biddy why she didn&amp;rsquo;t write to him about his sister&amp;rsquo;s condition. She calls him Mr. Pip and tells him that he didn&amp;rsquo;t keep in touch and she didn&amp;rsquo;t think that he wanted to know. She tells him that she is going to leave the forge and be a school teacher. But will continue to look out for Joe. Pip tells her that he will visit more often and Biddy is doubtful and Pip is hurt by her distrust. When he is going away the next day, Biddy apologizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxvi---pip-comes-of-age&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXVI - Pip comes of age&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip and Herbert go from bad to worse in terms of debt. Luckily Pip turns 21 and is expecting money to come from his benefactor by at that time. He gets a note from Wemmick that Mr. Jaggers would like to meet him on that day. Thinking that he would also get to know the name of his benefactor, Pip goes over. Jaggers gives him 500 pounds and tells him that Pip will get an annual sum has to manage his money on his own now. He tells Pip that the benefactor will remain a secret.
Pip goes to Wemmick and tells him that he would like to spend the money on helping Herbert. Wemmick says his professional opinion that one should never invest portable property on a friend. He tell him that he can give his personal opinion at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxvii---wemmick-helps-pip-to-carry-out-his-generosity&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXVII - Wemmick helps Pip to carry out his generosity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip makes a visit to Wemmick&amp;rsquo;s Castle the next Sunday. He find the drawbridge drawn indicating that Wemmick is not home but he rings anyway. The Aged lets him in and says that Wemmick has gone for a walk. Wemmick comes back from the walk with Ms. Skiffins, a lady he is courting. Pip and Wemmick take a walk and Pip tells Wemmick about his desire to help Herbert without him knowing. Wemmick tells him that he can arrange things through Ms. Skiffins&amp;rsquo;s brother who is an accountant. Later, Wemmick carries out Pip&amp;rsquo;s plan. Herbert gets a call from Clarriker and Co. with an offer and he is ecstatic. Pip is happy that he was responsible for Herbert&amp;rsquo;s joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxviii---estella-and-ms-havisham-have-an-argument&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXVIII - Estella and Ms. Havisham have an argument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip visits Estella often at Richmond where she is staying with a lady named Mrs. Brandley and her daughter. They were people of good position and were visited by many folks. Estella has many suitors but Pip thinks she behaves familiar with him to make the other suitors jealous. Estella warns him not to be attracted to her but Pip doesn&amp;rsquo;t heed. She tells him that Ms. Havisham has asked to meet and he should take her to Satis House. They go to the house after a couple of days and see Ms. Havisham. She boasts to Pip about the many suitors that Estella has and Pip thinks that she is using Estella just to see men have heartbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day Pip sees Ms. Havisham and Estella having a big argument. Ms. Havisham calls her an Ingrate. She accuses her of being cold hearted. Estella replies back saying that she was brought up like that and she can only give what she received. She says that she has never been unfaithful to her schooling and that she has never shown her weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days, at the Finches club meeting, Drummle mentions Estella&amp;rsquo;s name and Pip is upset. When he visits Richmond, he sees the attention that Estella is paying to Drummule and confronts her and says that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it. Estella says that all she does is to entrap and deceive men, except Pip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter ends by Pip saying that a dramatic turn of event comes to his life much like the roof falling on his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xxxix---the-convict-reveals-the-truth-about-pips-patron&#34;&gt;Chapter XXXIX - The convict reveals the truth about Pip&amp;rsquo;s patron&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple of years pass by. Pip is twenty three. Pip &amp;amp; Herbert had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year, and lived in the Temple, in Garden-court, down by the river Thames. He has parted with Mr. Pocket also and he maintained good relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, when Herbert was away on Business to Marseilles, Pip receives a mysterious visitor who asks for him. After he comes in, Pip realizes that he is the convict that Pip had saved many years ago. The convict calls him &amp;lsquo;noble Pip&amp;rsquo;. He reveals to Pip that he is the patron and Pip is stunned. The convict goes on to tell him how hard he worked to make Pip a gentleman and that he is very proud now. He also tells him that he has come to London illegally with the sole purpose of seeing Pip, to see the fruit of his labor of making someone a gentleman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip is devastated by the news. He thinks of Estella and is sad that since Ms. Havisham was not the benefactor, there was never an indirect plan of Ms. Havisham keeping Estella for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stage-iii&#34;&gt;Stage III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xl---pip-confirms-the-convicts-claim-with-jaggers&#34;&gt;Chapter XL - Pip confirms the convict&amp;rsquo;s claim with Jaggers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning Pip realizes that keeping the convict hidden would not be easy at all. The Avenger was not in his service anymore. He had an old lady as maid and her niece. Asking them to not go to a room would arouse suspicion. So he decides to tell them that the convict is his uncle. It is still early morning and is dark. When he goes out, he stumbles against someone on the stairs. Pip chats with the watchman at the gate and finds out that when Pip&amp;rsquo;s uncle came in in the night, there was another man who had followed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip comes back to his quarters and finds that the convict has woken up. He comes out of his room and Pip doesn&amp;rsquo;t like his shabby looks. Pip tells him that he&amp;rsquo;s told others that he is his uncle and the convict is pleased. He said he has taken the name of Provis while here. Pip asks if he was followed yesterday to which Provis replies he didn&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During breakfast, Pip notices that Provis ate in a ravenous way and his manners were uncouth. Pip is very uneasy and does not like the man at all. Provis tosses a pocket-book bursting with money and tells Pip that all he has is Pip&amp;rsquo;s and he would like Pip to spend it on luxuries. He says he would be proud to show off Pip to all the people in the past who looked down upon him. Pip is even more worried and asks for his plans. The convict says he intends to stay there as Provis and it should not be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip goes over to Mr. Jaggers and asks him. Jaggers confirms that the convict, whose actual name is Abel Magwitch is the real benefactor. He still refers to Magwitch and Provis and two different people. Magwitch being in Australia and Provis being another person who is representing him in London. Pip buys Provis some new clothes. Herbert arrives back from his trip and is introduced to Provis who swears him to secrecy about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xli---pip-tells-herbert-about-his-actual-benefactor&#34;&gt;Chapter XLI - Pip tells Herbert about his actual benefactor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pip tells Herbert about the convict being his benefactor and that he is there illegally and wants to go by the name of Provis and live a life of luxury. Pip and Herbert agree that the best course of action is to somehow get the man out of England and try to explain to him that he is in danger if he remains in London. Pip also decides to stop accepting any more money from Provis though he is deep in debt. Since he has not been trained for any trade, he feels like he is good for nothing and being a soldier is his only option. Herbert tells him that he could always work at Clarriker. The decide to ask Provis about his past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xlii---provis-recounts-his-past-to-pip-and-herbert&#34;&gt;Chapter XLII - Provis recounts his past to Pip and Herbert&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next day breakfast, Provis tells them about his past. He grew up as an orphan on the streets, surviving by stealing small things or begging. He does not even know how he got the name Abel Magwitch. Around 20 years back, at Epsom races, he met a gentleman by the name of Compeyson. A person whom he would kill right now if he met him, he is the person who Magwitch was fighting with on the ditch as a convict many years back. Compeyson befriends Magwitch and tells him to be his partner. Magwitch finds that Compeyson is not the gentleman he looks like, his business is actually swindling, handwriting forging, stolen-bank notes, etc. There was another man named Arthur who was living with Compeyson in his home upstairs. Arthur was sick and was tended to by Compeyson&amp;rsquo;s wife out of pity. Arthur has hallucinations of a broken-hearted woman who was going to come for him. He and Compeyson had swindled a rich woman of lot of money in the past. Arthur dies after some time due to his sickness and hallucinations. Compeyson and Magwitch go about swindling and forgery, with Magwitch doing all the work and Compeyson underpaying him. They eventually get caught but the judge passes harsher sentence on Magwitch by his looks and lighter one on Compeyson thinking that he was a gentleman who was influenced badly by Magwitch.
During the imprisonment, Magwitch escapes and he gets to know from Pip that Compeyson had also escaped. So he fights with Compeyson and makes sure to put him in jail though it costs him his freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbert passes Pip a note telling him that &amp;ldquo;Young Havisham’s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham’s lover.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, instead of reading slowly and writing daily notes, I went ahead and finished the book. So, making the notes shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-xliii---pip-goes-to-meet-estella-and-ms-havisham-before-going-abroad&#34;&gt;Chapter XLIII - Pip goes to meet Estella and Ms. Havisham before going abroad.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tells them that he knows the benefactor and gets confirmation from Ms. Havisham that she had duped him into believing that she was the benefactor only to spite her relatives. Pip asks Ms. Havisham to help Mathew Pocket and Herbert. He opens his heart and professes his love to Estella but she is set to marry Drummle. Ms. Havisham is sad seeing Pip fully heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy</title>

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-10-the-return-of-the-native/ -&lt;h1 id=&#34;thoughts&#34;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first Thomas Hardy novel that I&amp;rsquo;d read, probably during my engineering days, and re-reading it brings a lot of memories back. What I realize is that I got the gist of the story but had missed out on a lot of details that Hardy provides. Nevertheless, I had become a fan of Hardy and ended up reading almost all of his books other than Jude the Obscure. The Mayor of Casterbridge remains my favorite since it kind of resembled a Bollywood movie when I read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardy was not just a writer who wrote a story. He was a history buff, a traveler, an expert in birds and plants, a biblical scholar, and more importantly, a philosopher who understood human nature very well. I felt that he put in all his knowledge into the book in order to teach, and the story was just a small part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of references to Greek mythology throughout the novel. References to Artemis, Athena, Prometheus, Scylla and Charybdis, Zeus, Olympus, Tantalus, Ulysses, Aeneas, etc. pop up in many places. Reading these references took me back to a time when I read &amp;lsquo;Purana Kathasagarangal&amp;rsquo; a book of stories from Greek mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a lot of biblical references are found throughout. Different quotes and references from the Gospels, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Book of Samuel, Judges, etc. are found in different places. Was surprised by references like - comparison of watchman recognizing Ahimaaz&amp;rsquo;s gait from afar to Mrs. Yeobright recognizing Clym&amp;rsquo;s gait, Nebuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s dreams to that of Eustacia&amp;rsquo;s, destruction of Sennacherib&amp;rsquo;s army, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He refers to history of UK (Guy Fawkes, Mary Queen of Scots) , USA (Virginia, War of Independence), Greece (Alexander the Great), India (there is a reference to Begum and Warren Hastings), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed descriptions of birds, places, plants, sometimes using botanical names, references to Darwin, are astounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there are so many philosophical insights about human nature that it is remarkable and thought provoking. For instance, he says that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity, that &lt;em&gt;a well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer.&lt;/em&gt; It made me sit and think. Viewing someone as exceptional or godly is bad for the viewer and the person!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is a great read to understand many things. Though most people would read the book during their college days, I think it is best enjoyed after you have experienced many facets of human life - childhood, adolescence, marriage, children, jobs, after you have read enough history or seen enough movies/documentaries about different cultures in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-one-the-three-women&#34;&gt;BOOK ONE THE THREE WOMEN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1---a-face-on-which-time-makes-but-little-impression&#34;&gt;1 - A Face on Which Time Makes but Little Impression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Egdon heath is the face which has not changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole of the first chapter is an intriguing introduction to the landscape that the events in the novel are based on. It is a description of Egdon heath as a powerful force of nature, as nature itself. One can almost visualize the twilight as though one is right there. About the twilight he says, it is the time of the day where when a worker looks up, he might continue to work but when he looks down or around, he might feel like it is getting darker and is time to wind up. Hardy calls the heath as a wasteland that is vast and lonely. It has brown vegetation. But he goes on to say that is has been there since prehistoric times and has been unaltered as the stars above though everything around has changed over time. He contrasts it with the sea that is renewed frequently - &amp;lsquo;distilled by the Sun and kneaded by the moon&amp;rsquo;! The sea changed, the fields changed, the rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained. He gives an imposing persona to the heath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2---humanity-appears-upon-the-scene-hand-in-hand-with-trouble&#34;&gt;2 - Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Reddleman appears with a woman (trouble) on his carriage. An old man who meets them on the way gets to know that there is a woman in the carriage and probably adds to the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A old man with a walking stick, wearing an ancient boat-cloak (cloak worn by naval officers) is seen walking alone. He sees a van far away and catches up to it. It was that of a reddleman, a person who sells reddles to the villages. Reddles are red seeds that are used to mark sheep when they are sold in fairs. The trade makes the person who sells red since the pigment spreads on clothes and skin during handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reddleman is not much of a talker but since he keeps going to the back of the van to check upon something, the old man inquires and is told that there is a lady. The old man tries to extract more information but cannot. They part ways when the reddleman says that his ponies need to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is getting darker and the reddleman looks towards the horizon and sees a woman near the barrow on top of the mountain. After a short while, she goes away and more people come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3---the-custom-of-the-country&#34;&gt;3 - The Custom of the Country&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Custom of the Country is to light a bonfire on the 5th of Nov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long chapter and there is a good amount of dialogue in it. After the first two chapters ended with no characters being named, here many are introduced.
The group that gathered around are children, men and women of the neighboring hamlets and they&amp;rsquo;ve come to light bonfires. Across the heath, you can see bonfires at different places and they&amp;rsquo;re doing it to celebrate some custom. Hardy says people have been lighting bonfires since ancient times of the Druids. Even if the reasons change, the custom remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man when, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded throughout Nature. It indicates a spontaneous, Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat that this recurrent season shall bring foul times, cold darkness, misery and death. Black chaos comes, and the fettered gods of the earth say, Let there be light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people around the bonfire include Grandfer Cantle, his son Christian, Timothy Fairway, Humphrey, Sam, Susan Nunsuch, Olly Dowden. Grandfer is quite a jolly person who sings songs and dances. Christian is just over 30 yrs and says that no woman would marry him. The folks are quite superstitious and they say that he lacks virility since there was no moon when he was born. They also say that single sleepers are visited by ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They talk about the marriage of Thomasin Yeobright and Wildeve that was to happen earlier that day. They mean to go to Wildeve&amp;rsquo;s inn and sing a song later. The marriage was opposed by Thomasin&amp;rsquo;s aunt openly in the church and later she had agreed. They also mention that Mrs. Yeobright&amp;rsquo;s son Clym is soon returning and they seem to have an admiration for him. They look at a bonfire a bit faraway that is burning steadily and mention that it might be due to wood being used. They mention that it might be by Eustacia, Captain Vye&amp;rsquo;s granddaughter. They don&amp;rsquo;t speak favorably of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They dance as the fire dies out, Christian gets frightened when reddleman appears who has come towards them asking the way to Mrs. Yeobright&amp;rsquo;s house. A few minutes after the reddleman leaves, Mrs.Yeobright comes. She takes Olly and goes towards Wildeve&amp;rsquo;s Inn, The Quite Woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persons with any weight of character carry, like planets, their atmospheres along with them in their orbits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4---the-halt-on-the-turnpike-road&#34;&gt;4 - The Halt on the Turnpike Road&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Mrs. Yeobright halts to talk to Diggory Venn and finds out the bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yeobright and Olly walk down the hill and when they reach the road Olly goes towards her home and as Mrs. Yeobright is about to enter the Inn, she sees a horse and a van nearby and the reddlemen walking alongside. She goes and talks to him to find out that her neice is no in Wildeve&amp;rsquo;s Inn but in the carriage, that she did not get married earlier in the day as expected. Thomasin gets down from the carriage, Mrs. Yeobright and she walk toward the Inn to confront Wildeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5---perplexity-among-honest-people&#34;&gt;5 - Perplexity among Honest People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Probably indicates the surprise in the village folk who came to dance and found Thomasin inside and not outside with Wildeve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says that if he promised to marry her, he must do it, otherwise, it would bring great shame to the family. Wildeve explains that it couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen because of an issue with licence. They had gone to Anglebury to register the marriage but since it was made out for Budmouth, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t useful in Anglebury. Thomasin tries to defend Wildeve. She says that she was upset and decided to come back by herself and not with Wildeve and that it was not his mistake. Wildeve promises that the marriage will happen in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, the earlier group of people come to celebrate the wedding. Wildeve asks the Yeobrights to stay in the room while he goes to entertain. He gives them drinks and chats with them. They leave and when he comes back, he finds the Yeobrights to have already left by the open window at the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looks outside and sees one bonfire still being lit and knows that it is a sign for him. He goes towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6---the-figure-against-the-sky&#34;&gt;6 - The Figure against the Sky&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Figure against the sky that reddleman saw was Eustacia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chapter we learn that the old man who had spoken to reddlemen was Eustacia&amp;rsquo;s grandfather. He had put one-and-one together and informed Eustacia that probably the marriage didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. She lights the fire to signal Wildeve to come to her thinking that he called of the wedding in the last minute because of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has asked Johnny Nunsuch, a boy in the neighborhood to tend to the bonfire and goes once in a while to the barrow to check on Wildeve&amp;rsquo;s Inn through a telescope and then comes back. She asks the boy if he heard a frog jump on the lake to which he replies no. Her grandfather asks her to come indoors and she says she will. After a while, the boy tells her that he heard a frog jump. She sends him off with a sixpence and we see Wildeve coming over after the boy leaves. He tells her that she does not give him peace with the lighted bonfire that does not die out. She tells that she is upset that he chose Thomasin over her. But that she is glad that he didn&amp;rsquo;t marry due to his love for her. Wildeve explains that it was no the case and it was due to a licence issue. But they continue to chat about their love for each other. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow him to kiss her though. He leaves and she goes to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7---queen-of-night&#34;&gt;7 - Queen of Night&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Description of Eustacia as a Queen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter is a detailed character sketch of Eustacia. She is described as exceptionally beautiful. Her father was a bandmaster in the navy and was lucky to have married the captain&amp;rsquo;s daughter. Her grandfather was not quite happy about it since he was from a noble family. Other aristocratic roots, comparisons to greek gods are also made. She is also portrayed as a very passionate person who has highly romantic notions in her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fidelity in love for fidelity&amp;rsquo;s sake had less attraction for her than for most women; fidelity because of love&amp;rsquo;s grip had much. A blaze of love, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same which should last long years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though she grew up in Budmouth, she is now at Edgon heath with her grandfather after he dad passed away. She hates being here and is always in expectation of something grand to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To dwell on a heath without studying its meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue. The subtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia; she only caught its vapours. An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet, a suffering woman a devotee, a pious woman a psalmist, even a giddy woman thoughtful, made a rebellious woman saturnine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;8---those-who-are-found-where-there-is-said-to-be-nobody&#34;&gt;8 - Those Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = The boy Johnny finds Wildeve and Eustacia together and later stumbles upon Diggory Venn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy Johnny Nunsuch is going towards his home happy with the money he got from Eustacia. On the way he gets frightened with something and decides to go back and ask Eustacia to lend a servant to walk back with him. But once he reaches there he finds Eustacia talking to Wildeve and he is caught in what Hardy calls as &amp;lsquo;Scyllaeo-Charybdean&amp;rsquo; position (after rock and a whirlpool in greek mythology). He decides to not disturb them, musters courage and goes towards his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, he gets frightened of something and slips and falls near Diggory Venn. Venn asks him some questions and finds out about Wildeve meeting with Eustacia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;9---love-leads-a-shrewd-man-into-strategy&#34;&gt;9 - Love Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Diggory Venn hatches a plan to eavesdrop on Wildeve and Eustacia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardy explains that women used to scare their children by saying &amp;lsquo;the reddleman is coming for you&amp;rsquo;. He says that ordinary people don&amp;rsquo;t take up the trade though it is vanishing. Reddlemen are wanderers like gypsies but they look down upon gypsies. Sometimes people take up the reddle trade as a penance after some wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venn returns to his van and takes up an old letter to read. It is a letter from Thomasin where she explain why she couldn&amp;rsquo;t marry him. She does see him that way. Looks like the spurned marriage offer is what made Venn to leave his father&amp;rsquo;s dairy farming and go into reddle trade. He still cares for Thomasin and is upset and Eustacia and Wildeve are causing pain to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the boy had told him that Eustacia and Wildeve had agreed to meet on the Rainbarrow, Venn goes there daily to see if they are. The first three days pass by withouth incident. The fourth day, he sees them meet. He hides in a nearby bush and manages to overhear the conversation. Wildeve wants Eustacia to go away to America but she does not say yes or no. They depart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venn goes back to his van and decides to have a word with Eustacia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10---a-desperate-attempt-at-persuasion&#34;&gt;10 - A Desperate Attempt at Persuasion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Diggory Venn tries to persuade Eustacia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venn goes to Mistover Knap first thing the next morning. He sees the grandfather at the entrance who offers him a drink. Venn says he is there to meet Ms. Vye. Since it is too early, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get to meet in spite of waiting for some time. So he goes outside and waits while walking around. She comes after some time. He broaches the subject of Wildeve and Thomasin but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t take the hint. He then comes in the open an accuses her of the person who is holding the marriage by controlling Wildeve. He asks her to release Wildeve. She is shocked. But refuses by saying &amp;ldquo;he was mine before he was hers! He came back because he liked me best!&amp;quot;. Since he knows that she hates the heath, he even offers her employment in Budmouth through a reference from his uncle. But she still refuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11---the-dishonesty-of-an-honest-woman&#34;&gt;11 - The Dishonesty of an Honest Woman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Mrs. Yeobright tells Wildeve that she is going to give Thomasin to another suitor though she had said no to Diggory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Venn is walking back towards his van, he sees Mrs. Yeobright walking towards the Quiet Women to meet Wildeve. He goes over and talks to her. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell her why he thinks Wildeve may not marry Thomasin since he knows that Eustacia has him fully charmed. He proposes his hand in marriage. But Mrs. Yeobright doesn&amp;rsquo;t agree since Thomasin hadn&amp;rsquo;t agreed two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this new information, Mrs. Yeobright goes into the Inn and talks to Wildeve. In order to force his hand, she says that Thomasin has another suitor who is ready to marry her. Wildeve is surprised. Contrary to what Mrs. Yeobright expected, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, he goes to meet Eustacia and tells her that their path is clear since Thomasin has another suitor and that she is not interested in him anymore. Eustacia is shocked by this and almost immediately loses interest in him. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;What was the man worth whom a woman inferior to herself did not value?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, she says to herself. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t commit and tells him that she will give a final answer on Monday at 8 by the Rainbarrrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that night, her grandfather returns and tells her that Mrs. Yeobright&amp;rsquo;s son Clym Yeobright is coming home to spend Christmas with his mother. He is coming back from Paris where he had spent the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1---tidings-of-the-comer&#34;&gt;1 - Tidings of the Comer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Eustacia overhears news of Clym who is about to come to Egdon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, late in the afternoon around 3 PM, Eustacia is standing in the kitchen near the chimney and she could hear men talking outside. The men would be Sam and Humphrey, the furze cutters, who are stacking up the furze, closely watched by Captain Vye. They&amp;rsquo;re talking about Clym as they do their work. They&amp;rsquo;re proud of him and hold him in high esteem. He is said to be working for a diamond merchant in Paris. After the captain leaves, they talk among themselves, saying that if there was anyone who was a match for Clym it was Eustacia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eustacia spends the whole afternoon daydreaming about Clym. Later in the evening, she decides to go and have a look at Yeobrights&amp;rsquo; home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2---the-people-at-blooms-end-make-ready&#34;&gt;2 - The People at Blooms-End Make Ready&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = Mrs. Yeobright and Thomasin are getting ready for Clym&amp;rsquo;s arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yeobright and Thomasin has busy preparing for Clym&amp;rsquo;s arrival, Thomasin is on the attic to gather apples. Both are talking as they do their work. After that, they go out to gather berries. Thomasin tells her aunt to not mention the marriage with Wildeve to Clym.

&lt;p&gt;Eustacia is near Blooms-End but does not see any motion or light there. As she is going back, she sees 2 women and a man coming on the way. As they reach nearer, she knows that the women and Mrs. Yeobright and her neice. The man says &amp;ldquo;Good Night&amp;rdquo;. Since it is darks, she is not able to hear him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thinks of the voice the whole night and has vivid dreams in the night. For the next few nights, she walks around the heath to catch a glimpse of him by some chance encounter but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustacia&amp;rsquo;s grandfather gives permission to the mummers to come and practice in his fuelhouse. Eustacia watches them practicing and comes to know that they are going to perform at Blooms-End on Monday night. She sees this as a great opportunity to see Clym since she was afraid that he might go away after Christmas. She influences Charley to take a break on the day when they&amp;rsquo;re going to play at Blooms-End and let her play the part diguising as someone else, instead. In exchange he gets to kiss her hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charley is one of the Egdon mummers for the present year, and he and the other mummers practice in Captain Vye&amp;rsquo;s house for the play &amp;ldquo;Saint George.&amp;rdquo; On the night they are to perform in Mrs. Yeobright&amp;rsquo;s house, Eustacia arranges to take Charley&amp;rsquo;s place in order to see Clym and study him in the guise of the Turkish Knight. Some of the boys recognize her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eustacia rests after the play an surveys the room to look for Clym. She gets her chance to see him. When she sees him talking to Thomasin, she regrets having come in disguise thinking that in her natural form she could have charmed him. Mrs. Yeobright asks the mummers to stay for dinner and they&amp;rsquo;re happy. The mummers were not in a hurry to leave. So she goes outside to wait for them while watching the moon. Clym comes by and asks her if she were a women disguised as Turkish knight. She says yes but doesn&amp;rsquo;t reveal who she is. Having accomplished what she came to do, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t wait for others and goes home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While returning, Eustacia remembers that it is Monday night and she had an appointment with Wildeve to let him know her decision. But since the time has passed and she is no longer interested in him, she is now indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venn meets with Eustacia and tells her that he saw Wildeve waiting at the Rainbarrow for a long time previous night.

Venn delivers the letter and Wildeve decides to marry Thomasin to make Eustacia suffer. The next day, Wildeve goes to Blooms-End and asks Thomasin. She accepts in order to protect the pride of her family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clym Yeobright was famous in the neighborhood from his childhood. He was a bright kid, people were in awe of him and began to always expect great things from him. Hardy mentions a quote by a Jesuit here -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;It is bad when your fame outruns your means.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Probably, the hype around him was greater than he could match. So, when he went to Paris to work, the expectation grew even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when he says, during haircutting at Fairways, that he is leaving behind his excellent job in Paris and staying back at Egdon to start a school, people are surprised. They commend his good-heartedness but feel that he would learn things in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes on to say that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clym&amp;rsquo;s mother is shocked by his decision and tells him that everyone thinks of going forward in life and his decision is definitely a step backward. While they are discussing, Christian Cantle comes in and says that Susan Nunsuch had pricked Eustacia Vye in the church to verify if she were a witch. Eustacia had fainted. Clym&amp;rsquo;s curiosity is aroused and he wants to know more about Eustacia. He puts one and one together and wonders if Eustacia had come to his house disguised as a Turkish knight the other day. Sam says that few folks are going over to Captain Vye&amp;rsquo;s home later that day to retrieve a bucket that has falled into the well and he could get to meet Eustacia if he wants to.&lt;/p&gt;

They&amp;rsquo;re not able to and leave to come back next day. Clym stays back and talks to Eustacia. Since she says there is no water other than the one in the pool which is dirty, he decides to use a pail to get some water from the well, asks her to hold one end of the rope but in the process, Eustacia gets injured when the rope drags off her palm and takes the skin off. They talk and he tells her of his desire to become a schoolteacher and thinks that she would be a good help since she is an educated woman. After that, they meet often, much to the disappointment of his mother. His mother thinks that he decided to stay back due to Eustacia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Mrs. Yeobright finds out that Clym and Eustacia have been meeting frequently, she is shocked at the second bitter thing that her son has done.&lt;/p&gt;

It is sad to know that she got to know from outside and not from her own son. Mrs. Yeobright doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a good opinion of Eustacia or her family and doesn&amp;rsquo;t think that is a right match. They argue very badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes out of the home, talks to Eustacia and tells her that they should get married right away. He tells her about his plan to temporarily rent a cottage until he is able to set up a school and move to Budmouth.&lt;/p&gt;

She will give it later when she comes by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildeve learns of Eustacia&amp;rsquo;s wedding to Clym and is surprised. He now feels like he made a mistake in marrying Thomasin and should have gone for Eustacia.&lt;/p&gt;

He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know that it is money but feels bad for the lack of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yeobright gives the money to Christian Cantle asking him to give one half to Thomasin and another to Clym as wedding gift. On the way, Christian stops at Wildeve&amp;rsquo;s Inn and does some gambling. He wins and likes the game. During the course he reveals that he needs to go to Mistover to give a gift to Thomasin.

Thomasin had sent it couple of days after receiving it. Mrs. Yeobright questions Christian and gets to know that he didn&amp;rsquo;t do what he was asked off and had lost all the money to Wildeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Yeobright thinks that may be Wildeve gave it to Thomasin and Eustacia. When Eustacia visits her grandfather&amp;rsquo;s house, Mrs. Yeobright goes over and asks her about it.

&lt;h3 id=&#34;7---the-night-of-the-sixth-of-november&#34;&gt;7 - The Night of the Sixth of November&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = The night on which Eustacia is hoping to flee
Clym sends the letter but when it reaches Mistover, her grandfather finds Eustacia to be already asleep. Eustacia sleeps early in anticipation of fleeing that night. She gives a signal to Wildeve around 8 hoping to meet him at midnight. The agreement was for him to take her to Budmouth. He had hinted that he was open to helping her, also willing to flee with her if she was ok. When Eustacia is ready to go in the night, it rains heavily. Around the time that she is waiting for Wildeve, Susan Nunsuch creates a wax doll of Eustacia&amp;amp;quots likeness, sticks it with pins and puts it into the fireplace, muttering incantations while it is being burnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;8---rain-darkness-and-anxious-wanderers&#34;&gt;8 - Rain, Darkness, and Anxious Wanderers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = It is raining, Eustacia is waiting in despair. Others, Clym, Wildeve, Venn, Thomasin are anxiously searching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eustacia is waiting at Rainbarrow in spite of the rain. Clym is waiting at Blooms-End thinking that Eustacia might have read the letter and might come visiting. Thomasin arrives in rain, tells Clym that she believes Wildeve and Eustacia are planning to elope. The captain comes soon after since he doesn&amp;rsquo;t find Eustacia at home and tells Clym about her wanting to commit suicide. They all go out in search. Thomasin meets Diggory Venn on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;9---sights-and-sounds-draw-the-wanderers-together&#34;&gt;9 - Sights and Sounds Draw the Wanderers Together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning of the title&lt;/strong&gt; = The lamp brings Clym to Wildeve and later Venn to the same place.
Clym sees the gig-lamp and approaches it to see Wildeve. Eustacia decides to jump into the water since Clym doesn&amp;rsquo;t want her and her only option is to be Wildeve&amp;rsquo;s mistress, as she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any money. Wildeve and Clym hear the sound of body falling on water. Wildeve immediately jumps into the water. Clym is more careful and find out a safer place to get into water. Venn comes by in a short while and he gets into the water. He is able to save Clym. Eustacia and Wildeve are dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bodies are taken to the Inn. Charley arrives and is shocked by the death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;book-six-aftercourses&#34;&gt;BOOK SIX AFTERCOURSES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel logically ends after Book 5. So Book 6 is more like a sequel.
Thomasin sells the Inn, comes and lives with her cousin Clym at Blooms-End. Venn has given by reddle trade and has become a prosperous dairy farmer. He calls sometimes. He weds Thomasin. Clym becomes a preacher.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leadership - Essential Books</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-03-reading-list-leadership/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-03-reading-list-leadership/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-03-reading-list-leadership/ -&lt;p&gt;The following two quotes sum up my ideal of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; ~ Ronald Reagan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;A leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; ~ Lao Tzu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of books on leadership. Even if you read a couple of them repeatedly, the leadership ideal in your mind gets renewed. However media or popular literature of a period portrays it, over the course of human history, leadership has always been about altruism. About someone deciding to take responsibility for someone other than themselves, someone deciding to step up and be the &amp;lsquo;shepherd that gives his life to the lamb&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ll expand on this thought later. The focus of this post is to list some outstanding books that could be helpful in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/books/2020-06-09-the-goal-goldratt/&#34;&gt;The Goal&lt;/a&gt; I happened to land on a website named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tocinstitute.org/the-goal-summary.html&#34;&gt;TOC Institute&lt;/a&gt; which had a detailed summary of the Goal. It mentions that &lt;strong&gt;​The Goal&lt;/strong&gt; is one of three books that Jeff Bezos requires his top management team to read. The 3 books are -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060833459/&#34;&gt;The Effective Executive&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Drucker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244/&#34;&gt;The Innovator&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt; by Clayton Christensen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951&#34;&gt;The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement&lt;/a&gt; by Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Jeff Cox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read 1 &amp;amp; 3 and am yet to read #2. I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend 1 &amp;amp; 3 to anyone. Over the last decade, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to groom engineers to become tech leads, architects and first-time engineering managers . Teaching and coaching are my core strengths and I think if I get to do more of it, I&amp;rsquo;d definitely have more of a sense of fulfillment. For the managers, two books that I&amp;rsquo;ve always recommended are &lt;strong&gt;Management&lt;/strong&gt; by Drucker and &lt;strong&gt;Good to Great&lt;/strong&gt; by Jim Collins. In fact, the revised edition of &lt;strong&gt;Management&lt;/strong&gt; has an awesome foreword by Jim Collins. My top 3 books would be the following -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Management-Rev-Ed-Peter-Drucker/dp/0061252662/&#34;&gt;Management : Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Drucker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996/&#34;&gt;Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;/a&gt; by Jim Collins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/How-Become-CEO-Rising-Organization/dp/0786864370&#34;&gt;How to Become CEO: The Rules for Rising to the Top of Any Organization&lt;/a&gt; by Jeffrey Fox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, there are many more great books and a few more come to my mind at this time. Couple of years back, one of my team leads suggested &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897/&#34;&gt;The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Path&lt;/a&gt; and I found it to be an excellent read, especially for folks in management in tech companies. Two other books by Jim Collins that I found to be super inspirational were - &lt;strong&gt;Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck&amp;ndash;Why Some Thrive Despite Them All&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies&lt;/strong&gt;. I listened to the audiobook version of these books during my runs in the past, and they were special because Jim Collins himself narrates them in his very persuasive and inspiring voice. Other books that come to mind are &lt;strong&gt;The 5 Levels of Leadership - Proven Steps to Maximize Your Potential&lt;/strong&gt; by John C. Maxwell, &lt;strong&gt;Start with Why&lt;/strong&gt; by Simon Sinek, and &lt;strong&gt;Multipliers - How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter&lt;/strong&gt; by Liz Wiseman.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Favorite TV Title Sequence Themes</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-02-favorite-tv-intro-themes/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-02-favorite-tv-intro-themes/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-02-favorite-tv-intro-themes/ -&lt;p&gt;Was listening to the awesome title sequence of &lt;strong&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/strong&gt; again today. It is one of those pieces of music that keep replaying in your mind even after you stop listening to it. I love listening to Intro sequence themes and there are some iconic ones among American TV shows. For a long time, &lt;strong&gt;Fringe&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Arrow&lt;/strong&gt; themes were my favorite and I used to play them on youtube whenever I wanted to relax, close my eyes and just listen to music. A few years back, I happened to see the title sequence of &lt;strong&gt;The Expanse&lt;/strong&gt; on Youtube and I was like, I must see this series. It was only available on Syfy that time and when it came on Prime, I was super happy. I think that a great opening sequence is critical to the success of a show. Cannot imagine &lt;strong&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt; without its legendary title sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here is a list of title sequences of shows that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and think are great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;top-5&#34;&gt;Top 5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;his-dark-materials&#34;&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Software Development - Essential Books</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-01-reading-list-software-dev/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-01-reading-list-software-dev/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-07-01-reading-list-software-dev/ -&lt;p&gt;As a person who loves checking off items in &amp;lsquo;to-do&amp;rsquo; lists and checklists, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked books that have a &lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;rules/principles&lt;/strong&gt;. Hence books like &lt;strong&gt;Effective Java&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;201 Principles&lt;/strong&gt; are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Development, like other engineering disciplines, is fulfilling when executed within the frameworks of principles laid out by experts in the past. Choice of wrong architecture, wrong coding practices, even wrong names, give a lot of grief to people who have to debug production issues or maintain the systems. Many times, it is much simpler to rewrite the entire application than do patches on top of badly written software. While dealing with production issues is when one always wishes that people were better informed on basic principles and thought through things. DRY (Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself), SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) and KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid) are principles that everyone should live by. The best practical guide to Software Development is surely &lt;strong&gt;Code Complete 2&lt;/strong&gt; by Steve McConnell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;books-with-lists&#34;&gt;Books with Lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the top books with lists that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997/&#34;&gt;Effective Java&lt;/a&gt; by Joshua Bloch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Software-Development-Alan-Davis/dp/0070158401&#34;&gt;201 Principles of Software Development&lt;/a&gt; by Alan M. Davis&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;201 principles may have many principles that are dated, but many more are super relevant today. We&amp;rsquo;re now in the &amp;lsquo;no-code&amp;rsquo; development age where a lot of user-facing applications get created by dragging and dropping widgets from a UI. Also a lot of boilerplate code is written by the machine. So, one would hope that the actual code itself is modularized, clean and easier to find troublesome spots. Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll enter into a phase where people cannot write bad code. Like Java took away the memory management headache from simple-to-medium applications forever. One had to still think of garbage collection and JVM tuning for applications that handled millions of requests. But most people don&amp;rsquo;t operate in the &amp;lsquo;league of big wigs&amp;rsquo; at all. (Haha, was about to say &amp;lsquo;league of big boys&amp;rsquo;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years back, I&amp;rsquo;d asked DB, a senior executive that I respect a lot, to recommend a book based on his vast experience. He suggested reading any book by Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob). Yup, his books are great. &lt;strong&gt;Clean Code&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Clean Coder&lt;/strong&gt; are excellent reads and good reference materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uber-list&#34;&gt;Uber List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my uber list that I hope to revisit to update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/&#34;&gt;Programming Pearls, 2nd Edition&lt;/a&gt; by Jon Bentley&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Regular-Expressions-Cookbook-Solutions-Programming/dp/1449319432/&#34;&gt;Regular Expressions Cookbook 2nd Edition&lt;/a&gt; by Jan Goyvaerts, Steven Levithan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319/&#34;&gt;CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software&lt;/a&gt; by Charles Petzold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have added the famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Programming-Volumes-1-4A-Boxed/dp/0321751043/&#34;&gt;The Art of Computer Programming&lt;/a&gt; by Donald Knuth but I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the series myself. Bill Gates himself mentioned this as an essential reading for programmers and it does figure in all the lists of great books on software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I mentioned &lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; by CLRS above, the book is great as a reference and not for reading through fully in a short span of time. I&amp;rsquo;d really recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Sanjoy-Dasgupta/dp/0073523402/&#34;&gt;Algorithms&lt;/a&gt; by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou &amp;amp; Vazirani or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365&#34;&gt;Algorithms to Live By&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Christian &amp;amp; Tom Griffiths or Tim Roughgarden&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm course on Coursera. Robert Sedgewick&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X&#34;&gt;Algorithms&lt;/a&gt; is great if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for code in Java. One of my Graduate projects was in Rabin-Karp hashing algorithm and I relied entirely on the substring search section of the book. Sections 5.3 (substring search) and 5.5 (compression) are an excellent read for anyone who is new to those concepts. The fact that I remember the sections and can visualize the black and red text on the pages, itself is a testament to the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put &lt;strong&gt;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&lt;/strong&gt; as #1 because that is what most software engineers do. I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in huge re-engineering efforts of legacy code to new stack multiple times. There are many excellent books that have essays with inputs from multiple experts. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Best-Software-Writing-Selected-Introduced/dp/1590595009&#34;&gt;Best Software Writing&lt;/a&gt; by Joel Spolsky and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483/&#34;&gt;Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Seibel, come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-28-coursera-gcp-fundamentals-course/ -&lt;h1 id=&#34;thoughts&#34;&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a sweeping introduction to all the various products under the Google Cloud umbrella, this is definitely the one you need to go through. The spectrum of offerings and the span that they cover amazed me. I had the knowledge of a few things - like GCE, App Engine, etc. but surely walked away with a lot more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite sections were the labs and the sessions around Storage Options. Storage is an area that I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved working on. Initially, I was intrigued as to why there were so many solutions - Cloud Storage, BigTable, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datastore, and then as I got to know more, they made sense. There was a neat table comparing and contrasting the features and use-cases. The labs were well organized, easy to do, and taught the concepts well. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t do the videos and just do the quizzes and the labs, it&amp;rsquo;s still worth the time. The other cool thing about the course was the availability of slides for each of the modules. They were excellent. Most of the Coursera courses don&amp;rsquo;t give slides (which is unfortunate), so it was great to see the slides. They were of high quality and very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the presentation and the pro-GCP argument, is quite compelling. Anyone who goes through the material would be convinced that there is no other offering in the world that matches the scale of Google. (Talk about Steve Jobs&amp;rsquo; Reality distortion field).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt; at the beginning of every module is from Coursera and the notes are some bullet points that I took down after going through each section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;module-1---introducing-google-cloud-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module 1 - Introducing Google Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-concepts&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain the advantages of Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the components of Google&amp;rsquo;s network infrastructure, including: Points of presence, data centers, regions, and zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;welcome-to-gcp-fundamentals&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to GCP Fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Rice from the Google Cloud training team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCP offers four main kinds of services: compute, storage, big data and machine learning.The course focuses mostly on the first two, together with the topic of networking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-cloud-computing&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is cloud computing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) definition - Cloud computing is a way of using I.T. that has these 5 equally important traits -
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers get computing resources on-demand and self-service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers access these resources over the net from anywhere they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The provider of those resources has a big pool of them and allocates them to customers out of that pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resources are elastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ref -&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-definition-cloud-computing&#34;&gt; https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-definition-cloud-computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-did-we-get-here&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Wave - Physical/Colocated - Instead of building costly capital intensive data centers, companies could rent space in shared facilities. (&lt;em&gt;While at ebay, I remember visiting one of the data centers and seeing one section of the building that had hardware dedicated to the company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Wave - Virtualized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third Wave - Serverless - Containerization and automated services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;every-company-is-a-data-company&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every company is a data company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In future, every company will become a data company, differentiating from their competitors in terms of great software centered on data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gcp-computing-architectures&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCP computing architectures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IaaS - Provides raw compute, storage, and network similar to the ways in which you handle physical machines. e.g. GCE, EC2. Once you get a GCE instance, you can install OS, and needed libraries, deploy applications after that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PaaS - Provides platform that you can deploy your application on. i.e, provides OS, middleware and the runtime. All that you need to do is to deploy your application. E.g. App Engine, Heroku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SaaS - Provides software in the cloud. E.g. G Suite, Dropbox, Workday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-google-network&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Google network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s network carries as much as 40 percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s Internet traffic every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network interconnects at more than 90 Internet exchanges and more than 100 PoP worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gcp-regions-and-zones&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCP regions and zones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regions are independent geographic areas. Locations within regions tend to have round-trip network latencies of under 5 milliseconds on the 95th percentile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A zone is a deployment area within a region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCP&amp;rsquo;s services and resources can be multi-regional, regional, or zonal. App Engine, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage, BigQuery are examples of multi-regional deployments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of 2019, Google Cloud Platform has 17 active regions, with more to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environmental-responsibility&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All existing data centers use roughly two percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s electricity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s data centers were the first to achieve ISO 14001 certification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s data center in Hamina, Finland, has a cooling system that uses seawater from the bay of Finland to reduce energy use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest corporate purchasers of wind and solar energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has been a hundred percent carbon neutral since 2007.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-offers-customer-friendly-pricing&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google offers customer-friendly pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google was the first major Cloud provider to deliver per second billing (!) for IaaS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the best-known GCP services are billed by the second, including GCE and GKE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCE has automatically applied sustained discounts. i.e., if you run and instance for over 25% in a month, discounts are applied for additional minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-apis&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open APIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCP services are compatible with open source products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Bigtable uses the interface of the open source database Apache Hbase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Dataproc offers the open source big data environment Hadoop, as a managed service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TensorFlow is an open source software library for machine learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes gives customers the ability to mix and match microservices running across different clouds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Stackdriver lets customers monitor workload across multiple cloud providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is classic Google. Truly altruistic. So many freebees and open standards. One could argue that no company in the world has done so much to lift the average person out of ignorance. All the free things have unlocked many unknown areas of the human potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-choose-google-cloud-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why choose Google Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variety of solutions - computing, storage, big data, machine learning and application services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global, cost-effective, open source friendly, designed for security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;multi-layered-security-approach&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-layered security approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since Google has around 10 services each with over a billion users, you can be sure that security is one of key foundations and is ensured at every letter from bottom up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware: Both the server boards and the networking equipment are custom-designed. Google also designs custom chips, including a hardware security chip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure boot stack:Cryptographic signatures over the BIOS, bootloader, kernel, and base operating system image, ensure that the right software stack is booted up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premises security: Google designs and builds its own data centers, with multiple layers of physical security protections and limited access. The physical security measures also ensured on third-party data centers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inter-service communication is encrypted: The infrastructure provides cryptographic privacy and integrity for remote procedure call (“RPC”) data on the network.&lt;br&gt;
Identity Service: The central identity service goes beyond asking just for username &amp;amp; password. It intelligently challenges users for additional information based on risk factors. Users can enable 2FA including devices based on the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) open standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption at rest:Encryption (using centrally managed keys) is applied at the storage services layer. Also has hardware encryption support in hard drives and SSDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure Frond end: GFE ensures that all TLS connections are terminated using correct certificates and following best practices such as supporting perfect forward secrecy. Additionally has protection against DoS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DoS protection: Has multi-tier, multi-layer DoS protections that further reduce the risk of any DoS impact on a service running behind a GFE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrusion detection: Rules and machine intelligence give operational security engineers warnings of possible incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing insider risk: Google aggressively limits and actively monitors the activities of user with elevated access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee U2F use: To guard against phishing attacks against Google employees, employee accounts require use of U2F-compatible Security Keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software development practices: Google employs central source control and requires two-party review of new code. Google also provides its developers libraries that prevent them from introducing certain classes of security bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ref:&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/security/infrastructure/design&#34;&gt; https://cloud.google.com/security/infrastructure/design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;budgets-and-billing&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budgets and Billing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCP provides four tools to make sure that a customer doesn&amp;rsquo;t accidentally run up a huge bill. -budgets and alerts, billing export, reports and quotas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budges &amp;amp; Alerts - You can define budgets per billing account or per GCP project. Budget limits and alerts can be configured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Billing export - lets you store detailed billing information in places where it&amp;rsquo;s easy to retrieve for more detailed analysis like BigQuery dataset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reports - Visual tool in the GCP console that allows you to monitor your expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quotas - There are two types of quotas: rate quotas and allocation quotas. They are designed to prevent the over-consumption of resources, whether because of error or malicious attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;module-2-getting-started-with-google-cloud-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module 2 Getting Started with Google Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-concepts-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the purpose of projects, folders, and organization nodes on Google Cloud Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the purpose of and use cases for Identity and Access Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List the methods of interacting with Google Cloud Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a solution deployment using Cloud Launcher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;module-introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects are the main way you organize the resources you use in GCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers use Google Cloud Identity, and Access Management, also called IM, or IAM to control who can do what&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different levels of security responsibility : On-prem - everything from physical security to application security is handled by the customer. As you go from IaaS to PaaS to Managed services, the amount handled by cloud provider increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-google-cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Google Cloud Platform resource hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource hierarchy - At the top level is organization node. It can have list of folders which can also have folders. Folders can have projects. Projects have all the resources (VMs, storage buckets, tables, etc.). Policies are inherited downwards in the hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects are the basis for enabling and using GCP services. Managing APIs, billing, etc. happen at the project level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cloud Resource Manager provides methods that you can use to programmatically manage your projects in Google Cloud Platform. E.g. Get list of projects, create new, update, delete, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project attributes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project ID - Globally unique, Chosen by you, Immutable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project name - Need not be unique, Chosen by you, Mutable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project number - Globally unique, Assigned by GCP, Immutable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;identity-and-access-management-iam&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity and Access Management (IAM)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can assign policies to resources at a level of granularity you choose. Folders offer flexible identity management. Usually policies are assigned at folder level and the projects and resources inherit the policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To use folders, you need an organization node at the top of the hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iam-roles&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAM roles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organization Policy Administrator - Broad control over all cloud resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project creator - fine-grained control over the project resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organization node would already exist if you&amp;rsquo;re a G Suite customer, if not, you can use Google Cloud Identity to create one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The policies implemented at a higher level in this hierarchy can’t take away access that’s granted at lower level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IAM defines - &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Can do what&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;On which resources&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rdquo; - 4 types of principals -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google account (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:test@gmail.com&#34;&gt;test@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;) or Cloud Identity user (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:test@example.com&#34;&gt;test@example.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service account (test@project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google group (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:test@googlegroups.com&#34;&gt;test@googlegroups.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Identity or G Suite domain (example.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can do what&amp;rdquo; - a defined role that has a list of permissions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.g. InstanceAdmin - create, delete, start, stop and change an instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;On which resource&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign role on a specific element of the resource hierarchy - GCE instance instance_a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 types of IAM roles - Primitive, Pre-defined, Custom
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primitive roles are broad. You apply them to a GCP project, and they affect all resources in that project. They offer fixed, coarse-grained levels of access. E.g. Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predefined roles apply to a particular GCP service in a project. They offer more fine-grained permissions on particular services. E.g. Compute Engine’s instanceAdmin role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom roles let you define a precise set of permissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service accounts -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an identity for carrying out server-to-server interactions in a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used to authenticate from one service to another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interacting-with-google-cloud-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interacting with Google Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can interact with GCP using different kinds of user credentials
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gmail accounts or Google Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;G Suite user accounts and groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Identity domain users and groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For option #3, if you already have users are groups defined in an LDAP system (say MS AD), Google Cloud Directory Sync can be used for one-way sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 4 ways to interact with GCP
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Platform Console - Web user interface
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer tools - Cloud Repositories (git), Cloud Shell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Shell and Cloud SDK - Command-line interface
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CLI tools - gcloud, gsutil (Cloud Storage), bq (BigQuery),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Available as docker image, available via cloud shell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Console Mobile App - For iOS and Android
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mobile app allows you to start, stop, and SSH into Compute Engine instances, and to see logs from each instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REST-based API - For custom applications
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API explorer provides list of APIs. There are also client libraries to make the integration easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-marketplace-formerly-cloud-launcher&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Marketplace (formerly Cloud Launcher)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lets you quickly deploy functional software packages that run on Google Cloud Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packages offered by Google or third-pary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;module-3---virtual-machines-in-the-cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module 3 - Virtual Machines in the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-concepts-2&#34;&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the purpose of and use cases for Google Compute Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarize the various Google Cloud Platform networking and operational tools and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;module-introduction-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute Engine lets you run virtual machines on Google&amp;rsquo;s global infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the module, we look at how GCE works and also focus on virtual networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;virtual-private-cloud-vpc-network&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPC networks connect your Google Cloud Platform resources to each other and to the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can segment your networks, use firewall rules to restrict access to instances, and create static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPC networks are global, subnets are regional. Subnets can span the zones that make up a region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compute-engine&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compute Engine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute Engine lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.  You configure a virtual machine much like you build out a physical server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create a virtual machine instance by using the Google Cloud Platform Console or the gcloud command-line tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per-second billing, sustained use discounts, committed use discounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preemptible instances - you&amp;rsquo;ve given Compute Engine permission to terminate it if its resources are needed elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High throughput to storage at no extra cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom machine types: Only pay for the hardware you need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale up or scale out. In 2018, the maximum number of virtual CPUs in a VM was 96, and the maximum memory size was in beta at 624.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;important-vpc-capabilities&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important VPC capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPCs have routing tables similar to physical networks. These are used to forward traffic from one instance to another instance within the same network, even across subnetworks and even between GCP zones, without requiring an external IP address. VPCs’ routing tables are built in;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPCs give you a global distributed firewall you can control to restrict access to instances, both incoming and outgoing traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPCs can talk to each other either through shared VPC or VPC peering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Load Balancing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully distributed, software-defined, managed service for all your traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Cloud Load Balancing, a single anycast IP front-ends all your backend instances in regions around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides cross-region load balancing, including automatic multi-region failover, which gently moves traffic in fractions if backends become unhealthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPC offers a suite of cloud balancing options -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global HTTP(S) - Layer 7 load balancing based on load, Can route different URLs to different back ends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global SSL Proxy - Layer 4 load balancing of non-HTTPS SSL traffic based on load, Supported on specific port numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global TCP Proxy - Layer 4 load balancing of non-SSL TCP traffic, Supported on specific port numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regional - Load balancing of any traffic (TCP, UDP), Supported on any port number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regional internal - Load balancing of traffic inside a VPC,  Use for the internal tiers of multi-tier applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8) is a DNS service offered to Internet users worldwide by Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Cloud DNS, is a DNS hosting service, a managed DNS service running on the same infrastructure as Google. Cloud DNS is also programmable. You can publish and manage millions of DNS zones and records using the GCP Console, the command-line interface, or the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CDN
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud CDN - Uses Google&amp;rsquo;s globally distributed edge caches to cache content close to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve set up HTTP(S) Load Balancing, simply enable Cloud CDN with a single checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interconnect Options
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPN - Secure multi-Gbps connection over VPN tunnels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct Peering - Private connection between you and Google for your hybrid cloud workloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrier Peering - Connection through the largest partner network of service providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dedicated Interconnect - Connect N X 10G transport circuits for private cloud traffic to Google Cloud at Google POPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partner Interconnect - Connectivity between your on-premises network and your VPC network through a supported service provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;module-4---storage-in-the-cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module 4 - Storage in the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-concepts-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarize the purpose of and use cases for: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, and Cloud Bigtable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose between the various storage options on Google Cloud Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a BigQuery table using data from Cloud Storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use SQL queries to analyze data stored in BigQuery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-google-cloud-platform-storage-options&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Google Cloud Platform Storage Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different applications and workloads required different storage database solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This module reviews the main storage options in GCP: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Data Store and Google Big Table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-storage&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Storage is binary large-object storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object storage - you say to your storage, &amp;ldquo;Here, keep this arbitrary sequence of bytes&amp;rdquo; and the storage lets you address it with a unique key. In Google Cloud Storage, these unique keys are in the form of URLs, which means object storage interacts well with web technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypts your data on the server side,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data traveling between a customer&amp;rsquo;s device and Google is encrypted by default using HTTPS/TLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be accessed as a File System via third-party tools such as Cloud Storage FUSE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline Media Import/Export - A third-party solution that allows you to load data into Google Cloud Storage by sending your physical media (HDDs, tapes, etc.) to a third-party service provider who uploads data on your behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Import - Cloud Storage Transfer Service enables you to import large amounts of online data into Google Cloud Storage quickly and cost-effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Storage files are organized into buckets.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bucket attributes -&amp;gt; Globally unique name, Storage class, Geo Location, IAM policies or ACLs (can be overridden for objects), Object versioning setting (store past versions), Object lifecycle management rules (delete after 90 days).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four different types of storage classes: Regional, Multi-regional, Nearline and Coldline.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regional - Accessed frequently in a specific region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-regional - geo-redundant. Most frequently accesses across a broader geo location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearline - Accessed less than once a month.  Low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coldline - Accessed less than once a year. Very-low-cost, highly durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-storage-interactions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Storage interactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several ways to bring data into Cloud Storage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online transfer - Self-managed copies using command-line tools (gsutil) or drag-and-drop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage Transfer Service - Scheduled, managed batch transfers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer Appliance - rackable, high-capacity storage server that you lease from Google Cloud. You simply connect it to your network, load it with data, and then ship it to an upload facility where the data is uploaded to Cloud Storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other ways to getting data into Cloud Storage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BigQuery &amp;amp; Cloud SQL - Import export tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Engine - Logs, Cloud Datastore backups, images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute Engine - instance startup scripts, CE images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-cloud-bigtable&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Bigtable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Bigtable - Google&amp;rsquo;s NoSQL big data database service. Powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideal for applications that need very high throughput and scalability for non-structured key/value data, where each value is typically no larger than 10 MB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Bigtable is offered through the same open source API as HBase, the native Hadoop database. This enables portability of applications between HBase and Bigtable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attributes - Replicated storage, Data encryption in-flight and at rest, Role-based ACLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose Bigtable if data is Big (&amp;gt;1TB), Fast (rapidly changing, time series), NoSQL (not tied to a schema)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access Patterns
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API - Read and write through data service layer like HBase REST Server, or a Java Server using the HBase client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming - Data can also be streamed in through a variety of popular stream processing frameworks like Cloud Dataflow Streaming, Spark Streaming, and Storm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batch Processing - Data can also be read from and written to Cloud Bigtable through batch processes like Hadoop MapReduce, Dataflow, or Spark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-cloud-sql-and-google-cloud-spanner&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud SQL and Google Cloud Spanner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud SQL - Managed RDBMS
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic replication - Replication from Cloud SQL master instance, external master instance, external MySQL instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed backups - retains up to 7 backups for each instance, which is included in the cost of your instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vertical scaling (read and write) - Easily scale up to 64 processor cores and more than 100 GB of RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontal scaling (read) - Quickly scale out with read replicas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security - data encrypted  at rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessible by other GCP services and even external services.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Engine - Access using standard drivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute Engine - Access Cloud SQL instances using an external IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External services - Access using standard drivers like Connector/J for Java or MySQLdb for Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Spanner - Horizontally scalable managed RDBMS
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong global consistency, including strongly consistent secondary indexes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High availability through synchronous and built-in data replication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for DB sizes exceeding 2 TB and 10s of thousands of R/W per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-cloud-datastore&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Datastore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontally scalable NoSQL DB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports ACID transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schema less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access through RESTful interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High availability of reads &amp;amp; writes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparing-storage-options&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing Storage Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Storage -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blob store, No transactions, No complex queries, Capacity PB+, per unit 5TB/object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use case - structured and unstructured binary or object data, like images, large media files and backups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BigTable -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NoSQL wide column, transaction for single row, No complex queries, Capacity in PB+, 10MB per cell, 100 MB per row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use case - analytical data with heavy read and write events, like AdTech, financial or IoT data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud SQL -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relational SQL for OLTP, supports transactions, complex queries, Capacity upto 10 TB, per row size determined by DB engine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use case - web frameworks and existing applications, like storing user credentials and customer orders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Spanner -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relational SQL for OLTP, supports transactions, complex queries, Capacity in PB, 10GB per row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large-scale database applications that are larger than 2 TB. For example, for financial trading and e-commerce use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Datastore  -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No SQL document store, supports transactions, no complex queries, capacity in TB, 1 MB per entity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use case - Semi-structured application data that is used in App Engine applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;module-5---containers-in-the-cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module 5 - Containers in the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-concepts-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the concept of a container and identify uses for containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the purpose of and use cases for Google Container Engine and Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy and manage Docker containers in Kubernetes Engine using the kubectl command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;containers-kubernetes-and-kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containers, Kubernetes, and Kubernetes Engine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison Overview -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute Engine, IaaS offering, with access to servers, file systems, and networking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Engine, PaaS offering, with access to preset runtimes, managed services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes Engine is a hybrid which conceptually sits between the two and benefits from both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Container ?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute Engine - the smallest unit of compute is a VM, where you can configure anything from runtime, disk I/O, networking, web server, DB, etc. As the demand increases, you have to copy an entire VM and boot the guest OS for each instance of your app, which can be slow and costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Engine - packages everything including services and dependent libraries, scales automatically. But does not have the flexibility of compute engine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container - gives independent scalability of PaaS and access to OS and hardware like IaaS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An invisible box around your code and its dependencies, with limited access to its own partition of the file system and hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to create and starts as a process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is like virtualizing the OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So you can go from development, to staging, to production, or from your laptop to the cloud, without changing or rebuilding anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-kubernetes-and-gke&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Kubernetes and GKE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them as microservices, and deploy rollouts and rollbacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker - An open-source tool that defines a format for bundling your application, its dependencies, and machine-specific settings into a container;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Container Builder - a tool similar to Docker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a Dockerfile to specify how your code gets packaged into a container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;docker build&amp;rdquo; command to build the container. This builds the container and stores it locally as a runnable image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;docker run&amp;rdquo; command to run the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes is a set of APIs that you can use to deploy containers on a set of nodes called a cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-hybrid-and-multi-cloud-computing-anthos&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Computing (Anthos)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time required to complete an on-premises upgrade could be anywhere from several months to one or more years. It may also be quite costly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid/multi-cloud architecture allows you to keep parts of your systems infrastructure on-premises while moving other parts to the Cloud, creating an environment that is uniquely suited to your company&amp;rsquo;s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anthos - hybrid and multi-cloud solution powered by the latest innovations in distributed systems, and service management software from Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anthos relies on Kubernetes and Google Kubernetes engine deployed on-prem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Explain the purpose of and use cases for Google App Engine and Google Cloud Datastore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare the App Engine Standard environment with the App Engine Flexible environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express the purpose of and use cases for Google Cloud Endpoints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express the purpose of and use cases for Apigee Edge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preview an App Engine application using Cloud Shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch an App Engine application and then disable it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-app-engine&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to App Engine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Engine is PaaS solution for building scalable web applications and mobile backends. It manages the infrastructure so that the consumers can focus on building applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides you with hardware and networking infrastructure, built-in services and APIs such as NoSQL datastores, memcache, load balancing, health checks, application logging, and a user authentication API, common to most applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No servers to maintain. App Engine will scale your application automatically in response to the amount of traffic it receives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Scanner automatically scans and detects common web application vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works with popular development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, Maven, Git, Jenkins, and PyCharm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-app-engine-standard-environment&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google App Engine Standard Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containers are preconfigured with available runtimes which include libraries that support standard APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous task queues, scheduled tasks for triggering events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with other Google cloud services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limitations
4. No writing to local file system
5. Requests timeout at 60s
6. 3rd part software installations are limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example standard workflow -
7. Develop &amp;amp; test the web application locally
8. Use the SDK to deploy to App Engine
9. App Engine automatically scales &amp;amp; reliably serves your web application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-app-engine-flexible-environment&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google App Engine Flexible Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of the sandbox, App Engine Flexible Environment lets you specify the container your application runs in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison with Standard
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard - Instance startup in Milliseconds, SSH access No, Write to local disk No, Support for 3rd-party binaries No, Network access Via App Engine services, Pricing model - Daily free use, after that daily use, pay per instance class, with automatic shutdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible - Instance startup in Minutes, SSH access Yes (needs to be enabled), Write to local disk Yes (ephemeral), Support for 3rd-party binaries Yes, Network access Yes, Pricing model - pay resource allocation per hour, no automatic shutdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-cloud-endpoints-and-apigee-edge&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Endpoints and Apigee Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Cloud Platform provides two API management tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Endpoints - A distributed API management system. It provides an API console, hosting, logging, monitoring, and other features to help you create, share, maintain, and secure your APIs. You can use Cloud Endpoints with any APIs that support the OpenAPI Specification (Swagger spec).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses distributed Extensible Service Proxy which is a service proxy based on NGINX that runs in its own Docker container for better isolation and scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apigee Edge - A platform for developing and managing API proxies. It has a different orientation, though: it has a focus on business problems like rate limiting, quotas, and analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;module-7---developing-deploying-and-monitoring-in-the-cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module 7 - Developing, Deploying and Monitoring in the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-concepts-6&#34;&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand options for software developers to host their source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the purpose of template-based creation and management of resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the purpose of integrated monitoring, alerting, and debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a Deployment Manager deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update a Deployment Manager deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the load on a VM instance using Stackdriver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;development-in-the-cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development in the cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Source Repositories -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides Git version control to support collaborative development of any application or service,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are using the Stackdriver Debugger, you can use Cloud Source Repositories and related tools to view debugging information alongside your code during application runtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSR also provides a source viewer that you can use to browse and view repository files from within the Google Cloud Platform Console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to bitbucket, you can have any number of private repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Functions -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a cool concept. It is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small functions that execute without having to manage a server or a runtime environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are billed, to the nearest 100 milliseconds, only while your code is running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Functions are written in Javascript and execute in a managed Node.js environment on Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deployment-infrastructure-as-code&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment: Infrastructure as code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment Manager -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An infrastructure management service that automates the creation and management of GCP resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To use Deployment Manager, you create a template file, using either the YAML markup language or Python, that describes what you want the components of your environment to look like. The Deployment Manager figures out and does the actions needed to create the environment your template describes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monitoring-proactive-instrumentation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring: Proactive instrumentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stackdriver -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCP&amp;rsquo;s tool for monitoring, logging, and diagnostics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives you access to many different kinds of signals from your infrastructure platforms, virtual machines, containers, middleware, and application tier: logs, metrics, traces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives you insight into your application’s health, performance, and availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 core components of Google Stackdriver: monitoring, logging, trace, error reporting, debugging, profiler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Kerala - Russia Connection</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-25-kerala-russia-connection/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-25-kerala-russia-connection/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-25-kerala-russia-connection/ -&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d mentioned in another &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/blog/2020-06-07-like-a-psalm/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;d do some research on Kerala-Russia connection and get back. This post is in response to that. First some context on what we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wife read the post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/blog/2020-06-07-like-a-psalm/&#34;&gt;Oru Sangeerthanam Pole&lt;/a&gt; and really got fascinated by Perumbadavam and Dostoyevsky. She got busy reading articles on Dostoyevsky and Perumbadavam and also a couple of Perumbadavam&amp;rsquo;s interviews on Youtube. I joined in, and we watched a few interviews together. Other than reading the famous book accidentally, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about the man himself. What comes across through the interviews is the portrait of a humble, down-to-earth, emotional person. He definitely is an incredible human being. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB6YJYt-7OU&#34;&gt;interview with Shiny Jacob&lt;/a&gt; in a Church was great. An &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTnjzgjBrBI&#34;&gt;interview done by Rayson Kuriakose&lt;/a&gt; on the bank of a river, was also very touching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AK also started reading &amp;lsquo;The Brothers Karamazov&amp;rsquo;. Just the past week, she was reading an essay by Turgenev about an execution in Paris. Now that I think of it, she told me about Turgenev&amp;rsquo;s essay, and that&amp;rsquo;s probably when I remembered that I had a copy of &amp;lsquo;Crime and Punishment&amp;rsquo;, looked it up and remembered how I happened to get the book and how I got to know about Dostoyevsky. Ah, many times, it is great to unravel why we got into something; &lt;em&gt;Why did we start reading that particular book?, Why did we start watching a specific TV series or a movie?, Why did we start talking about a topic that we never touched upon for years?, etc.&lt;/em&gt; While talking to her after writing the post, I was a bit confused about when I actually read &amp;lsquo;Oru Sangeerthanam Pole&amp;rsquo;. It might have been at Viveknagar library as I mentioned in the earlier &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/blog/2020-06-07-like-a-psalm/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. It might also have been at Babuchan&amp;rsquo;s house. Or it might have been in Manorama weekly. What I clearly remember are the black and white illustrations of specific scenes on some pages. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fond of illustrations in books since they reveal a lot. It is also a chance to check where in the book that scene occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got talking about our interest in Russian literature and how unbeknownst to us, it was an influential force. It might have been through movies or friends or other connections. That too, we both are Malayalis who grew up outside Kerala. If we had grown up in Kerala, the influence might have been higher. Realized that the village bordering Tengana, the place where we have a home in Kerala, is named &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow,_India&#34;&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;! Haha. Yes, we have visited Moscow in Kerala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are some articles that I was able to lookup on Google about Kerala&amp;rsquo;s connection with the Soviet Union, especially with literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artiles-on-kerala-russia-connection&#34;&gt;Artiles on Kerala-Russia connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newslaundry.com/2016/10/06/keralas-love-affair-with-soviet-literature&#34;&gt;Kerala&amp;rsquo;s Love Affair with Soviet Literature&lt;/a&gt; by Maya Palit. Oct 6, 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She starts with the story of how here uncle gifted her books by Russian author Lyudmila Petrushevskaya and how she found the stories very relatable. Then she talks about the success of Oru Sangeerthanam Pole in the 90s, and about the docu-fiction film &lt;strong&gt;In Return — Just a Book&lt;/strong&gt;, based on the novel, directed by Shiny Jacob and scripted by the famous writer, Paul Zacharia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She mentions that though Communist thought entered Kerala and began taking root in the 1930s and 40s, it was in the 50s that Russian literature was introduced to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kesari Balakrishna Pillai was one of the initial people to bring Russian translations to the common people. He started with translations of Chekhov&amp;rsquo;s books and published through Kesari, a periodical that he ran.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1952, Prabhath Book House got the rights to import Russian books. The books, especially the periodicals, were heavily subsidized by the Sovient Union and they cost only Rs. 2 or 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NK Damodaran&amp;rsquo;s was the first to translate Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s works from English to Malayalam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She mentions that the real harbinger of Russian literature in a massive way, was a man named K &amp;lsquo;Moscow&amp;rsquo; Gopalakrishnan. In 1966, the Soviet government decided to publish Russian writings in Malayalam. They invited Gopalakrishnan, who was the joint editor of the &amp;lsquo;Soviet Review&amp;rsquo; in Delhi at the time, to Progress Printers in Moscow. He and his wife Omana Gopalakrishnan, translated close to 200 Russian books into Malayalam, including Party literature, folk tales, the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maya quotes author KR Meera saying &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The children of the 70s were shaped more by the Soviet Union than India.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maya talks about friends who remember their introduction to Dostoevsky, Gorky and Tolstoy through Malayalam publications, which by all accounts, were very colorful, printed on great quality paper, beautifully-produced and really cheap. Also talks about children&amp;rsquo;s magazine named &amp;lsquo;Sputnik&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She quotes KR Meera saying that Russian literature was everywhere, that before brown paper came along, they used to cover notebooks for school with the glossy paper from Soviet Land magazines!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She ends with a note that Kerala&amp;rsquo;s lyublyu (love) for Russian literature appears to have tempered down and that the new generation definitely has missed out. I agree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-22-cybersecurity-reading-list/ -&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing a note about &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/blog/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey&#34;&gt;My Reading Journey&lt;/a&gt;, I was reminded that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t put a section on list of books related to Computer Science in &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/blog/reading-list&#34;&gt;My Reading List&lt;/a&gt;. Been thinking of doing that. Will do it one of these days. Today&amp;rsquo;s WSJ had a section in the end on Cybersecurity. It had interesting articles like &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;The industries most vulnerable to cyberattack and why&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;How and when to teach kids to use passwords&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;The dangerous secrets our photos reveal&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;The added security risks of working from home&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, etc. Each article was well articulated and thought provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention was an article named &amp;ldquo;A cybersecurity reading list&amp;rdquo;. I checked online and the same article was titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-cybersecurity-books-that-everyone-shouldand-canread-11592579360?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&amp;amp;tpl=cy&#34;&gt;Five Cybersecurity Books That Everyone Should and Can Read&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Though I&amp;rsquo;ve linked the article here, you might not be able to see it since it is probably paywalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was eager to see if the list had books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read or heard about. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;d heard of only 2 books - &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Countdown to Zero Day&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Kim Zetter and &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;The Cuckoo&amp;rsquo;s Egg&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Clifford Stoll. The Cuckoo&amp;rsquo;s Egg is on my Amazon wishlist but haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to buying or reading it yet. I&amp;rsquo;d read of Cyberattack being referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Fifth Domain&amp;rdquo; of warfare but didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the book. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t read any and surely must read a couple before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;top-5-books-from-wsj-article&#34;&gt;Top 5 books from WSJ article&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5 books are as follows -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Stuxnet-Launch-Digital-Countdown-Paperback/dp/B015M0KYGM/&#34;&gt;Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World&amp;rsquo;s First Digital Weapon&lt;/a&gt; by Kim Zetter&lt;/strong&gt;. Stuxnet is regarded as the world&amp;rsquo;s first digital weapon. It is the malware that crippled Iran&amp;rsquo;s nuclear-fuel enrichment program. In the book, Kim Zetter investigates the malware and provides a detailed account of the timeline from origin to release. Along the way, she explains key cybersecurity concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Cuckoos-Egg-Tracking-Computer-Espionage/dp/1416507787&#34;&gt;The Cuckoo&amp;rsquo;s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage&lt;/a&gt; by Clifford Stoll&lt;/strong&gt;. Lawrence Berkeley Lab is less than an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive from my home. So it actually feels like something that happened right here. In the book, Stoll is assigned to investigate an accounting error of 75 cents and that leads into a computer espionage story of chasing after an unauthorized user who was in their systems. I&amp;rsquo;m excited at the thought of reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Domain-Defending-Companies-Ourselves/dp/0525561986/&#34;&gt;The Fifth Domain: Defending Our Country, Our Companies, and Ourselves in the Age of Cyber Threats&lt;/a&gt; by Richard Clarke and Robert Knake&lt;/strong&gt;. The authors are former government cyber officials from the past 3 administrations. They describe the current efforts to advance security and prevent cyberwarfare and also analyze incidents from the past. The book is a warning as well as a study guide for everyone to understand the looming threat of cyber warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Cult-Dead-Cow-Original-Supergroup/dp/1541762363/&#34;&gt;Cult of the Dead Cow&lt;/a&gt; by Joseph Menn&lt;/strong&gt;. I have a newfound respect for Beto O&amp;rsquo;Rourke after learning that he was part of &lt;strong&gt;cDc&lt;/strong&gt; (Cult of the Dead Cow) which is the oldest, most respected, and most famous American hacking group of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Sandworm-Cyberwar-Kremlins-Dangerous-Hackers/dp/0525564632/&#34;&gt;Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin&amp;rsquo;s Most Dangerous Hackers&lt;/a&gt; by Andy Greenberg&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the title is a reference to the giant sandworms in Dune/Arrakis. Those are huge and dangerous beings with mouth as large as 40 meters (over 100 ft!!). For a description of Dune&amp;rsquo;s sandworms see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NZiTVPXmNM&#34;&gt;Ultimate Guide To Dune (Part 1) The Introduction&lt;/a&gt;(12:13). In Sandworm (the book), Andy Greenberg, a journalist for Wired, writes about cyber incidents from 2014 to the release of NotPetya malware in 2017. Causing over $10 billion in damage, the malware destroyed public utilities (especially Electric grids) in Ukraine and other European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a Google search of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Cybersecurity Books That Everyone Should Read&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; to add to this list, or may be make it to 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-top-security-book-lists&#34;&gt;Other top security book lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fivebooks.com/best-books/cyber-security-josephine-wolff/&#34;&gt;The Best Cyber Security Books&lt;/a&gt; recommended by Josephine Wolff has the following -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spam Nation: The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime-from Global Epidemic to Your Front Door&lt;/strong&gt; by Brian Krebs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World&amp;rsquo;s First Digital Weapon&lt;/strong&gt;  by Kim Zetter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worm: The First Digital World War&lt;/strong&gt; by Mark Bowden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War&lt;/strong&gt; by Fred Kaplan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bytes, Bombs, and Spies: The Strategic Dimensions of Offensive Cyber Operations&lt;/strong&gt; by Amy Zegart &amp;amp; Herbert Lin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/the-best-cyber-security-books/&#34;&gt;The 11 Best Cyber Security Books — Recommendations from the Experts&lt;/a&gt; from HashedOut has the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacking: The Art of Exploitation (2nd Ed.)&lt;/strong&gt; by Jon Erickson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of Invisibility: The World’s Most Famous Hacker Teaches You How to Be Safe in the Age of Big Brother and Big Data&lt;/strong&gt; by Kevin Mitnick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World’s Most Wanted Hacker&lt;/strong&gt; by Kevin Mitnick, William L. Simon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography&lt;/strong&gt; by Simon Singh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World&lt;/strong&gt; by Joseph Menn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Engineering: The Science of Human Hacking&lt;/strong&gt; by Christopher Hadnagy&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat Modeling: Designing for Security&lt;/strong&gt; by Adam Shostack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see Simon Singh&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Code Book&amp;rdquo;, though. I think WSJ&amp;rsquo;s 5-book recommendation is great for a beginner and covers a lot of topics to get some real insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are always thousands of lists and a lot of choices. But a better strategy to get through the books is to have a smaller set to read or to have a couple of text books that you read over and again. For e.g. CLRS book on Algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Security Threat Models</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-18-threat-models/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-18-threat-models/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-18-threat-models/ -&lt;p&gt;Came across a list of Threat Models in a book on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Trust-Networks-Building-Untrusted/dp/1491962194/&#34;&gt;Zero Trust Networks&lt;/a&gt; that I just started reading. I had heard of two models in the past - STRIDE and DREAD in the context of security thread classification and ranking for Cyber-physical systems &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/5/4/27&#34;&gt;Seifert &amp;amp; Reza (2016)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going into the popular models, what is Threat Modeling? There was a small section on Threat Modeling in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/tech-notes/2020-06-14-coursera-cybersecurity-course/#week-6---creating-a-company-culture-for-security&#34;&gt;IT Security course&lt;/a&gt; that I wrote about recently. It mentions that Security Risk assessment starts with Threat Modeling. The goal is to identify likely threats to systems, assign them priorities that correspond to severity and probability. This is done by brainstorming from the perspective of an outside attacker and figuring out what high value targets an attacker may want to go after, and then review possible attack vectors that could be used to gain access to the high value assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book mentions the following and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick read on the other 3 to find out what they are and summarize all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STRIDE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DREAD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PASTA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VAST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STRIDE and DREAD were developed at Microsoft. Chapter 3 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff648644(v=pandp.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN&#34;&gt;Improving Web Application Security: Threats and Countermeasures&lt;/a&gt; talks in detail about these.  STRIDE is used in &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Step 4. Identify the Threats&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and DREAD in &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Step 6. Rate the Threats&lt;/em&gt;&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stride&#34;&gt;STRIDE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/commerce-server/ee823878(v=cs.20)&#34;&gt;STRIDE&lt;/a&gt; is derived from an acronym for the following six threat categories. The goal is to bucketize the threats into these categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;poofing identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ampering with data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;epudiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nformation disclosure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;enial of service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;levation of privilege&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dread&#34;&gt;DREAD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once classification is done, DREAD acronym can be used to asking the following questions to arrive at a risk rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;amage potential: How great is the damage if the vulnerability is exploited?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eproducibility: How easy is it to reproduce the attack?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;xploitability: How easy is it to launch an attack?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ffected users: As a rough percentage, how many users are affected?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;iscoverability: How easy is it to find the vulnerability?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter has a Risk rating table that is very useful in coming up with a combined rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pasta&#34;&gt;PASTA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PASTA is an acronym for &amp;lsquo;Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis&amp;rsquo;.  It provides a seven-step process for aligning business objectives and technical requirements, taking into account compliance issues and business analysis. The intent of the method is to provide a dynamic threat identification, enumeration, and scoring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;trike&#34;&gt;Trike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trike is an open source threat modeling methodology and tool. There are two implementations of Trike. One is a spreadsheet, and the other is a standalone desktop tool. The high level idea is to model threats based on requirements of a system (assets) and the &amp;lsquo;acceptable&amp;rsquo; level of risk defined by stakeholders of the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vast&#34;&gt;VAST&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VAST is an acronym for Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat. It is based on an automated threat-modeling platform named  ThreatModeler, creates two types of models - Application and Operational threat models. Application model represents architectural POV and Operational model represents attacker POV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-models&#34;&gt;More Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article from CMU is more comprehensive and goes over 12 threat models - &lt;a href=&#34;https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2018/12/threat-modeling-12-available-methods.html&#34;&gt;https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2018/12/threat-modeling-12-available-methods.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;threat-modeling-tools&#34;&gt;Threat Modeling tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model#Threat_modeling_tools&#34;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; on Thread Modeling mentions many tools used for Threat Modeling. Of the list, I&amp;rsquo;ve used SD Elements in the past. In that, the first step is to complete a questionnaire (created based on compliance requirements) and the system generates a set of threat vectors and actions that need to be taken to overcome the threats.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IT Security: Defense against the digital dark arts</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-14-coursera-cybersecurity-course/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-14-coursera-cybersecurity-course/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-14-coursera-cybersecurity-course/ -&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent course. It is a great refresher of a lot of cybersecurity concepts that most engineers might have heard of but not know. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know much, it would be much more useful since you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better knowledge of the attack vectors and all vulnerabilities that surround us daily. If you know, it will help in filling up many blank spots in your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enthusiasm, knowledge, expertise, and the presentation skills of the instructor Gian Spicuzza, who is a Program Manager with the Android Security team, really was the differentiator, in addition to the content of the course. He definitely is my model Program Manager, someone who is great technically and is able to articulate his ideas very well. After the course, I&amp;rsquo;m confident of being able to teach an introductory course in IT Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course Link - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/it-security/&#34;&gt;https://www.coursera.org/learn/it-security/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Commitment &amp;amp; Learning Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who has a foundation in CS and had some experience, I think the course can be done in a week&amp;rsquo;s time by spending around 2 hours per day. My strategy was to watch the videos (say at 1.5x speed) while on the move (say running on the treadmill), download the transcripts, and read through them while sitting, review transcripts while answering the quizzes. Most of the learning comes from answering the questions in the quizzes and the qwiklab labs. I thoroughly loved the qwiklab labs. They were the best hands-on learning experience that I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the course creators had shared the slides, the learning strategy could be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt the quizzes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through the slides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review some videos for concepts that are not clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt the quizzes again to possibly score 100%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the hands-on labs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-1---understanding-security-threats&#34;&gt;Week 1 - Understanding Security Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define and recognize security risks, vulnerabilities and threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to identify the most common security attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand how security revolves around the CIA principle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to IT Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro to the instructor - Gian Spicuzza, Overview of the course, other stuff about navigating coursera, using discussion forum, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malicious Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CIA Triad
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CIA = confidentiality, integrity, and availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidentiality - keeping things hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrity - keeping data accurate and untampered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability - Information is readily accessible for those who need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential Security Terms

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the how symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the most common algorithms of cryptography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the most appropriate cryptographic method given a scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symmetric Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptography
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The topic of cryptography, or hiding messages from potential enemies, has been around for thousands of years. It has evolved greatly now with the advent of modern technology, computers and telecommunications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption is the act of taking a message, called plaintext, and applying an operation to it, called a cipher, and creating a garbled/unreadable/different from original message, called ciphertext. The reverse process, is called decryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cipher is actually made up of two components, the encryption algorithm and the key. The algorithm is the underlying logic and is usually complex mathematical operations. The key is something unique to the specific cipher in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerckhoff&amp;rsquo;s principle (Shannon&amp;rsquo;s maxim / &amp;lsquo;enemy knows the system&amp;rsquo;) -  This principle states that a cryptosystem, or a collection of algorithms for key generation and encryption and decryption operations that comprise a cryptographic service should remain secure, even if everything about the system is known except for the key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptography - overarching discipline that covers the practice of coding and hiding messages from third parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptology - Study of cryptography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptanalysis - trying to decipher coded messages (Reminded of Dan Brown&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Da Vinci Code&amp;rdquo;). E.g. of a machine - Collossus during World war 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steganography - practice of hiding information from observers, but not encoding it. (like writing a message using Invisible Ink!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A note in the reading material - A mentioned above, the algorithm for encryption is usually complex mathematical operations. Mostly it is large prime number factorization which is currently computationally difficult. But if quantum computing become a reality, then brute force attacks to break the keys would be easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symmetric Cryptography
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symmetric Cryptography - Use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages. For e.g. ROT-13 is a Caesar cipher that uses a key of 13, which means a text is encrypted by rotating each character in the alphabet by 13 letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stream cipher - takes a stream of input and encrypts the stream one character or one digit at a time, outputting one encrypted character or digit at a time. So, there&amp;rsquo;s a one- to-one relationship between data in and encrypted data out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block cipher - takes data in, places that into a bucket or block of data that&amp;rsquo;s a fixed size, then encodes that entire block as one unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialization vector (IV) - Random data that&amp;rsquo;s integrated into the encryption key and the resulting combined key is then used to encrypt the data. This is to avoid key reuse. IV is sent in plaintext along with the encrypted message. e.g - 802.11 frame of a WEP encrypted wireless packet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symmetric Encryption Algorithms
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DES (Data Encryption Standard) - designed by IBM in the 70s with inputs from NSA. Was adopted as an official FIPS, Federal Information Processing Standard for the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DES is a symmetric block cipher that uses 64-bit key sizes and operates on blocks 64-bits in size. Since 8-bits are used for parity checking, in reality, the key length is 56 bits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means there are 2^56 or 72 quadrillion possible keys to guess from. In the 70s, it seemed like a huge task to determine the key using brute force but in 1998 the EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation, decrypted a DES-encrypted message in only 56 hours!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2001, NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology, adopted AES, Advanced Encryption Standard. AES is the first and only public cipher that&amp;rsquo;s approved for use with top secret information by NSA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AES is similar to DES but it uses 128-bit blocks, twice the size of DES blocks, and supports key lengths of 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key things to note while adopting an algorithm -&amp;gt; Should be implementable in software or hardware, should be easy to implement, should be fast enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some platforms implement cryptographic algorithms in hardware to accelerate the processes and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove some of the burden from the CPU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RC4, or Rivest Cipher 4, is a symmetric stream cipher that gained widespread adoption because&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;of its simplicity and speed. RC4 is not used anymore. Though it supports key sizes from 40-bits to 2,048-bits, the cipher itself has inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities that have been exploited many times. RC4 was used in many protocols - WEP for wireless encryption, WPA, was used in SSL and TLS till 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The preferred secure configuration is TLS 1.2 with AES GCM, a specific mode of operation for the AES block cipher that essentially turns it into a stream cipher. GCM, or Galois/Counter Mode, works by taking randomized seed value, incrementing this and encrypting the value, creating sequentially numbered blocks of ciphertexts.
Symmetric encryption is very convenient. But the key issue is with the fact that same key is used and it needs to be shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Key or Asymmetric Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asymmetric Cryptography
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asymmetric encryption - different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process - generate a private key, then using this private key, generate a public key. It should be almost impossible (computationally very difficult) to figure out corresponding private key given a public key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Person A uses Person B&amp;rsquo;s public key to encrypt the message which the Person B decrypts using his private key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital signature - If Person B also wants to validate that the message came from Person A, then Person A could compose the message and combine it with his/her private key to generate a digital signature. Person B could use Person A&amp;rsquo;s public key to validate the signature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asymmetric cryptosystem grants us - confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidentiality is granted through the encryption-decryption mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authenticity is granted by the digital signature mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-repudiation is granted by digital signature &amp;amp; encryption/decryption mechanism. The person who is sending the message cannot deny that it was sent from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid - Asymmetric is used to share keys and symmetric is used for actual data encryption/decryption. This also safety as well as speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A MAC (Message Authentication Code) is a bit of information that allows authentication of a received message, ensuring that the message came from the alleged sender. Similar to digital signature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popular - HMAC (Keyed-Hash MAC). HMAC uses a cryptographic hash function along with a secret key to generate a MAC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSA - Rivest Shamir Adleman. Released to public domain by RSA Security in the year 2000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSA - Digital Signature Algorithm - used for signing and verifying data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DH - Diffie-Hellman - key exchange algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECC - Elliptic curve cryptography is a public key encryption system that uses the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields to generate secure keys. The benefit of elliptic curve based encryption systems is that they are able to achieve security similar to traditional public key systems with smaller key sizes. So, for example, a 256 bit elliptic curve key, would be comparable to a 3,072 bit RSA key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECDH and ECDSA -  elliptic curve variants of DH and DSA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hashing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hashing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hashing (hash function) - a type of function or operation that takes in an arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of a fixed size, called a hash or a digest. output is unique to the input, such that two different inputs should never yield the same output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptographic hash functions are used for various applications like authentication, message integrity, fingerprinting, data corruption detection and digital signatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptographic hash function should be one-directional, deterministic, quick to compute and be efficient, not possible to retrieve plain text, small change in input should result in a different output and there should be no correlation b/w input change and output, not have hash collisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hashing Algorithms
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MD5 is a popular and widely used hash function designed in the early 1990s as a cryptographic hashing function. It operates on a 512 bit blocks and generates 128 bit hash digests. Due to the vulnerabilities in the hash function (hash collision issue), it was recommended to stop using MD5 for cryptographic applications by 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SHA-1 is part of the secure hash algorithm suite of functions, designed by the NSA and published in 1995. It operates a 512 bit blocks and generates 160 bit hash digest. SHA-1 is another widely used cryptographic hashing functions, used in popular protocols like TLS/SSL, PGP SSH, and IPsec. SHA-1 is also used in version control systems like Git, which uses hashes to identify revisions and ensure data integrity by detecting corruption or tampering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many organizations have recommended replacing SHA-1 with SHA-2 or SHA-3 due to vulnerabilities in SHA-1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A MIC (message integrity check) - a hash digest of the message, a checksum to ensure integrity. It is different from MAC and the main goal is protecting against accidental corruption or loss, but not protecting against tampering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hashing Algorithms (continued)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of passwords for user login. The password is usually hashed and stored so that a bad action will not be able to get the plain text. Sometimes it is hashed multiple times making the retrieval even harder for malicious actors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rainbow table - a pre-computed table of all possible password values and their corresponding hashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SALT - A password salt is additional randomized data that&amp;rsquo;s added into the hashing function to generate the hash that&amp;rsquo;s unique to the password and salt combination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptography Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public Key Infrastructure
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PKI is a system that defines the creation, storage and distribution of digital certificates. A digital certificate is a file that proves that an entity owns a certain public key. A certificate contains information about the public key, the entity it belongs to and a digital signature from another party that has verified this information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CA (Certificate Authority) - The entity that&amp;rsquo;s responsible for storing, issuing, and signing certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RA (Registration Authority) - Responsible for verifying the identities of any entities requesting certificates to be signed and stored with the CA. Usually CA performs both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL or TLS server certificate. This is a certificate that a web server presents to a client as part of the initial secure setup of an SSL, TLS connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self Sign Certificate - The certificate has been signed by the same entity that issued the certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL or TLS client certificate - certificates that are bound to clients and are used to authenticate the client to the server, allowing access control to a SSL, TLS service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code signing certificates - used for signing executable programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Root Certificate Authority. These root certificates are self signed because they are the start of the chain of trust. If the root CA signs a certificate and sets a field in the certificate called CA to true, this marks a certificate as an intermediary or subordinate CA. What this means is that the entity that this certificate was issued to can now sign other certificates. And so, on building a chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each major OS vendor ships a large number of trusted root CA certificates with their OS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fields in the X.509 standard -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version, what version of the X.509 standard certificate adheres to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serial number, a unique identifier for their certificate assigned by the CA which allows the CA to manage and identify individual certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate Signature Algorithm, this field indicates what public key algorithm is used for the public key and what hashing algorithm is used to sign the certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issuer Name, this field contains information about the authority that signed the certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validity, this contains two subfields, Not Before and Not After, which define the dates when the certificate is valid for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject, this field contains identifying information about the entity the certificate was issued to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject Public Key Info, these two subfields define the algorithm of the public key along with the public key itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate Signature Value - the digital signature data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate fingerprints which aren&amp;rsquo;t actually fields in the certificate itself, but are computed by clients when validating or inspecting certificates. These are just hash digests of the whole certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Web of Trust -  Where individuals instead of certificate authorities sign other individuals&amp;rsquo; public keys. Before an individual signs a key, they should first verify the person&amp;rsquo;s identity through an agreed upon mechanism.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Signing Parties - Group of participants perform verification and signing.  At the end of the party everyone&amp;rsquo;s public key should have been signed by every other participant establishing a web of trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptography in Action
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Also called HTTP over SSL or TLS since it&amp;rsquo;s essentially encapsulating the HTTP traffic over an encrypted, secured channel utilizing SSL or TLS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL was deprecated in 2015, and TLS 1.2 is the current recommended revision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TLS is a generic protocol to permit secure communications and authentication over a network. TLS is also used to secure other communications aside from web browsing, like VoIP calls such as Skype or
Hangouts, email, instant messaging, and even Wi-Fi network security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TLS grants 3 things -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One, a secure communication line, which means data being transmitted is protected from potential eavesdroppers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two, the ability to authenticate both parties communicating, though typically, only the server is authenticated by the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And three, the integrity of communications, meaning there are checks to ensure that messages aren&amp;rsquo;t lost or altered in transit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ClientHello - Client includes information about the client, like the version of the TLS that the client supports, a list of cipher suites that it supports, and maybe some additional TLS options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ServerHello - Server selects the highest protocol version in common with the client, and chooses a cipher suite from the list to use. It also transmits its digital certificate and a final ServerHelloDone message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client Validation - The client will then validate the certificate that the server sent over to ensure that it&amp;rsquo;s trusted and it&amp;rsquo;s for the appropriate host name. Assuming the certificate checks out, the client then sends a ClientKeyExchange message. This is when the client chooses a key exchange mechanism to securely establish a shared secret with the server. It then sends ChangeCipherSpec message indicating that it&amp;rsquo;s switching to secure communications now. Followed by encrypted Finished message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server response - The server replies with a ChangeCipherSpec and an encrypted Finished message once the shared secret is received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH (Secure Shell) uses public key cryptography to authenticate the remote machine that the client is connecting to, and has provisions to allow user authentication via client certificates, if desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) - An encryption application that allows authentication of data along with privacy from third parties. Very secure. Has been compared to military grade encryption. Designed to use keys no smaller than 128 bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing Network Traffic
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A VPN is a mechanism that allows you to remotely connect a host or network to an internal private network, passing the data over a public channel, like the Internet. A sort of encrypted tunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPsec, or Internet Protocol Security, is a VPN protocol that was designed in conjunction with IPv6.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It works by encrypting an IP packet and encapsulating the encrypted packet inside an IPsec packet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This encrypted packet then gets routed to the VPN endpoint where the packet is de-encapsulated and decrypted then sent to the final destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPsec supports two modes of operations, transport mode and tunnel mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When transport mode is used, only the payload of the IP packet is encrypted, leaving the IP headers untouched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet, header, payload, and all, is encrypted and encapsulated inside a new IP packet with new headers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L2TP, or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, is a simple tunneling protocol that allows encapsulation of different protocols. The tunnel is provided by L2TP, secure channel is provided by Ipsec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L2TP IPsec (combination of L2TP and IPSec) was officially standardized in ietf RFC 3193&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenVPN uses the OpenSSL library to handle key exchange and encryption of data, along with control channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptographic Hardware
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trusted Platform Module or TPM - is a hardware device that&amp;rsquo;s typically integrated into the hardware of a computer, that&amp;rsquo;s a dedicated crypto processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPM offers secure generation of keys, random number generation, remote attestation, and data binding and sealing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure element. Similar to a TPM, it&amp;rsquo;s a tamper resistant chip often embedded in the microprocessor or integrated into the mainboard of a mobile device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Disk Encryption or FDE, is the practice of encrypting the entire drive in the system. E.g - Bitlocker from Microsoft, Filevault 2 from Apple, open source software dm-crypt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-3---aaa-security-not-roadside-assistance&#34;&gt;Week 3 - AAA Security (Not Roadside Assistance)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and describe the most common authentication services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand and be able to choose the most appropriate method of authentication or authorization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to grant the appropriate level of access for the users of an organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication Best Practices
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identification is the idea of describing an entity uniquely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication - to go about proving you are who you claim to be (AuthN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorization - pertains to the resources and identity has access to (AuthZ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good password policy system would enforce length requirements, character complexity, and check for the presence of dictionary words, which would undermine the strength of password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multifactor Authentication
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multifactor authentication is a system where users are authenticated by presenting multiple pieces of information (factors). 3 types of factors - Something you know, something you have, and something you are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something you know - password, pin, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something you have - physical token, card, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;something you are - retina scan, fingerprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical tokens - RSA securId token - It&amp;rsquo;s a small, battery-powered device with an LCD display, that shows a One-Time-Password that&amp;rsquo;s rotated periodically. The seed value is used in conjunction with the current time to generate a One-Time-Password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another common method is delivering OTP via sms to mobile phones. Issue - SMS isn&amp;rsquo;t encrypted, nor is it private. And it&amp;rsquo;s possible for SMS to be intercepted by a well-funded attacker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biometric - Biometric characteristics can be super difficult to change in the event that they are compromised unlike passwords. So usually hash of fingerprint is stored instead of the actual data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U2F or Universal Second Factor - U2F incorporates a challenge-response mechanism, along with public key cryptography to implement a more secure and more convenient second-factor authentication solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificates
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to issue client certificates, an organization must set up and maintain CA infrastructure to issue and sign certificates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP, or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, is an open industry-standard protocol for accessing and maintaining directory services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bind - how clients authenticate to the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StartTLS, which permits a client to communicate using LDAP v3 over TLS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unbind - closes connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RADIUS
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RADIUS or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service, is a protocol that provides AAA services for users on a network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a client wants to access a resource that&amp;rsquo;s protected, the client will present authentication credentials to a NAS or Network Access Server which will relay the credentials to the RADIUS server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the RADIUS server has evaluated the user authentication request, it replies with one of three messages access reject, access challenge or access accept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerberos
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that uses tickets to allow entities to prove their identity over potentially insecure channels to provide mutual authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerberos supports AES encryption, and implements checksums to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The authentication tickets let users authenticate to services without requiring username and password authentication for every service individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first message is the encrypted client to server ticket received from the Ticket Granting Service. The second is a new authenticator with the client ID and time stamp encrypted using the client-server session key. The SS decrypts the first message using its secret key which provides it with the client-server session key. The key is then used to decrypt the second message, and it compares the client ID in the authenticator to the one included in the client to server ticket. If these IDs match, then the SS sends a message containing the time stamp from the client supplied authenticator encrypted using the client-server session key. The client, then decrypts this message, and checks that the time stamp is correct authenticating the server. If this all succeeds, then the server grants access to the requested service on the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TACACS+
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TACACS+ (Terminal Access controller Access-Control System Plus) - Cisco developed AAA protocol that was released as an open standard in 1993. TACACS+ is primarily used for device administration, authentication, authorization, and accounting, as opposed to RADIUS, which is mostly used for network access AAA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single Sign-On
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSO (Single Sign-On) is accomplished by authenticating to a central authentication server, like an LDAP server. This then provides a cookie, or token that can be used to get access to applications configured to use SSO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerberos is actually a good example of an SSO authentication service. The user would authenticate against the Kerberos service once, which would then grant them a ticket granting ticket. This can then be presented to the ticket granting service in place of traditional credentials. So, the user can enter credentials once and gain access to a variety of services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;openID - centralized authentication system, is an open standard that allows participating sites known as Relying Parties to allow authentication of users utilizing a third party authentication service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorization and Access Control Methods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorization pertains to describing what the user account has access to or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have access to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kerberos - After user is authenticated and receives a TGT, it can be used to request access to a specific service by sending a request to Ticket-granting service (TGS). The TGS will decide whether or not the user in question is permitted to access the service being requested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access Control
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OAuth is an open standard that allows users to grant third-party websites and applications access to their information without sharing account credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User needs to confirm if they grant access or not. Once confirmed, the identity provider will supply the third party with a token that gives them access to the user&amp;rsquo;s information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The provider issues an access token which would have a scope to do specific things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OAuth is specifically an authorization system and OpenID is an authentication system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 designed to improve upon OpenID and build better integration with OAuth authorizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access Control List
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An access control list or ACL, is a way of defining permissions or authorizations for objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A file system would have an ACL, which is a table or database with a list of entries specifying access rights for individuals or groups for various objects on the file system like folders, files or programs. These individual access permissions per object are called Access Control Entries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network ACLs are used for restricting and controlling access to hosted services running on hosts within your network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking Usage and Access
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting - keeping records of what resources and services your users access or what they did when they were using your systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auditing - involves reviewing these records to ensure that nothing is out of the ordinary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TACACS+ server would be more concerned with keeping track of user authentication, what systems they authenticated to, and what commands they ran during their session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RADIUS will track details like session duration, client location and bandwidth, or other resources used during the session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-4---securing-your-networks&#34;&gt;Week 4 - Securing Your Networks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement security measures on a network environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the risks of wireless networks and how to mitigate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand how to monitor network traffic and read packet captures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure Network Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Hardening Best Practices
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network hardening is the process of securing a network by reducing its potential vulnerabilities through configuration changes, and taking specific steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General security principle - Disable unnecessary extra services or restrict access to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implicit deny - A network security concept where anything not explicitly permitted or allowed should be denied. Whitelist instead of blacklist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring &amp;amp; analyzing network traffic is important. Establish a baseline of what your typical network traffic looks like. Splunk is an example of a good tool to use to analyze logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correlation analysis is the process of taking log data from different systems, and matching events across the systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flood guards provide protection against DoS or denial of service attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network segmentation/separation, using VLANs to create virtual networks for different device classes or types, provides some security benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Hardware Hardening
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rogue DHCP server attack - Attacker manages to deploy a rogue DHCP server on your network, which hands out DHCP leases - setting up gateway address and gaining access to traffic to/from the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DHCP snooping - A switch that has DHCP snooping will monitor DHCP traffic being sent across it, will also track IP assignments and map them to hosts connected to switch ports. Also protects against IP spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARP man-in-the-middle attack - An attacker could forge an ARP response, advertising its MAC address as the physical address matching a victim&amp;rsquo;s IP address. When this happens, all of the clients on the local network segment would cache this ARP entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) - Another feature on enterprise switches that prevents ARP MIM attack. It requires the use of DHCP snooping to establish a trusted binding of IP addresses to switch ports. DAI will detect these forged gratuitous ARP packets and drop them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP source guard or IPSG - Can be enabled on enterprise switches along with DHCP snooping, to prevent IP spoofing attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.1X - IEEE standard for encapsulating EAP or Extensible Authentication Protocol traffic over the 802 networks. This is also called EAP over LAN or EAPOL, it was originally designed for Ethernet but support was added for other network types like Wi-Fi and fiber networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EAP-TLS - 3 parties involved.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supplicant - Client device/software on the client that handles the authentication. E.g. wpa_supplicant in linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authenticator - Enterprise switch/Access point - A mediator that forwards request to authentication server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication Server - Usually a RADIUS server where the  actual credential verification and authentication occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Software Hardening
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N/W Software hardening includes things like firewalls, proxies, VPNs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firewall - n/w based firewall or host-based firewall. Host-based in a must for portable devices like laptops. Usually both solutions are deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPNs provide secure remote access and link two networks securely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proxies can be really useful to protect client devices and their traffic. They also provide secure remote access without using a VPN. A proxy server can be configured to block content that might be malicious, dangerous, or just against company policy. A reverse proxy can be configured to allow secure remote access to web based services without requiring a VPN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WEP Encryption and Why You Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Use It
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy -  part of the original 802.11 standard introduced back in 1997. Was intended to provide privacy on par with the wired network, which means the information passed over
the network should be protected from third parties eavesdropping by having physical proximity to the access point or client station. They key idea was to provide encryption so that even if someone eavesdrops, they wouldn’t be able to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption key for each packet was computed by taking the user-supplied shared key and then joining a 24-bit initialization vector (IV).  The shared key was entered as either 10 hexadecimal characters for 40-bit WEP, or 26 hex characters for 104-bit WEP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main issue - WEP transmits both the plain text and the ciphertext in a way that exposes both of these messages to potential eavesdroppers.  When plaintext and ciphertext are sent together, attackers can work out the key used for encryption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one should be using WEP anymore it doesn’t provide the expected confidentiality or security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Get Rid of WEP! WPA/WPA2
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPA or Wi-Fi Protected Access - A short-term replacement for WEP that would be compatible with older WEP-enabled hardware with a simple firmware update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TKIP or the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol. Introduced to overcome shortcomings of WEP security. Uses RC4 cipher. Generates unique encryption keys per packet. It also utilizes 256 bit long keys. Introduced 3 new features -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1- A more secure key derivation method was used to securely incorporate the IV into the per packet encryption key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2- A sequence counter was implemented to prevent replay attacks by rejecting out of order packets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3- A 64-bit MIC or Message Integrity Check was introduced to prevent forging, tampering, or corruption of packets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wifi passphrase is not used to encrypt traffic. The passphrase is fed into the PBKDF2 or Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2, along with the Wi-Fi networks SSID as a salt. This is then run through the HMAC-SHA1 function 4096 times to generate a unique encryption key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPA2 improves WPA security even more by implementing CCMP or Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol. WPA2 is the best security for wireless networks currently available.  It&amp;rsquo;s based on the AES cipher. Has Four-Way Handshake, since it&amp;rsquo;s made up of four exchanges of data between the client and AP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPS - a convenience feature designed to make it easier for clients to join a WPA-PSK protected network. WPS simplifies sharing passphrases by allowing for secure exchange of the SSID and pre-shared key. This is done after authenticating or exchanging data using one of the four supported methods - PIN entry authentication, NFC or USB for out of banned exchange of the network details, or push-button authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireless Hardening
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though 802.1X with EAP-TLS is the most secure option, it may not be viable for small companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires the use of a RADIUSserver and an additional authentication back-end at a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If EAP-TLS is implemented, then all the public key infrastructure components will also be necessary. You have to securely deploy PKI on the back-end for certificate management,  a system must be in place to sign the client&amp;rsquo;s certificates, you have to distribute them to each client that would be authenticating to the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 802.1X is too complicated for a company, the next best alternative would be WPA2 with AES/CCMP mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sniffing the Network
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packet Sniffing or Packet Capture, is a process of intercepting network packets in their entirety for analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promiscuous mode - By default network interfaces accept and process packets that are for specific addresses. This can be overridden by configuring a special mode - Promiscuous mode which indicates &amp;ldquo;Give me all the packets.&amp;rdquo; Instead of only accepting and handling packets destined for its address, it will now accept and process any packet that it sees. This is much more useful for network analysis or monitoring purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port Mirroring, allows the switch to take all packets from a specified port, port range, or the entire VLAN and mirror the packets to a specified switch port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another option is to use Hubs. Hubs are a quick and dirty way of getting packets mirrored to your capture interface. Drawbacks - reduced throughput and the potential for introducing collisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor mode, allows us to scan across channels to see all wireless traffic being sent by APs and clients. To capture wireless traffic, all you need is an interface placed into monitor mode. Just like enabling promiscuous mode, this can be done with a simple command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireshark and tcpdump
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tcpdump is a super popular, lightweight command-line based utility that you can use to capture and analyze packets. Tcpdump uses the open source libpcap library. Also supports writing packet captures to a file for later analysis, sharing, or replaying traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It converts key information from layers three and up into human readable formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output of a sample tcpdump -
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1- Timestamp that represents when the packet on this line was processed by the kernel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2- Layer-3 protocol. E.g. IPv4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3- Connection quad -  source address, source port, destination address, and destination port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4- TCP flags, TCP sequence number if there are any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5- Ack number,TCP window size, then TCP options, if there are any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6- Payload size in bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireshark - another capture and analysis tool that has more features than tcpdump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a graphical utility that also uses the libpcap library for capture and interpretation of packets. It is more extensible when it comes to protocol and application analysis.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can decode encrypted payloads if the encryption key is known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can identify and extract data payloads from file transfers through protocols like SMB or HTTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDS/IPS systems look for matching behavior or characteristics that would indicate malicious traffic. IDS detects, IPS goes one level forward and prevents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can either be host based or network based.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIDS systems resemble firewalls in a lot of ways. But a firewall is designed to prevent intrusions by blocking potentially malicious traffic coming from outside, and enforce ACLs between networks. NIDS systems are meant to detect and alert on potential malicious activity coming from within the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some popular NID or NIP systems are Snort, Suricata, and Bro NIDS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-5---defense-in-depth&#34;&gt;Week 5 - Defense in Depth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the appropriate methods for system hardening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the appropriate methods for application hardening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the appropriate policies to use for operating system security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Hardening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro to Defense in Depth
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defense in depth is the concept of having multiple overlapping systems of defense to protect IT systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This ensures some amount of redundancy for defensive measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disabling Unnecessary Components
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attack vector is a method or mechanism by which an attacker or malware gains access to a network or system. Some attack vectors are email attachments, network protocols or services, network interfaces, and user input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Attack Surface is the sum of all the different attack vectors in a given system. Think of this as the combination of all possible ways an attacker could interact with our system, regardless of known vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The less complex something is, the less likely there will be undetected flaws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way to keep things simple is to reduce your software deployments. Instead of having five different software solutions to accomplish five separate tasks, replace them with one unified solution, if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host-Based Firewall
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host-based firewalls are important to creating multiple layers of security. They protect individual hosts from being compromised when they&amp;rsquo;re used in untrusted and potentially malicious environments. They also protect individual hosts from potentially compromised peers inside a trusted network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bastion hosts - exposed to the internet so you should pay special attention to hardening and locking them down to reduce the chances of compromise. A sort of gateway or access portal into more sensitive services like core authentication servers or domain controllers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging and Auditing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging is very crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A firewall would log traffic that matches rules with details like source and destination addresses, and ports being used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security information and event management systems or SIEMS - centralized logging server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some examples of logging servers and SIEMS solutions are the open source rsylog, Splunk Enterprise Security, IBM Security Qradar, and RSA Security analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antimalware Protection
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antivirus software is signature based. This means that it has a database of signatures that identify known malware like the unique file hash of a malicious binary or the file associated with an infection. Or it could be that network traffic characteristics that malware uses to communicate with a command and control server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two issues with antivirus software though. The first is that they depend on antivirus signatures distributed by the antivirus software vendor. The second is that they depend on the antivirus vendor discovering new malware and writing new signatures for newly discovered threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk Encryption
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full-disk encryption, or FDE, is an important factor in a defense in-depth security model. It provides protection from some physical forms of attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are first-party full-disk encryption solutions from Microsoft and Apple called Bit Locker and FileVault 2 respectively. There are also a bunch of third party and open source solutions. On Linux, the dm-crypt package is super popular. There are also solutions from PGP, TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt, and lots of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Hardening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Patch Management
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of attacks depend on exploiting bugs in software. This triggers obscure and unintended behavior which can lead to a compromise of the system running the vulnerable software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be fixed through software patches and updates which correct the bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solutions like Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s SCCM or Puppet Labs puppet in fact and tools allow administrators to get an overview of what software is installed across their fleet of many systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application Policies
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application software can represent a pretty large attack surface. So it is important to have some kind of application policies in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policies define boundaries of what applications are permitted or not, they also help educate folks on how to use software more securely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;week-6---creating-a-company-culture-for-security&#34;&gt;Week 6 - Creating a Company Culture for Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine appropriate measures to use to meet the 3 goals of security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a security plan for a small-medium size organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a disaster recovery plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk in the Workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Goals
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you start to design a security architecture, you need to define exactly what you like it to accomplish, which differs from company to company. If the company handles credit card payments, then you have to follow the PCI DSS or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard depending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 broad objectives of PCI DSS (An area that I&amp;rsquo;m super familiar with!)
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain a secure network and systems
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not use vendor supply default for system passwords/other parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect cardholder data
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect stored cardholder data - encrypt data at rest, have data retention policies to make sure that sensitive payment information isn&amp;rsquo;t stored beyond the time it&amp;rsquo;s required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt the transmission of cardholder data across open public networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a vulnerability management program
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect all systems against malware and regularly update antivirus software or programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain secure systems and applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement strong access control measures
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and authenticate access to system components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict physical access to cardholder data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly monitor and test networks
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly test security systems and processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain an information security policy
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel (security team + users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measuring and Assessing Risk
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security is about determining risks and understanding the likelihood of attacks; and designing defenses around these risks to minimize the impact of an attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threat modeling - Identify likely threats to our systems, then we assign them priorities that correspond to severity and probability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Habits
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One needs to set up users for success so that they don&amp;rsquo;t develop habits that might prove harmful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For e.g. If long and complex passwords are enforced as a rule, users might end up writing them on a post-it to remember and that defeats the purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If sharing big files is a common behavior, there needs to be a solution for that within the company so that users don’t end up using a 3rd party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password reuse is another common user behavior and one needs to encourage users to choose unique passwords for different systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third-Party Security
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you contract services from a third party, you&amp;rsquo;re trusting them to protect your data and any credentials involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct a vendor risk review or security assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, ask the third party security assessment report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google recently made their vendor security assessment questionnaires available for free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Training
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to have good security practices at your company if employees and users haven&amp;rsquo;t received good trainings and resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident Handling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incident Reporting and Analysis
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The very first step of handling an incident is to detect it in the first place. It could be through IDS system or some other alerting. Or someone bringing to your notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next step is to analyze it and determine the effects and scope of damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next step is containment. You need to contain the breach to prevent further damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incident Response and Recovery
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a threat has been detected and contained, it has to be removed or remediated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For malware infection, this means removing the malware from affected systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many other cases, removal may not be possible, the affected system might have to be restored to a known good configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is crucial to avoid complications or to not add to the problem. Sometimes shutdown works but many times, it could cause more damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile Security and Privacy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the most basic protections you can enable on a smartphone or tablet is a screen lock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable storage encryption on the device if it is not default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch what permission is given to each app on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement by Eliyahu M. Goldratt &amp; Jeff Cox</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-09-the-goal-goldratt/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-09-the-goal-goldratt/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-09-the-goal-goldratt/ -&lt;p&gt;The book is about Alex, a plant manager who is in the middle of a very difficult situation. Everything seems to be falling apart. Shipments are always late, backlog is growing, factory is bleeding money though every single person is working hard all the time. The VP comes to the factory and asks about an order that is seven-weeks overdue. He goes into the factory floor and asks folks to stop everything and work on the order that he wants to be done. He yells at the machinist and he quits. The VP tells the manager that the order has to go out today no matter the cost. Also that the factory is running so badly that it will be shut down in 3 months. The manager goes on the floor and finds out that the machinist who quit earlier, is crucial to get the work done fast! To add to all this, his wife is completely upset with him since he is mostly at office and does not give enough time to the family. Tonight he was supposed to take his wife out and it turns out to be an allnighter to deliver an order that VP has asked for. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone thinks that this is a far fetched scenario, I assure you that it is not. It is a day-to-day reality at most of the tech companies, especially the ones on the cutting edge, not to mention Startups. As someone who worked at online companies for the last 15 years, close to a decade at ebay and six years at PayPal, this situation is all too familiar to me. Of course, it depends on the team and role but an online company is 24/7 and unanticipated issues can happen anytime. With SRE on your back and a lot of people asking questions, you could hear the collective heartbeat of the executive team and also
the sound of money going down the drain, when there is a production P0 at hand. Impacting the livelihood of merchants is another thing that would spring you to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the story is not a sombre one. Alex, the plant manager is able to get out of the trouble. He makes a remarkable turnaround and posts profits every month and delivers orders ahead of time. He also wins back the love of his wife and gets time to spend with his kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because he gets a chance to present his problem to his professor in the past and the professor, a wise man, asks a series of great questions. The questions get Alex thinking and he finds solutions by working with his team. The key inputs are the questions raised by the &amp;lsquo;Yoda&amp;rsquo; professor, Jonah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one is close to the &amp;lsquo;factory&amp;rsquo;, one tends to dismiss theoretical scientists as moutain-top hermits who are not close to code and don&amp;rsquo;t know the realities. But the book proves that for critical thinking, one doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be working at the lathe, one could as well be outside and observe the workings to analyze what is wrong. This is what Jonah does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway from the book was that one needs to be clear about what the Goal is. The goal of a company is to make money. Increase throughput, reduce inventory and reduce the operation expenses. Look at the whole operation and find out bottlenecks, reduce bottlenecks to improve throughput. The key thing is to sell quality products which could translate in software terms to &amp;lsquo;ship code&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning makes all the difference. The team is able to deliver a sudden order of 1000 parts without overworking or spending time in the weekends because they do things in a methodical manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is a great book and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad that someone recommended this to me. For new managers, it might help them be better managers, for existing managers who are finding it tough to juggle all the balls in the air, it would offer hope - to think, to look for new solutions, and be optimistic. The best thing is, it is a business book that is written as a story, a thriller, where you&amp;rsquo;re turning the next page to find out what happened!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Favorite Poems</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-08-favorite-poems/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-08-favorite-poems/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-08-favorite-poems/ -&lt;p&gt;In the post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/blog/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/&#34;&gt;my reading journey&lt;/a&gt;, I had mentioned a few poems that were my favorite. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d just put them all here. One place to come back to read them over and again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-arrow-and-the-song&#34;&gt;The Arrow and the Song&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shot an arrow into the air,&lt;br&gt;
It fell to earth, I knew not where;&lt;br&gt;
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight&lt;br&gt;
Could not follow it in its flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I breathed a song into the air,&lt;br&gt;
It fell to earth, I knew not where;&lt;br&gt;
For who has sight so keen and strong,&lt;br&gt;
That it can follow the flight of song?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long, long afterward, in an oak&lt;br&gt;
I found the arrow, still unbroke;&lt;br&gt;
And the song, from beginning to end,&lt;br&gt;
I found again in the heart of a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    &amp;mdash;
    
      &lt;a class=&#34;author&#34; href=&#34;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44624/the-arrow-and-the-song&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    

    
      The Arrow and the Song&lt;/a&gt; by
    

    
      &lt;span class=&#34;author&#34;&gt; H W Longfellow&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other favorite Longfellow poems - &lt;strong&gt;A Psalm of Life&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us, Footprints on the sands of time;&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;The Day is Done&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Then read from the treasured volume, The poem of thy choice, &amp;hellip; And the cares, that infest the day &amp;hellip; Shall fold their tents &amp;hellip; And as silently steal away&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hope&amp;rdquo; is the thing with feathers&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hope&amp;rdquo; is the thing with feathers&lt;br&gt;
That perches in the soul&lt;br&gt;
And sings the tune without the words&lt;br&gt;
And never stops - at all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard&lt;br&gt;
And sore must be the storm&lt;br&gt;
That could abash the little Bird&lt;br&gt;
That kept so many warm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard it in the chillest land&lt;br&gt;
And on the strangest Sea&lt;br&gt;
Yet - never - in Extremity,&lt;br&gt;
It asked a crumb - of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    &amp;mdash;
    
      &lt;a class=&#34;author&#34; href=&#34;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    

    
      &amp;#39;Hope&amp;#39; is the thing with feathers&lt;/a&gt; by
    

    
      &lt;span class=&#34;author&#34;&gt; Emily Dickinson&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other favorite Emily Dickinson poems - &lt;strong&gt;Success is counted sweetest&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;By those who ne&amp;rsquo;er succeed.&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;Tell all the truth but tell it slant&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Truth must dazzle gradually, Or every man be blind&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ithaca&#34;&gt;Ithaca&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you set out for Ithaka&lt;br&gt;
hope your road is a long one,&lt;br&gt;
full of adventure, full of discovery.&lt;br&gt;
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,&lt;br&gt;
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:&lt;br&gt;
you’ll never find things like that on your way&lt;br&gt;
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,&lt;br&gt;
as long as a rare excitement&lt;br&gt;
stirs your spirit and your body.&lt;br&gt;
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,&lt;br&gt;
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them&lt;br&gt;
unless you bring them along inside your soul,&lt;br&gt;
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope your road is a long one.&lt;br&gt;
May there be many summer mornings when,&lt;br&gt;
with what pleasure, what joy,&lt;br&gt;
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;&lt;br&gt;
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations&lt;br&gt;
to buy fine things,&lt;br&gt;
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,&lt;br&gt;
sensual perfume of every kind—&lt;br&gt;
as many sensual perfumes as you can;&lt;br&gt;
and may you visit many Egyptian cities&lt;br&gt;
to learn and go on learning from their scholars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep Ithaka always in your mind.&lt;br&gt;
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.&lt;br&gt;
But don’t hurry the journey at all.&lt;br&gt;
Better if it lasts for years,&lt;br&gt;
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,&lt;br&gt;
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,&lt;br&gt;
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.&lt;br&gt;
Without her you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have set out.&lt;br&gt;
She has nothing left to give you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.&lt;br&gt;
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,&lt;br&gt;
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    &amp;mdash;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-road-not-taken&#34;&gt;The Road Not Taken&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,&lt;br&gt;
And sorry I could not travel both&lt;br&gt;
And be one traveler, long I stood&lt;br&gt;
And looked down one as far as I could&lt;br&gt;
To where it bent in the undergrowth;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then took the other, as just as fair,&lt;br&gt;
And having perhaps the better claim,&lt;br&gt;
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;&lt;br&gt;
Though as for that the passing there&lt;br&gt;
Had worn them really about the same,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And both that morning equally lay&lt;br&gt;
In leaves no step had trodden black.&lt;br&gt;
Oh, I kept the first for another day!&lt;br&gt;
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,&lt;br&gt;
I doubted if I should ever come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall be telling this with a sigh&lt;br&gt;
Somewhere ages and ages hence:&lt;br&gt;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -&lt;br&gt;
I took the one less traveled by,&lt;br&gt;
And that has made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
    &amp;mdash;

      The Road Not Taken&lt;/a&gt; by
    

    
      &lt;span class=&#34;author&#34;&gt; Robert Frost&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other poems by Robert Frost that I liked - &lt;strong&gt;Stopping by the woods on a Snowy Evening&lt;/strong&gt; (has the famous lines &lt;em&gt;I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep&lt;/em&gt;),  &lt;strong&gt;Mending Wall&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Good fences make good neighbors&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;Fire and Ice&lt;/strong&gt; (Inspiration for George RR Martin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://yabookreviewer.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-reveals-winds-of-winter-details-and-more/&#34;&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if&#34;&gt;If&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can keep your head when all about you&lt;br&gt;
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  &lt;br&gt;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,&lt;br&gt;
But make allowance for their doubting too;  &lt;br&gt;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,&lt;br&gt;
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,&lt;br&gt;
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,&lt;br&gt;
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  &lt;br&gt;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  &lt;br&gt;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster&lt;br&gt;
And treat those two impostors just the same;  &lt;br&gt;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken&lt;br&gt;
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,&lt;br&gt;
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,&lt;br&gt;
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can make one heap of all your winnings&lt;br&gt;
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,&lt;br&gt;
And lose, and start again at your beginnings&lt;br&gt;
And never breathe a word about your loss;&lt;br&gt;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew&lt;br&gt;
To serve your turn long after they are gone, &lt;br&gt;
And so hold on when there is nothing in you&lt;br&gt;
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  &lt;br&gt;
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,&lt;br&gt;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,&lt;br&gt;
If all men count with you, but none too much;&lt;br&gt;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute&lt;br&gt;
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  &lt;br&gt;
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,&lt;br&gt;
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the night that covers me,&lt;br&gt;
Black as the pit from pole to pole,&lt;br&gt;
I thank whatever gods may be&lt;br&gt;
For my unconquerable soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fell clutch of circumstance&lt;br&gt;
I have not winced nor cried aloud.&lt;br&gt;
Under the bludgeonings of chance&lt;br&gt;
My head is bloody, but unbowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this place of wrath and tears&lt;br&gt;
Looms but the Horror of the shade,&lt;br&gt;
And yet the menace of the years&lt;br&gt;
Finds and shall find me unafraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It matters not how strait the gate,&lt;br&gt;
How charged with punishments the scroll,&lt;br&gt;
I am the master of my fate,&lt;br&gt;
I am the captain of my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.&lt;br&gt;
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height&lt;br&gt;
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight&lt;br&gt;
For the ends of being and ideal grace.&lt;br&gt;
I love thee to the level of every day’s&lt;br&gt;
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.&lt;br&gt;
I love thee freely, as men strive for right;\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.&lt;br&gt;
I love thee with the passion put to use&lt;br&gt;
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.&lt;br&gt;
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose&lt;br&gt;
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,&lt;br&gt;
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,&lt;br&gt;
I shall but love thee better after death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was angry with my friend;&lt;br&gt;
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.&lt;br&gt;
I was angry with my foe:&lt;br&gt;
I told it not, my wrath did grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I waterd it in fears,&lt;br&gt;
Night &amp;amp; morning with my tears:&lt;br&gt;
And I sunned it with smiles,&lt;br&gt;
And with soft deceitful wiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it grew both day and night.&lt;br&gt;
Till it bore an apple bright.&lt;br&gt;
And my foe beheld it shine,&lt;br&gt;
And he knew that it was mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And into my garden stole,&lt;br&gt;
When the night had veild the pole;&lt;br&gt;
In the morning glad I see;&lt;br&gt;
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wandered lonely as a cloud&lt;br&gt;
That floats on high o&amp;rsquo;er vales and hills,&lt;br&gt;
When all at once I saw a crowd,&lt;br&gt;
A host, of golden daffodils;&lt;br&gt;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,&lt;br&gt;
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous as the stars that shine&lt;br&gt;
And twinkle on the milky way,&lt;br&gt;
They stretched in never-ending line&lt;br&gt;
Along the margin of a bay:&lt;br&gt;
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,&lt;br&gt;
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waves beside them danced; but they&lt;br&gt;
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:&lt;br&gt;
A poet could not but be gay,&lt;br&gt;
In such a jocund company:&lt;br&gt;
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought&lt;br&gt;
What wealth the show to me had brought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For oft, when on my couch I lie&lt;br&gt;
In vacant or in pensive mood,&lt;br&gt;
They flash upon that inward eye&lt;br&gt;
Which is the bliss of solitude;&lt;br&gt;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,&lt;br&gt;
And dances with the daffodils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,&lt;br&gt;
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;&lt;br&gt;
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,&lt;br&gt;
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,&lt;br&gt;
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;&lt;br&gt;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,&lt;br&gt;
And evening full of the linnet’s wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will arise and go now, for always night and day&lt;br&gt;
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;&lt;br&gt;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,&lt;br&gt;
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me not to the marriage of true minds&lt;br&gt;
Admit impediments. Love is not love&lt;br&gt;
Which alters when it alteration finds,&lt;br&gt;
Or bends with the remover to remove.&lt;br&gt;
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark&lt;br&gt;
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;&lt;br&gt;
It is the star to every wand&amp;rsquo;ring bark,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose worth&amp;rsquo;s unknown, although his height be taken.&lt;br&gt;
Love&amp;rsquo;s not Time&amp;rsquo;s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks&lt;br&gt;
Within his bending sickle&amp;rsquo;s compass come;&lt;br&gt;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,&lt;br&gt;
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.&lt;br&gt;
If this be error and upon me prov&amp;rsquo;d,&lt;br&gt;
I never writ, nor no man ever lov&amp;rsquo;d.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;No man is an island,&lt;br&gt;
Entire of itself,&lt;br&gt;
Every man is a piece of the continent,&lt;br&gt;
A part of the main.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a clod be washed away by the sea,&lt;br&gt;
Europe is the less.&lt;br&gt;
As well as if a promontory were.&lt;br&gt;
As well as if a manor of thy friend&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br&gt;
Or of thine own were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any man&amp;rsquo;s death diminishes me,&lt;br&gt;
Because I am involved in mankind,&lt;br&gt;
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;&lt;br&gt;
It tolls for thee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does a part of the world leave the world?&lt;br&gt;
How does wetness leave water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont&amp;rsquo; try to put out fire by throwing on&lt;br&gt;
more fire! Don&amp;rsquo;t wash a wound with blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how fast you run, your shadow&lt;br&gt;
keeps up. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s in front!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only full overhead sun diminishes your shadow.&lt;br&gt;
But that shadow has been serving you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What hurts you, blesses you. Darkness is&lt;br&gt;
your candle. Your boundaries are your quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could explain this, but it will break the&lt;br&gt;
glass cover on your heart, and there&amp;rsquo;s no fixing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have shadow and light source both.&lt;br&gt;
Listen, and lay your head under the tree of awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When from that tree feathers and wings sprout on you,&lt;br&gt;
be quieter than a dove. Don&amp;rsquo;t even open your mouth for even a coo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;blockquote_attr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching.&lt;br&gt;
And he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No man can reveal to you aught&lt;br&gt;
but that which already lies&lt;br&gt;
half asleep in the dawning&lt;br&gt;
of your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple,&lt;br&gt;
among his followers,&lt;br&gt;
gives not of his wisdom&lt;br&gt;
but rather of his faith and his lovingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he is indeed wise he does not bid&lt;br&gt;
you enter the house of his wisdom,&lt;br&gt;
but rather leads you&lt;br&gt;
to the threshold of your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astronomer may speak to you&lt;br&gt;
of his understanding of space,&lt;br&gt;
but he cannot give you&lt;br&gt;
his understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The musician may sing to you&lt;br&gt;
of the rhythm which is in all space,&lt;br&gt;
but he cannot give you the ear which arrests&lt;br&gt;
the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he who is versed in the science of numbers&lt;br&gt;
can tell of the regions of weight and measure,&lt;br&gt;
but he cannot conduct&lt;br&gt;
you thither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the vision of one man lends not&lt;br&gt;
its wings to another man.&lt;br&gt;
And even as each one of you stands&lt;br&gt;
alone in God’s knowledge,&lt;br&gt;
so must each one of you be&lt;br&gt;
alone in his knowledge of God&lt;br&gt;
and in his understanding of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Like a Psalm - Remembering Dostoyevsky</title>
        <link>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-07-like-a-psalm/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-07-like-a-psalm/</guid>
        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-07-like-a-psalm/ -&lt;p&gt;While I was walking down the &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/blog/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/&#34;&gt;memory lane&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, I remembered meeting RR in Chennai and his gift of &lt;strong&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Fyodor Dostoyevsky&lt;/strong&gt;. We were best friends in school and I had lost touch with him during engineering. One day there was an email and he said he was in Chennai. We agreed to meet. It was either a Saturday or a Sunday. I used to teach Math for CAT students during the weekends. I had finished a class and met RR at Landmark (book shop) in a mall. It probably was Spencer&amp;rsquo;s but not fully sure. He gifted me this book and it was a great surprise. He used to give greeting cards in the past with some inspiring and soulful words written beautifully. Expecting him to have written something, I opened the book to find a quote among other wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Obstacles are things you see when you take your eyes off the goal.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; ~ Henry Ford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I think of it, Dostoyevsky was an author who I wanted to read but hadn&amp;rsquo;t read. My first introduction to Dostoyevsky happened probably during high school/PU days. Through a book named &lt;strong&gt;Oru Sangeerthanam Pole&lt;/strong&gt; (Like a Psalm) by &lt;strong&gt;Perumbadavam&lt;/strong&gt;. I think I read the book from Viveknagar library. The author called Dostoyevsky as &lt;em&gt;Hridayathinu mel dhaivathinte kayyoppulla aal&lt;/em&gt; (A man who has God&amp;rsquo;s signature on his heart).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to visit Viveknagar library often. It was a small government library which was close to the bus stand. It used to open in the morning, close in the afternoon and open in the evening around 5. Many times, I used to wait for the libarian to come. There were few other people also waiting, usually to read newspaper or magazines. Since it was a govt library, there were books in all languages - many in Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, etc. I had read most of the English books that were available. Moreover our school had a bigger library with lot more choices. There was a small section of Malayalam books - probably around 20-30 books. I&amp;rsquo;d read a few of them in the library. &lt;strong&gt;Kanam&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Parappurath&lt;/strong&gt; are two authors I remember. I had heard of Dostoyevsky for the first time from one of the books I read during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oru Sangeerthanam Pole&lt;/strong&gt; is about Dostoyevsky&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Anna, his stenographer. It describes him as a person anyone would hate. He was a drunkard, gambler, lonely and depressed. He has a deadline to write a novel but had not started even a single page. I was thinking that someone like him may not make it anywhere in India. The society, in general is very intolerant of people who drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between Russia and Kerala itself is something to think about. How did Communism make its way to Kerala? How is there a Communist party which is Leninist. Saw a movie couple of years back called &lt;strong&gt;Comrade In America (CIA)&lt;/strong&gt; where the protagonist has a chat with Che Guvera, Marx and Lenin during a difficult time. Anyway, the Russia connection is something to read about for a later time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I need to read &lt;strong&gt;Oru Sangeerthanam Pole&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/strong&gt; again. Last year I read a book named &lt;strong&gt;12 Rules for Life&lt;/strong&gt; by Jordan Peterson. Peterson refers to Dostoyevsky multiple times in his book. Of course, he talks more about Solzhenitsyn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Gulag Archipelago&lt;/strong&gt; but he was a big fan of Dostoyevsky and urges us to read his books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo of the quote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Reading Journey</title>

        <description>Rob&#39;s Notes https://robinsonraju.info/posts/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/ -&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
~ Emerson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a dream about me being in Chennai and being asked about a book that I was reading. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember who it was, but it was someone happy to see me with a book. That set me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is great to be in this phase of life where I&amp;rsquo;m getting time to read and also, write a bit. I hope it lasts. Usually, when things are running smoothly, something happens that throws everything upside down and before long, years would have passed by. Anyway, it feels good to sit back and reminisce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chennai-days&#34;&gt;Chennai Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Chennai for less than two years in my life, but from a reading standpoint, it was a tremendous period. Was lucky to be in the same team with 4 people I now refer to as &amp;ldquo;the philosopher quartet&amp;rdquo; - JC, MS, AH, and VS. They were well-read and used to discuss books often. VS was a real poet who penned poems in Tamil. Was introduced to Kant, Nietzsche, J Krishnamoorthi, Bertrand Russel, and many authors during this period just by listening to them chat with each other. I believe that it was a stroke of luck that I was even placed in that team as my first job. Specific books that I recall right now are &lt;strong&gt;Robert Persig&amp;rsquo;s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hemingway&amp;rsquo;s Old Man and the Sea&lt;/strong&gt; recommended by MS, &lt;strong&gt;Arthur C Clark&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;Isaac Asimov&lt;/strong&gt; novels by AH and &lt;strong&gt;Who moved my Cheese&lt;/strong&gt; and a few other business books by JC. AH gave me &lt;strong&gt;Arthur C. Clark&amp;rsquo;s Rama II&lt;/strong&gt; as a gift when I left Chennai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other groups of friends were folks outside my team - few people who were in my class during the 3 month orientation where we were given a crash course of CS topics, my roommates, and friends of these people. I developed great admiration for people from TKM and CUSAT (engg colleges in Kerala) due to the interaction with these folks. PS was in my class and was a big &lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/strong&gt; fan. She had forwarded a pdf/text of the first book, and I had liked the book a lot. AN was my junior and was from Bangalore. As Bangaloreans were &amp;lsquo;foreigners&amp;rsquo; in Chennai, I used to connect with b&amp;rsquo;lore folks just to chat. He was a big fan of &lt;strong&gt;The Lord of The Rings&lt;/strong&gt;. When we used to meet in the hallways of Elnet/Tidel, he would talk at length about the story and it was pretty entertaining. I&amp;rsquo;d credit PS and AN for my interest in fantasy novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great influence on my reading during that time was DT. She was PS&amp;rsquo;s friend and also was in my roommate RV&amp;rsquo;s team, I think. She was a great fan of English classics. I think I read most of &lt;strong&gt;Thomas Hardy&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; novels during this period: &lt;strong&gt;The Return of the Native, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Far from the Madding Crowd, Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Under the Greenwood Tree&lt;/strong&gt;. Also remember reading &lt;strong&gt;George Eliot&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;The Mill on the Floss&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;Silas Marner&lt;/strong&gt;. I think I read &lt;strong&gt;Adam Bede&lt;/strong&gt; after I came to the US. Her favorite books were &lt;strong&gt;Louisa May Alcott&amp;rsquo;s Little Women&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Three Men in a boat&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Jerome K Jerome&lt;/strong&gt;. She introduced me to &lt;strong&gt;Somerset Maugham&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;AJ Cronin&lt;/strong&gt;. Maugham&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Of Human Bondage&lt;/strong&gt; and Cronin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;The Keys of the Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt; were great reads. I read &lt;strong&gt;Keys of the Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt; at a time when I was contemplating becoming a priest.  My goal was to work for a few years, get some personal things taken care of, and get into seminary. I did research a few places but wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to get into. Also was waiting for a &amp;lsquo;sign&amp;rsquo; that never came! &lt;strong&gt;Erich Segal&amp;rsquo;s Doctors&lt;/strong&gt; was another of DTs recommendations. &lt;strong&gt;Dan Brown&amp;rsquo;s The Da Vinci Code&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Leon Uris&lt;/strong&gt; were my roommate RV&amp;rsquo;s recommendations. VV was another close friend of mine and he was a big fan of Thoreau. He used to speak at length about &lt;strong&gt;Walden&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at the outset, it seems like I read only the books from people&amp;rsquo;s recommendations. That is true for the first books of many authors. But usually ended up reading more from the same authors and also did pay it forward by recommending the same with new folks that I met along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I think of it, I probably could go back to my earliest memories to see what I read when. Most of the books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read have some person or incident attached to it. It is the question of remembering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;primary-school&#34;&gt;Primary School&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first novels I remember reading is &lt;strong&gt;The Great Expectations&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Charles Dickens&lt;/strong&gt;. I got this book as a prize for getting the first rank in 5th std. I remember reading the whole book but not understanding it much. I probably read a few times without understanding, I think. I actually understood the story only after I read an abridged version. Another book that I remember reading during that time is &lt;strong&gt;Oliver Twist&lt;/strong&gt;. My mother probably had to study some of Dickens&amp;rsquo; stories in school. She had a high regard for Dickens and her advise was that I stick to reading only biographies or stories by Dickens, and so wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite happy that I was reading a lot of fiction in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do remember reading a lot of &lt;strong&gt;Tinkle&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Amar Chitra Katha&lt;/strong&gt; during this time. Probably got them from Krishna or Joe or other friends in the neighborhood. Read &lt;strong&gt;Balarama&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Balamangalam&lt;/strong&gt;, mostly with Biju. My uncle had a lot of books in Kerala, and when we visited during summer holidays, I used to spend a lot of time reading. Remember reading &lt;strong&gt;Ithihyamala&lt;/strong&gt; (Garland of legends/myths), &lt;strong&gt;Greek Purana Kathasagaram&lt;/strong&gt; (Greek Ancient Stories), and &lt;strong&gt;1001 Arabian Nights&lt;/strong&gt;. Got really interested in mythology - Indian as well as Greek during this time. Almost all of my mythology reading, in the initial days, were in Malayalam. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe that I read the stories of Zeus, Ulysses, Achilles, etc. first time in Malayalam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group of my readings during primary &amp;amp; high school days were novels from Malayala Manorama weekly. Used to read it stealthily most of the time, though. &lt;strong&gt;Josy Vagamattom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Joisy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ettumanoor Sivakumar&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Kottayam Pushpanath&lt;/strong&gt; were my favorite authors. At least the ones that I remember now after 20 odd years. It used to be serialized, in which only a part of the story would be published every week and most of them always ended on a cliff-hanger at the end. One was left waiting for next Wednesday to come! Josy Vagamattom wrote thrillers which had many fights - I remember &lt;strong&gt;Dravidan&lt;/strong&gt; and a hero named Noble. Not sure if Noble was the hero in Dravidan or it was someone else. Joisy wrote poignant family dramas - I remember &lt;strong&gt;Ila pozhiyum shishiram&lt;/strong&gt; in which a man comes back home from Gulf war after 5 years in captivity and finds that his wife had married his best friend. Ettumanoor Sivakumar was a writer of horror stories that had manthravadam (magic), yakshi (lady vampire), powerful munis and what not! Kottayam Pushpanath wrote detective stories that had a lot of twist and turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-school&#34;&gt;High School&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school was a different world than what I was exposed to till that point. Most kids were reading Hardy Boys, Secret Seven, Asterix, and a few other books and comics that I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of. In terms of reading volume, I probably read the maximum during that time. Definitely more than 250 books. Just the &lt;strong&gt;Hardy Boys&lt;/strong&gt; books were probably over 50, may be 100. Read most books of &lt;strong&gt;Agatha Christie, Jeffrey Archer, Sidney Sheldon, Robert Ludlum, Harold Robbins, Alistair MacLean, Jack Higgins, Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason)&lt;/strong&gt; and so on. I think I was mostly reading Hardy boys in the 8th std. and suddenly jumped to reading &lt;strong&gt;Wilbur Smith, Harold Robbins, Jack Higgins,&lt;/strong&gt; etc. in the 9th. Sometimes I read a book a day and rushed through them so fast that I barely remembered anything other than the main plot points. We were also going through a tough time personally and the books were probably a good escape too. All the reading meant that I didn&amp;rsquo;t study as much as I did during primary school. From someone who used to be upset with anything less than 100/100 in primary school and used to check with my teachers when I got less marks, even half a percent less, I became ok with just getting 90% in high school. But it was also a good transition from memorizing every single word in a text book to understanding high level ideas from books. &lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Archer&amp;rsquo;s Kane and Abel, Sydney Sheldon&amp;rsquo;s Rage of Angels, Alistair MacLean&amp;rsquo;s Guns of Navarone, Robert Ludlum&amp;rsquo;s Bourne series&lt;/strong&gt;, were some of the best page turners that I&amp;rsquo;ve read, then and now. The idea of starting with one of an author and reading through all of his/her books came during this time, I think. The kids in school used to keep tabs on who had read every single book of Jeffrey Archer or Robert Ludlum or similar authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;engineering&#34;&gt;Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of Engineering days, one book that stands out is &lt;strong&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Ayn Rand&lt;/strong&gt;. I can&amp;rsquo;t recollect how I got the book. It was most probably from Viveknagar library. The curious thing is that the cover and the first couple of pages were not there. The torn book started with &amp;lsquo;Part 1 - Non-Contradiction&amp;rsquo; and I thought the name of the book was &amp;lsquo;Non-Contradiction&amp;rsquo;! As I was studying during the day and taking tuitions for neighborhood kids in the evening and doing homework in the night. So there was not much time to read, but somehow did manage to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did read many English Classics during the time. Became a member of British Library with RA&amp;rsquo;s help and we used to visit the library many times. Re-read a few &lt;strong&gt;Agatha Christie&lt;/strong&gt; books, a few &lt;strong&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/strong&gt; books (not the plays but abridged versions which were written as stories). Discovered &lt;strong&gt;Antony Trollope&lt;/strong&gt; while randomly surfing through books. I read a few of his books, but don&amp;rsquo;t remember any at the moment. I&amp;rsquo;d read &lt;strong&gt;A Tale of Two Cities&lt;/strong&gt; in the past but read that again and found it to be the best book I&amp;rsquo;d ever read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also used to visit the Central library in Cubbon Park during those days. It was very close to UVCE and was the biggest library I had seen in my life. It probably is the largest library in the State even now. I was awestruck with the size every time I visited it. We had a very good library in the College but this was something else. Used to bunk some classes and sit in the library. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t (probably even now) very good at being an audience. Every time I&amp;rsquo;m in a hall or a room listening to someone talking on a stage, I would doze of in a few minutes. Happened during most of the classes except for those where we had to do something. So, I was studying everything on my own, anyway. Remember reading books on Kerala history from the library. Didn&amp;rsquo;t know that Malayalam was a young language and evolved as a result of combination of Tamil and Sanskrit. Also read more about our Church history, Christianity in Kerala, etc. Got a better understanding of Orthodoxy and the beginning of Christianity in Kerala in 52 AD when St. Thomas came. I think the average Orthodox Christian in Kerala knows history quite well due to our faction fight with the Syrian Patriarch. The &amp;lsquo;freedom&amp;rsquo; fight has resulted in more awareness, otherwise, numbers could have gone down in every generation, with more of the diaspora moving on to new philosophies or identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/strong&gt; by Stephen Hawking was a book that SN had read and I read it based on his recommendation. We used to have a lot of chat around space time and our place in the world itself. He was a follower of Ramanujacharya&amp;rsquo;s Dwaita philosophy. There are definitely many more books that I don&amp;rsquo;t recollect right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-days---india&#34;&gt;Working Days - India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CTS recruited us from Campus during 5th semester, there was a hope that the Bangalore office would become big enough. But 9-11 struck and we had to go to Chennai. Couple of years of work in Chennai and then a year or so in Bangalore were great in terms of reading. I already mentioned about Chennai days above. When I rewrite this piece, I&amp;rsquo;d probably write it in a chronological order. In B&amp;rsquo;lore, I read a few business and leadership books recommended by AN who was from IIM-A and was super wise. I was lucky that he was sitting next to me since he was not even in our team. AN and GG used to solve the crossword puzzle on the Hindu every day morning. I remember not being able to solve even one in the initial days and then slowly getting a hang of it and really loving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-days---us&#34;&gt;Working Days - US&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my time in the US has been this &lt;em&gt;cloud of time&lt;/em&gt; where I did nothing other than work. Get up in the morning and immediately check if there were some issues or emails from APAC, work late in the night to deliver projects that had very tough deadlines, etc. In reality, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like that every day but it seems like that. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been nostalgic about my time in India and it has always felt like there was no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I look back at the last decade, I have read many books. Most of my Software Engineering related reading happened in the last 15 years. Reminds me to create a section for Software / Computer Science related books in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinsonraju.info/blog/reading-list/&#34;&gt;Reading List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember reading a lot of poetry in the first couple of years. Was still in touch with friends from Chennai and Bangalore and we used to exchange poems even during Chennai days. Was even writing poems during that time. &lt;strong&gt;Emily Dickinson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Browning&lt;/strong&gt; were my favorite poets I think. Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s sonnets were a great read. So were other poets like &lt;strong&gt;William Blake, Rudyard Kipling, HW Longfellow, John Donne, Tennyson, Rumi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longfellow&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;The Arrow and The Song&lt;/strong&gt;,  Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Sonnet 18&lt;/strong&gt; (Shall I compare thee to a summer&amp;rsquo;s day), &lt;strong&gt;Sonnet 116&lt;/strong&gt; (Let me not to the marriage of true minds),  John Donne&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;No Man is an Island&lt;/strong&gt;, Robert Frost&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Stopping by the woods&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The Road not taken&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Mending Wall (Good fences make good neighbors)&lt;/strong&gt;, Kipling&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt;, Elizabeth Browning&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;How do I Love Thee&lt;/strong&gt;, W.E Henley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Invictus&lt;/strong&gt;, William Blake&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;The Poison Tree&lt;/strong&gt;, Wordsworth&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;, Konstantinos  Kavafis&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Ithaca&lt;/strong&gt; are poems that I&amp;rsquo;d recommend to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, AK, my wife, and I wrote a book of poems and called it &lt;strong&gt;Sycamore Tree&lt;/strong&gt;. It might have had around 20-25 poems. Not published though. AK has gone ahead and written over 100 poems by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AK is a more prolific reader than I am, and I&amp;rsquo;ve read many books after she has read them. &lt;strong&gt;Susan Cain&amp;rsquo;s Quiet&lt;/strong&gt; comes to mind. She loves classics too. She has probably read &lt;strong&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/strong&gt; five-six times. I read &lt;strong&gt;Of Love and Other Demons&lt;/strong&gt; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, &lt;strong&gt;Dear Life&lt;/strong&gt; by Alice Munro, and a few other books from her list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my neighbors suggested reading &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Stroud&lt;/strong&gt; and I loved the three books in The Bartimaeus Trilogy - &lt;strong&gt;The Amulet of Samarkand, The Golem&amp;rsquo;s Eye&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ptolemy&amp;rsquo;s Gate&lt;/strong&gt;. Read &lt;strong&gt;Lockwood &amp;amp; Co.: The Screaming Staircase&lt;/strong&gt; while on a trip to Denver a few years back. It was a great experience. Took me back to the early days of reading Hardy Boys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague had recommended &lt;strong&gt;Neal Stephenson&amp;rsquo;s Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt;. Was astounded by that. Stephenson had pretty much predicted a lot of things way back in the 90s. Need to read more of Stephenson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last two years were good in terms of being exposed to reading and books. MT runs an &amp;lsquo;Authors Series&amp;rsquo; in the campus where Authors of books come and talk about their books. Just attending them and getting a gist of the books were great time spent. I have all those books in my bookshelf waiting to be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; - I will probably come back update this since more memories may come back in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
