        <description>Happened to watch the first 3 episodes of Raised by Wolves1. I was expecting just an episode to get launched in the typical HBO fashion. But getting 3 episodes was a bonus.</description>

        <description>Thoughts This was the first Thomas Hardy novel that I&amp;rsquo;d read, probably during my engineering days, and re-reading it brings a lot of memories back. What I realize is that I got the gist of the story but had missed out on a lot of details that Hardy provides.</description>

&amp;ldquo;The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.</description>

        <description>As a person who loves checking off items in &amp;lsquo;to-do&amp;rsquo; lists and checklists, I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked books that have a list of rules/principles. Hence books like Effective Java, 201 Principles are the ones that come to mind when I think of a reading list of books related to Software Development.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re at a point in history where were have examples of massive data breaches in the past to study from, and also an unprecedented number of businesses going online at a rapid pace, accelerated by shelter-in-place rules enforced to stem the spread of covid-19 virus.</description>

        <description>I was introduced to The Knowledge Project by AJ last year during one of our 1-1 walks around the campus. He sent me the link to Naval Ravikant&amp;rsquo;s podcast after the walk, and I listened to it in the bus on the way back home.</description>

        <description>This is probably the 3rd time I&amp;rsquo;m reading this book. Got this book when I attended Payments 101 &amp;amp; 201 by Glenbrook in Jan/Feb 2015. It was just a couple of days but was one of the best courses I&amp;rsquo;ve attended.</description>

        <description>I like the writing style of Malcom Gladwell. With enchanting short real-life stories and fascinating anecdotes, he takes you right into the book, to a different world where you are a student who is observing and studying the behavior of the people in different parts of the world, effortlessly moving to and fro through different periods of time.</description>

        <description>Introduction In the earlier days of the software industry, the process of developing software products mirrored engineering practices of the day.

        <description>Reading &amp;ldquo;The Proof of Heaven&amp;rdquo; by Dr. Eben Alexander is almost like experiencing the NDE that he went through, to really be at the hospital with him where his loved ones were holding his hand 24/7 while he was in a coma, to be with him while he went through the underground, the gateway and the core back and forth experiencing the bright light and the melodious songs and the angelic being, to be able to hear with the whole being without anyone talking, to be able to see without physical eyes, to not have a concept of time, to feel a divine presence and be overjoyed to the fullest.</description>

        <description>More than a year whizzed past without me writing anything here.
When you&amp;rsquo;re working for a company that does more than double the work in less than half the time that the client does it in and if the client happens to be this uber-fast techie company that rolls out 8 million lines of code once every 2 weeks with almost 50K lines of code changing every week, time is a pricey quantity.</description>

        <description>I’m lying flat on my back and looking at the open sky. It is clear. There are no stars. Only a single moon.
Is the queen of the night sky smiling at me ?</description>

        <description>Re-lived a wonderful moment when I accidentally read one of my old scribblings.
 There are some places where the moment you go, you feel completely at ease ; you’d stay, transfixed with a longing in your heart to be left there forever!</description>

        <description>Some days you get up slowly ..
sit or sometimes sit n sleep on the bed for sometime ..
wait for thoughts to gather, slowly come into terms with the world – as though you need time to gradually transition from one world to completely different one – as though you just came out of water and you’re gasping for breath.</description>

        <description>Though sleeping, reading and watching movies were the only major things that I did during this weekend, what I really wanted to do was to go to a beach, write something, put it into a bottle and throw it into the sea.</description>

        <description>I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge.
That myth is more potent than history.
That dreams are more powerful than facts.
That hope always triumphs over experience.</description>
