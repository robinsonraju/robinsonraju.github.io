"...bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens <br>
Brown paper packages tied up with strings,<br>
These are a few of my favorite things."<br>
</i>
~ 'The Sound of Music'
<p>The first thing that I did was to watch the rest of &lsquo;The Sound of Music'<br>
The &lsquo;favourite things&rsquo; song was still afresh in my mind. I&rsquo;d watched it till Maria stealthily ran away to the abbey. D had said it was the best of movies ! must-watch-should-not-be-missed kind of movie. It is a musical about a wannabe nun being a governess in a Captains house (palace!) gaining the confidence of his 7 kids. It’s a classic. It’s a jolly ride, I’d say – jolly roller coaster musical flow in and out of good times.</p>
<p>By the time I finished everyone was awake.. <br>
N, reading paper – &ldquo;They’ve opened a new park near downtown. Let’s go.&rdquo; <br>
Me – &ldquo;Yup..I anyway needed to go to the library.&rdquo; <br>
N – “ok. We’ll cook something, take it and eat it from there.”<br>
Me – “We’ll eat here and then go there. I don’t like to eat in open spaces.”<br>
N – “It’ll be cool to eat in the park. It’ll be like a picnic. We’ll eat there.”<br></p>
<p>May be because I’ve seen too many parks littered with leftovers .. I don’t like to eat in parks. Aren’t parks meant to be .. I don’t know .. heaven-in-the-middle-of-rubble or something ? a serene place ? a place where you just sat silently or walked slowly or.. whatever.. well ! it’s my personal prob. I’d rather not impose my ideas into someone else.</p>
<p>I went to the library .. and to my surprise saw that there was a book sale going on there. Bought some books. That kind of put me back into good spirits. Called up N to find out if he was coming to the park. He was ready. We found the park, sat on the green grass.. Using bag as pillow I lay flat on the grass and started reading ‘message in a bottle’. <br>
N unpacked and had his lunch. <br>
After a while he turned towards me .. <br>
“How was the sale ? what did you buy ?”<br>
“Not many .. arnd 5.”<br>
N inspected . he put aside ‘Frenchman’s Creek’ , ‘Life of Pi’ …and other books. I knew his eye’d stop at Republic and it did ! ‘Plato’s Republic ! boy ! I always wanted to read it..’ He started reading it and before long, WE started reading it. The whole book’s in the form of dialogues. He read a dialogue and I the next. We played Socrates, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus alternatively .. and even as we were returning home.. we were arguing .. about ‘justice’</p>
