  <div itemprop="articleBody" id="content" class="article-body margin-top-2em">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of migrating the site to a new theme which had a better font than I had. Also wanted a smaller font to cover lot of text in a smaller area. Stumbled upon <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/paperesque/">paperesque</a> theme on hugo themes site. It was a simple theme with lot more focus on writing.</p>
<p>So, spent some time migrating to the new theme. It is cloudy outside due to the forest fires on Mount Diablo. It seems like winter and somehow looking out of the window and seeing an overcast sky seems to be the perfect weather to write/read or do this work.</p>
<p>One thing about migration of any software is that one always enters into it with optimism, thinking that it is going to be simple, just a few minutes of work of swapping one thing for another. That&rsquo;s probably why most migration projects run over budget. Many times new things are discovered only after one starts the work. But it is fun, challenging and engaging work. While doing it, one might feel like it is a time sucker and want to give up but if you keep at it, the end results are quite satisfying.</p>
<p>Few issues that I had to fix were the following. There was a JS error during build that I temporarily fixed by removing it from head_includes.html. There were a few shortcodes that I had created in the aurora theme that I had to bring over. Spent some time figuring out how to change the home page. Tried to use the old style of two columns with a lot of links. Then decided against it. Wanted to put that content into about.md. Was wondering how to do that and then realized that the easiest way to embed HTML into markdown file is to create a shortcode. Shortcode is a super-power in hugo. One can do a lot of wonders using that. Also, spent time figuring out how to add social media buttons on the <a href="/about">About</a> page. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_social_media_buttons2">W3 schools</a> has the easiest example to embed social media buttons.</p>
<p>I wish I had saved the screenshots of all the previous sites. I could see how the site evolved over time. At least I have the code now and it is an easy thing to revert to a previous commit in git to get to a version at that point in time. Here is the before and after of the current migration.</p>
