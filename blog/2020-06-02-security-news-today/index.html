    <p>The optimism around cybersecurity was dampened today by a news article on WSJ - <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cybersecurity-startups-feel-a-pinch-on-funding-and-sales-11591090202">&ldquo;Cybersecurity Startups Feel a Pinch on Funding and Sales&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cybersecurity startups are finding they have to do more with less, as the economic drag of coronavirus precautions makes it difficult to sell their products and enlist new customers while it simultaneously diminishes the size of their funding rounds, investors say.</em>[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article also mentioned that there are thousands of small cybersecurity vendors trying to get business from Fortune 500 companies. So is the author hinting at &ldquo;more supply than demand&rdquo;?</p>
<p>But a New York Times article and many such suggest that there are millions of jobs being unfilled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A stunning statistic is reverberating in cybersecurity: An estimated 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs will be available but unfilled by 2021.</em> [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that as more people adopt to digital life, either due to COVID-19 or due to other reasons, cybersecurity becomes center stage. Take Zoom, for example. As more people started using the software, few security and privacy issues were found. &lsquo;Zoombombing&rsquo; became a new buzzword where people were sharing instances of strangers joining their calls. So, though the recent slump may weed out some startups, there are surely many more on the horizon. The times we live in, demands it.</p>
<p>In another article, a security researcher claimed 100K for exposing a vulnerability with apple sign-in [3]. Wow! But I was immediately thinking of the engineers on the other side. Zero-day vulnerabilities (A type of vulnerability that is not known to the software dev or vendor but to the attacker), are the worst. Companies pour money into bug bounty programs to find these. As someone who managed a sensitive application, I have been on the other side. It is like standing on a needle where every second is valuable, and it&rsquo;s a race to resolve it before anyone else finds out. It is AHOD, you gather the most important folks, don&rsquo;t talk about it to anyone during the issue resolution and once it&rsquo;s done, you forget about it.</p>
<p>That reminds me to start writing notes about &lsquo;Life After Google&rsquo; [4]. Gilder does list a few items that he thinks should be the cornerstone of a new blockchain-based system. Here are the 7 principles of <em>&lsquo;The Blockstack movement&rsquo;</em>, as mentioned in the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Distributed cadastre</strong>: Assures security through logical centralization</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Maximum scalability</strong>: Assures performance and scalability by separating the control plane from the data plane.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Single prototype</strong>: Establishes property rights by upholding the principle and precedence of singular documents, time-stamped, recorded, and algorithmically allocated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Parallel complement</strong>: Its expansion confers benefits of privacy and property on its participants without directly threatening incumbents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5. Low-entropy carrier</strong>: Provides a stable, predictable, and monolithic foundation for the high-entropy metaverse on the edge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6. Free migration</strong>: It allows unobstructed passage from one blockchain or network to another without locking in users.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>7. End-to-end, trust-to-trust</strong>: All nodes rest on roots of trust that are not heavily dependent on outside authorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough to be able to talk much about these things yet, but would definitely be interested in knowing more about #3 - Single prototype.</p>
