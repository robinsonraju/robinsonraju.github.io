<p><em>&ldquo;When I think about my personal experiences with leading over the past few years, the only endeavors that have required the same level of self-awareness and equally high-level “comms plans” are being married for twenty-four years and parenting. And that’s saying something. I completely underestimated the pull on my emotional bandwidth, the sheer determination it takes to stay calm under pressure, and <strong>the weight of continuous problem solving and decision making</strong>. Oh, yeah—and the sleepless nights.&quot;</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would emphasize <em>the weight of continuous problem solving and decision making</em>. Over the last few years, as a Sr. Eng Manager, I&rsquo;ve promoted a few folks to first time Engineering Managers, conducted a lot of interviews of very talented people who wanted join the company as Eng Managers. My questions were generally very simple and someone who has &lsquo;been there, done that&rsquo;, would easily be able to answer with specific examples of scenarios where they did this or that. The key goal is to gauge how effective that person would be in a continuous problem solving environment. The problem could be related to a production incident that needs to be handled asap, a design decision to give inputs on which path is better to meet the objectives, asked to take up a project without clear or any requirements, performance issues of the system, people related issues, setting up of goals and vision for the team that is overdue, status reports to upper management, and so on. How to deal with multiple things by prioritizing the right things at the right time is the key to being effective. Of course, there are frameworks in place in most successful companies to make sure that employees are as effective as possible.</p>
<p>I would say 1 question in each of the following areas would help to determine if the person is a <strong>great</strong> fit. I&rsquo;m stressing on &lsquo;great&rsquo; because most of the times, a team always gets a lot of people who are good fits. Think of it, the person that you might be doing an onsite interview with, has already gone through multiple filtration process. If 500 people had applied for a position, after the recruiter filters out potential candidates, the list might go down to 100 or even 50. If we get to doing telephone interviews of 20 folks, may be we&rsquo;d bring only 5 candidates onsite. My rule of thumb would be to start doing onsite interviews after doing around 10 telephone interviews and prioritizing the most promising candidate first. Continue doing telephone interviews even when onsite interviews are going on.</p>
<p>Many folks have asked me this question - &ldquo;I&rsquo;m attending many interviews but I&rsquo;m not getting selected. What am I doing wrong?&rdquo; First of all, you might actually not be doing anything wrong at all. It might just be the case, that the company found a better fit or didn&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to interview all the 100 candidates that they shortlisted. In fact, one of the first problems that I had learnt in CS class on &lsquo;Randomized Algorithms&rsquo; was the Secretary Problem which I think said that if you need to hire 100 people, randomize and interview the first 33%, and choose the best among that. It is the optimum solution and and example of &lsquo;Optimized Stopping&rsquo;. I think the first chapter on a fun to read book &lsquo;Algorithm&rsquo;s to Live by&rsquo; has the same problem. Though it is related to searching for real estate in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Anyway, coming back to my areas and questions -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Interest</strong> - Sample question. &ldquo;Why are you interested in this job?&quot;. There are many variants of this and the main objective is to find out - What makes you qualified? Why did you get into management? How big of a team are you comfortable managing? What kind of challenges do you like, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hiring</strong> - &ldquo;What do you look for when you hire someone?&quot;. The discussion around this area would be to find out - Are you hiring for a fit into the team? Are you hiring to raise the bar? Are you hiring with diversity in mind? etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Skill</strong> - &ldquo;Tell me of a time when you recommended a technology but did not get accepted?&quot;. The discussions around this would be the find out - Are you abreast with technology that we&rsquo;re using? Do you have a good handle on technologies that you&rsquo;ve mentioned in your resume? Can you agree/disagree logically with architects and tech leads, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Management</strong> -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong> -</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I generally ask question on process, especially around CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) since I think that makes a huge difference in building and maintaining highly scalable software systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back and edit this post. Regarding materials to read, I would suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897/">The Manager&rsquo;s Path</a> or other books mentioned in my article on <a href="/blog/2020-07-03-reading-list-leadership/">Leadership - Essential Books</a>.</p>
