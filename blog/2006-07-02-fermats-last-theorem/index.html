        <h3>Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem - Amir Aczel
        </h3>
        
        </div>

    <p>Amir Aczel’s &ldquo;Fermat’s Last Theorem&rdquo; begins with this amazing quote by Andrew Wiles.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Yes ! he is the one .. the mathematician who solved the most famous unsolvable problem in the history of Mathematics . Over a span of 3 centuries, thousands of brilliant and hardworking men and women were at it.. and in the quest had discovered so many ground-breaking theories ..even new branches of Maths!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I was just dumbfounded the moment I read it - at the sheer truth behind it. Here it goes ..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Exactly !! I think this applies to most situations in life! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I’ve been in this groping-in-the-dark-what-do-I-do-next state so many times !<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
May be that’s the joy of teaching.. you see someone groping in the dark and help him/her to the switch and when the room lightens up .. the look on the bright face..that look is the bliss of teaching. And vice versa.. anyone’d be really happy to be with a person who ‘knows’!</p>
<p>There are so many mathematicians mentioned in the book.. Euler.. Gauss .. Galois .. Sophie Germain .. I can see them all..as though they spent their lives on earth just recently. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Whatever was written about Gauss in the book, I already knew.. even the story of his teacher giving the 7 yr old Gauss with a difficult monotonous problem like 1+2+3+..100 as punishment and him solving it in a couple of minutes ! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Galois was a revelation .. I was reminded of Marlowe.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A really bright star who came in, brightened the whole sky with brilliant blinding light , then swiftly disappeared.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
He was so brilliant that he could solve most equations in his mind. In fact he couldn’t get into the most famous college at that time because he wrote the answers directly without intermediate steps. While still a schoolboy, he’d learnt all the higher level mathematical theories extant at that time and had developed the theory in his name – the Galois theory !<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Galois died in a political duel. The night before the duel.. he was so convinced he would die, that he wrote down his complete mathematical theory and sent it to his friend. At the time of his death, he was just 20!</p>
