              <p>While I was walking down the <a href="/blog/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/">memory lane</a> yesterday, I remembered meeting RR in Chennai and his gift of <strong>Crime and Punishment</strong> by <strong>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</strong>. We were best friends in school and I had lost touch with him during engineering. One day there was an email and he said he was in Chennai. We agreed to meet. It was either a Saturday or a Sunday. I used to teach Math for CAT students during the weekends. I had finished a class and met RR at Landmark (book shop) in a mall. It probably was Spencer&rsquo;s but not fully sure. He gifted me this book and it was a great surprise. He used to give greeting cards in the past with some inspiring and soulful words written beautifully. Expecting him to have written something, I opened the book to find a quote among other wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Obstacles are things you see when you take your eyes off the goal.</em>&rdquo; ~ Henry Ford</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, Dostoyevsky was an author who I wanted to read but hadn&rsquo;t read. My first introduction to Dostoyevsky happened probably during high school/PU days. Through a book named <strong>Oru Sangeerthanam Pole</strong> (Like a Psalm) by <strong>Perumbadavam</strong>. I think I read the book from Viveknagar library. The author called Dostoyevsky as <em>Hridayathinu mel dhaivathinte kayyoppulla aal</em> (A man who has God&rsquo;s signature on his heart).</p>
<p>I used to visit Viveknagar library often. It was a small government library which was close to the bus stand. It used to open in the morning, close in the afternoon and open in the evening around 5. Many times, I used to wait for the libarian to come. There were few other people also waiting, usually to read newspaper or magazines. Since it was a govt library, there were books in all languages - many in Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, etc. I had read most of the English books that were available. Moreover our school had a bigger library with lot more choices. There was a small section of Malayalam books - probably around 20-30 books. I&rsquo;d read a few of them in the library. <strong>Kanam</strong> and <strong>Parappurath</strong> are two authors I remember. I had heard of Dostoyevsky for the first time from one of the books I read during this time.</p>
<p><strong>Oru Sangeerthanam Pole</strong> is about Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s affair with Anna who he marries later. It describes him as a person anyone would hate. He was a drunkard, gambler, lonely and depressed. He has a deadline to write a novel but had not started even a single page. I was thinking that someone like him may not make it anywhere in India. The society, in general is very intolerant of people who drink.</p>
<p>The connection between Russia and Kerala itself is something to think about. How did Communism make its way to Kerala? How is there a Communist party which is Leninist. Saw a movie couple of years back called <strong>Comrade In America (CIA)</strong> where the protagonist has a chat with Che Guvera, Marx and Lenin during a difficult time. Anyway, the Russia connection is something to read about for a later time.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to read <strong>Oru Sangeerthanam Pole</strong> and <strong>Crime and Punishment</strong> again. Last year I read a book named <strong>12 Rules for Life</strong> by Jordan Peterson. Peterson refers to Dostoyevsky multiple times in his book. Of course, he talks more about Solzhenitsyn&rsquo;s <strong>Gulag Archipelago</strong> but he was a big fan of Dostoyevsky and urges us to read his books.</p>
