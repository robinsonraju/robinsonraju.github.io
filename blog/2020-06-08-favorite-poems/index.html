              <p>In the post about <a href="/blog/2020-06-06-the-reading-journey/">my reading journey</a>, I had mentioned a few poems that were my favorite. Thought I&rsquo;d just put them all here. One place to come back to read them over and again!</p>
<h2 id="the-arrow-and-the-song">The Arrow and the Song</h2>
<pre><code>I shot an arrow into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
Could not follow it in its flight.

I breathed a song into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For who has sight so keen and strong,
That it can follow the flight of song?

Long, long afterward, in an oak
I found the arrow, still unbroke;
And the song, from beginning to end,
I found again in the heart of a friend.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44624/the-arrow-and-the-song">The Arrow and the Song</a> by H. W. Longfellow</p>
<p>Other favorite Longfellow poems - <strong>A Psalm of Life</strong> (<em>Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us, Footprints on the sands of time;</em>), <strong>The Day is Done</strong> (<em>Then read from the treasured volume, The poem of thy choice, &hellip; And the cares, that infest the day &hellip; Shall fold their tents &hellip; And as silently steal away</em>)</p>
<h2 id="hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers">&ldquo;Hope&rdquo; is the thing with feathers</h2>
<pre><code>&quot;Hope&quot; is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -
And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -

I’ve heard it in the chillest land -
And on the strangest Sea -
Yet - never - in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of me.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314">&ldquo;Hope&rdquo; is the thing with feathers</a> by Emily Dickinson</p>
<p>Other favorite Emily Dickinson poems - <strong>Success is counted sweetest</strong> (<em>By those who ne&rsquo;er succeed.</em>), <strong>Tell all the truth but tell it slant</strong> (<em>The Truth must dazzle gradually, Or every man be blind</em>)</p>
<h2 id="ithaca">Ithaca</h2>
<pre><code>As you set out for Ithaka
hope your road is a long one,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:
you’ll never find things like that on your way
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,
as long as a rare excitement
stirs your spirit and your body.
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them
unless you bring them along inside your soul,
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.

Hope your road is a long one.
May there be many summer mornings when,
with what pleasure, what joy,
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations
to buy fine things,
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,
sensual perfume of every kind—
as many sensual perfumes as you can;
and may you visit many Egyptian cities
to learn and go on learning from their scholars.

Keep Ithaka always in your mind.
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.
But don’t hurry the journey at all.
Better if it lasts for years,
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.

Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.
Without her you wouldn't have set out.
She has nothing left to give you now.

And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.

<h2 id="the-road-not-taken">The Road Not Taken</h2>
<pre><code>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken">The Road Not Taken</a> by Robert Frost</p>
<p>Other poems by Robert Frost that I liked - <strong>Stopping by the woods on a Snowy Evening</strong> (has the famous lines <em>I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep</em>),  <strong>Mending Wall</strong> (<em>Good fences make good neighbors</em>), <strong>Fire and Ice</strong> (Inspiration for GOT!)</p>
<h2 id="if">If</h2>
<pre><code>If you can keep your head when all about you   
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
  And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
  And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---">If</a> by Rudyard Kipling</p>
<p>Other favorite poems of Kipling - <strong>The Female of the Species</strong>, <strong>Mother o’ Mine</strong> (<em>If I were drowned in the deepest sea,&hellip; I know whose tears would come down to me</em>)</p>
<h2 id="invictus">Invictus</h2>
<pre><code>Out of the night that covers me,
  Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
  For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
  I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
  My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
  Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
  Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
  How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
  I am the captain of my soul.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus">Invictus</a> by W. E. Henley</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-love-thee-let-me-count-the-ways">How do I love thee? Let me count the ways</h2>
<pre><code>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right;
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43742/sonnets-from-the-portuguese-43-how-do-i-love-thee-let-me-count-the-ways">How do I love thee? Let me count the ways</a> by Elizabeth Barrett Browning <strong>Sonnets from the Portuguese 43</strong></p>
<p>Another great poem by Elizabeth Browning - <strong>If Thou Must Love Me, Let It Be for Naught</strong> (<em>Except for love’s sake only</em>)</p>
<h2 id="a-poison-tree">A Poison Tree</h2>
<pre><code>I was angry with my friend;
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I waterd it in fears,
Night &amp; morning with my tears:
And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night.
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine.

And into my garden stole,
When the night had veild the pole;
In the morning glad I see;
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45952/a-poison-tree">A Poison Tree</a> by William Blake</p>
<p>Other favorite poems by Blake - <strong>The Tyger</strong>, <strong>The Garden of Love</strong>, <strong>Never Seek to Tell thy Love</strong>,</p>
<h2 id="i-wandered-lonely-as-a-cloud">I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</h2>
<pre><code>I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45521/i-wandered-lonely-as-a-cloud">I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</a> by William Wordsworth</p>
<p>Other favorite poems by Wordsworth - <strong>Ode to Duty</strong>, <strong>To the Skylark</strong>, <strong>To the Cuckoo</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-lake-isle-of-innisfree">The Lake Isle of Innisfree</h2>
<pre><code>I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet’s wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43281/the-lake-isle-of-innisfree">The Lake Isle of Innisfree</a> by W. B. Yeats</p>
<p>Other favorite poems by Yeats - <strong>When you are old</strong>, <strong>The Stolen Child</strong>, <strong>He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,</strong> (<em>I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams</em>)</p>
<h2 id="let-me-not-to-the-marriage-of-true-minds">Let me not to the marriage of true minds</h2>
<pre><code>Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me prov'd,
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45106/sonnet-116-let-me-not-to-the-marriage-of-true-minds">Sonnet 116: Let me not to the marriage of true minds</a> by William Shakespeare</p>

<h2 id="no-man-is-an-island">No Man Is An Island</h2>
<pre><code>No man is an island,
Entire of itself,
Every man is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thy friend's
Or of thine own were:
Any man's death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind,
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
It tolls for thee.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/no-man-is-an-island/">No Man Is An Island</a> by John Donne</p>
<p>Other favorite poems by John Donne that I liked - <strong>Death, be not proud</strong>, <strong>The Flea</strong>, <strong>Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?</strong></p>
<h2 id="shadow-and-light-source-both">Shadow and Light Source Both</h2>
<pre><code>How does a part of the world leave the world?
How does wetness leave water?

Dont' try to put out fire by throwing on
more fire! Don't wash a wound with blood.

No matter how fast you run, your shadow
keeps up. Sometimes it's in front!

Only full overhead sun diminishes your shadow.
But that shadow has been serving you.

What hurts you, blesses you. Darkness is
your candle. Your boundaries are your quest.

I could explain this, but it will break the
glass cover on your heart, and there's no
fixing that.

You must have shadow and light source both.
Listen, and lay your head under the tree of awe.

When from that tree feathers and wings sprout on you,
be quieter than a dove. Don't even open your mouth for
even a coo.
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/shadow-and-light-source-both">Shadow and Light Source Both</a> by  Rumi (Translated by by Coleman Barks)</p>
<p>Other favorite poems of Rumi - <strong>Moving Water</strong> (<em>When  you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy.</em>), <strong>A Moment Of Happiness</strong> (<em>The parrots of heaven will be cracking sugar, as we laugh together, &hellip; In one form upon this earth, and in another form in a timeless sweet land.</em>), <strong>Be with those who help your being</strong> (<em>Don&rsquo;t sit with indifferent people, whose breath comes cold out of their mouths.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="on-teaching">On Teaching</h2>
<pre><code>Then said a teacher, Speak to us of Teaching.
And he said:
  No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.
  The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness.
  If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind.
  The astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding.
  The musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot give you the ear which arrests the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it.
  And he who is versed in the science of numbers can tell of the regions of weight and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.
  For the vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.
  And even as each one of you stands alone in God’s knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God and in his understanding of the earth.
