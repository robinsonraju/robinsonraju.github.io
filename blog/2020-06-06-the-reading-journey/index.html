              <p>Had a dream about me being in Chennai and being asked about a book that I was reading. I don&rsquo;t quite remember who it was but it was someone who was happy to see me with a book. That set me thinking.</p>
<p>It is great to be in this phase of life where I&rsquo;m getting time to read and also write a bit. I hope it lasts. Usually when things are running smoothly, something happens that throws everything upside down and before long, years would have passed by. Anyway, it feels good to sit back and reminisce.</p>
<h2 id="chennai-days">Chennai Days</h2>
<p>I was in Chennai for less than two years in my life but from a reading standpoint, it was a tremendous period. Was lucky to be with the philosopher quartets - JC, MS, AH and VS, who were well-read and used to frequently discuss books. VS was a real poet who penned poems in Tamil. Was introduced to Kant, Nietzsche, J Krishnamoorthi, Bertrand Russel and many authors during this period just by listening to them chat with each other. I believe that it was a stroke of luck that I was even placed in that team as my first job. Specific books that I recall right now are Robert Persig&rsquo;s &lsquo;<strong>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</strong>&rsquo; and Hemingway&rsquo;s &lsquo;<strong>Old Man and the Sea</strong>&rsquo; recommended by MS, Arthur C Clark &amp; Isaac Asimov novels by AH and &lsquo;Who moved my cheese&rsquo; and a few other business books by JC. AH gave me Arthur C. Clark&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rama II&rsquo; as a gift when I left Chennai.</p>
<p>Another group of friends were folks outside my team - few people who were in my class during the 3 month orientation where we were given a crash course of CS topics, my room mates, and friends of these people. PS was in my class and was a big Harry Potter fan. She had forwarded a pdf/text of the first book and I had liked the book a lot. AN was my junior and was from Bangalore. As Bangaloreans were &lsquo;foreigners&rsquo; in Chennai, I used to connect with b&rsquo;lore folks just to chat. He was a big fan of Lord of The Rings. When we used to meet in the hallways of Elnet/Tidel, he would talk at length about the story and it was pretty entertaining. I&rsquo;d credit PS and AN for my interest in fantasy novels.</p>
<p>Another great influence for my reading during that time was DT. She was PS&rsquo;s friend and also was in my roommate RV&rsquo;s team, I think. She was a great fan of English classics. I think I read most of Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s novels during this period</p>
<ul>
<li>The Return of the Native, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Far from the Madding Crowd, Tess of the dâ€™Urbervilles, Under the Greenwood Tree. Also remember reading George Eliot - The Mill on the Floss &amp; Silas Marner. I think I read Adam Bede after I came to the US. Her favorite books were Louisa May Alcott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Little Women&rsquo; and &lsquo;Three Men in a boat&rsquo; by Jerome K Jerome. She introduced me to Somerset Maugham and AJ Cronin. Maugham&rsquo;s &lsquo;Of Human Bondage&rsquo; and Cronin&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Keys of the Kingdom&rsquo; were great reads. I read &lsquo;Keys of the Kingdom&rsquo; at a time when I was contemplating becoming a priest.  My goal was to work for a few years, get some personal things taken care of, and get into seminary. I did research a few places but wasn&rsquo;t sure how to get into. Also was waiting for a &lsquo;sign&rsquo; that never came!</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably need to go back a bit to see how I got to Chennai days</p>
<h2 id="primary-school">Primary School</h2>
<p>One of the first novels I remember reading is &ldquo;The Great Expectations&rdquo; by Charles Dickens. I got this book as a prize for getting first rank in 5th std. I remember reading the whole book but not understanding it much. I probably read a few times without understanding I think. I actually understood the story only after I read an abridged version. Another book that I remember reading during that time period is &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo;. I probably need to check with my mother how she knew about Charles Dickens and why she felt that reading Dickens will be great for me. Her advise was that I stick to reading only biographies or stories by Dickens, and so wasn&rsquo;t quite happy that I was reading a lot of fiction in high school.</p>
<p>I do remember reading a lot of Tinkle, Amar Chitra Katha during this time. Probably got them from Krishna or Joe or other friends in the neighborhood I think. Read Balarama and Balamangalam, mostly with Biju. My uncle had a lot of books in Kerala and when we used to visit during summer holiday, I used to spend a lot of time reading. Remember reading &lsquo;Ithihyamala&rsquo;, &lsquo;Purana Kathasagarangal&rsquo; and &lsquo;1001 Arabian Nights&rsquo;. Got really interested in mythology - Indian as well as Greek during this time. I read the stories of Ulysses, Achilles, etc. first time in Malayalam.</p>
<p>Another group of my readings during primary &amp; high school days were novels from Malayala Manorama weekly. Used to read it stealthily most of the time though. Josy Vagamattom, Joisy, Ettumanoor Sivakumar, Kottayam Pushpanath were my favorite authors. At least the ones that I remember now after 20 odd years. It used to be serialized, in which only a part of the story would be published every week and most of them always lingered on a cliff-hanger at the end. One was left waiting for next Wednesday to come! Josy Vagamattom wrote thrillers which had many fights - I remember Dravidan and a hero named Noble. Not sure if Noble was the . Joisy wrote poignant family dramas - I remember &lsquo;Ila pozhiyum shishiram&rsquo; in which a man comes back home from Gulf war after 5 years in captivity and finds that his wife had married his best friend. Ettumanoor Sivakumar was a writer of horror stories that had manthravadam (magic), yakshi (lady vampire), powerful munis and what not! Kottayam Pushpanath wrote detective stories that had a lot of twist and turns.</p>
<h2 id="high-school">High School</h2>
<p>High school was a totally different world than what I was exposed to till that point. Most kids were reading Hardy Boys, Secret Seven, Asterix and a few other books and comics that I&rsquo;d never heard of. In terms of reading volume, I probably read the max during that time. Read over 100 Hardy boys books, all of Agatha Christie, Jeffrey Archer, Sidney Sheldon, Robert Ludlum, Harold Robbins, Alistair MacLean, Jack Higgins, Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason) and so on. I think I was mostly reading Hardy boys in the 8th std. and suddenly jumped to reading Wilbur Smith, Harold Robbins, Jack Higgins, etc. in the 9th. Sometimes I read a book a day and rushed through them so fast that I barely remembered anything other than the main plot points. We were also going through a tough time personally and the books were a good escape. All the reading meant that I didn&rsquo;t study as much as I did during primary school. From someone who used to be upset with 99.75/100 in primary school and used to check with teacher to get 1/4 back, I became ok with just getting 90% in high school. There were life and death situations happening in the novels that I was reading! Jeffrey Archer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kane and Abel&rsquo;, Sydney Sheldon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rage of Angels&rsquo;, Alistair MacLean&rsquo;s &lsquo;Guns of Navarone&rsquo;, Robert Ludlum&rsquo;s Bourne series, were some of the best page turners that I&rsquo;ve read. The idea of starting with one of an author and reading through all of his/her books came during this time. We used to keep tabs on who had read every single book of Jeffrey Archer or Robert Ludlum.</p>
<h2 id="engineering">Engineering</h2>
<p>The most important novel that I remember reading during Engineering days is &lsquo;Atlas Shrugged&rsquo; by Ayn Rand. I did read many classics - Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Return of the Native&rsquo;. But I was studying during the day and taking tuitions for neighborhood kids in the evening and doing homework in the night. So there was not much time to read though.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-us">In the US</h2>
<p>Mostly read books related to software engineering.
A lot of my time in the US has been this cloud of time where I did nothing other than work. Get up in the morning and immediately check if there were some issues or emails from APAC, work late in the night to deliver projects that had very tough deadlines, etc. It probably wasn&rsquo;t like that every day but it seems like that.</p>
<p>Last two years were good in terms of being exposed to reading and books. MT runs an &lsquo;Authors Series&rsquo; in the campus where Authors of books come and talk about their books. Just attending them and getting a gist of the books were great time spent. I have all those books in my bookshelf waiting to be read.</p>
