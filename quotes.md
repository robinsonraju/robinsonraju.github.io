> "Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." ~ **Calvin Coolidge**

> “Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” ~ **Goethe**

> "A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor."

> "When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.
Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."
~ **Steve Jobs**

> "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently." 
~ **Henry Ford**

> "Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but of playing a poor hand well." 
~ **Robert L. Stevenson**

> "You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only option left."

~ **Mahatma Gandhi**

~ **Voltaire**

~ **Truman Capote**
