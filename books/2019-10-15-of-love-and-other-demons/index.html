              <p>There are some novels that start slowly, and build up momentum as we progress through the story. And there are others that start with a bang. &lsquo;Of love and other demons&rsquo; is definitely in the latter. The books opens with a letter from the author on how he came upon the story. That itself was probably fictional since that made it seem very real. On a routine round to cover a story for his newspaper, the author is sent to find out about the emptying/transportation of crypts of Santa Clara Convent, which is in a dilapidated state. He comes across an astonishing sight when after one of the crypts is open, they see a lot of copper colored hair out of a skeleton head. The author is reminded of a story that his grandmother had told him about a young girl with long hair, who got bitten by a dog, became mad and was later venerated as a saint since she performed miracles.</p>
<p>From the get go, when &ldquo;an ash gray dog with a white blaze&rdquo;, charges into a market and bites the protagonist, a young girl who is the daughter of a local nobleman, the novel transports the reader to a different place in a different era, and doesn&rsquo;t let go. Till the last page, we&rsquo;re intrigued by what is going to happen and are rooting for Sierva Maria to come out of the whole ordeal victorious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always wanted to read Marquez. I&rsquo;d heard about this famous book &lsquo;One Hundred Years of Solitude&rsquo; in high school or college, as a quiz question or may be it was a crossword puzzle on The Hindu. It was at the back of my mind. I read the prologue of this book our local library and was totally hooked. It was a worth read. AK also read the book. She also bought &lsquo;One Hundred Years&rsquo;. Haven&rsquo;t gotten to reading that yet though.</p>
<p>In short, the novel is about a young girl getting bitten (very small bite) by a dog. She is actually not affected but due to the rumours and superstitions, she is forced to undergo exorcism by many people. Finally is brought to a convent. The young priest there falls in love with the girl. Though he recommends that she is not mad, the authorities don&rsquo;t listen. It ends tragically for all the &lsquo;good&rsquo; people in the book.</p>
<p>What is good and not good is often a gray area. If you follow society&rsquo;s norms and act in the way it expects, then you&rsquo;re branded as good. The religious fanaticism that existed in the 17th century South America exists even today, almost everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The novel explores many themes, and one of them is the fight between good and evil. One could say that the &lsquo;good&rsquo; is the truth and everything that is natural in the world. The &lsquo;evil&rsquo; is dogma and superstition that plagued the society during that time period. A strong belief in demons and reliance on hearsay, made the people around Sierva Maria see her differently than what she really was.She was just a 12 year old adolescent who was coming out of childhood into adulthood. She was also a victim of neglect by her parents. Her Yoruban beliefs, songs, dances, painting her face black, etc. were part of her growing up and it was natural for her. She helped to skin rabbits, her face was painted black, her feet were bare, her head was wrapped in the red turban used by slave women, she could dance with grace, sing in various languages of Africa, imitate birds&rsquo; voice. She was happy with her life and her quest was to stay as she was though most of it was tangential to her European parents or the Church.</p>
<p>Abrenuncio&rsquo;s quest was to reject dogma and follow the scientific path. I think the novel depicts Sierva Maria, Dr. Abrenuncio, Martina Laborde, Dominga de Adviento and Father Tomas de Aquino as people who represent good and The Bishop, Bernarda, The Abbess and Sagunta as forces of evil. Father Delaura is on the side of good initially but does not have the guts to oppose the bishop and becomes and unwitting accomplice in the demise of Sierva. The Marquis also swings between the good and the evil side. Being lazy and unwilling to take responsibility itself puts him on the wrong side. Bernarda schemes and gets control of everything that her husband has but she is destroyed eventually due to her addiction to drugs and nymphomania. The Bishop is a religious fanatic who refuses to see the truth even after father Delaura tells him of his assessment and he condemns the girl as cursed by demonic possession. The Abbess of the convent is angry with the Bishop and takes that out on Sierva.</p>
<p>There is also the question of perspective. In the novel, the Indians and Blacks may be thinking of Europeans as evil, while the Europeans view the Indians or Blacks as possessed by demons.</p>
<p>I think the novel depicts that the conflict between good and evil is a human condition. Though we could judge the people based on our moral compass and group them as good vs evil, every person is fighting the battle against evil. What he or she thinks is evil could be based on his/her level of intelligence or what they&rsquo;ve been told. It is not just the external evil but also the internal one. The internal conflict sometimes manifests externally by being too good to people or too cruel. So a human life&rsquo;s journey is about fighting their own battle with their hidden evil and also fighting the external forces of evil from their standpoint.</p>
<p>The novel also alludes to the fact that people may not fully be in control of their destiny. One can only attempt to be true to oneself and hope that it align with the surroundings.</p>
