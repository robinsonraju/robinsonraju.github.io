                    <h4>Yuval Noah Harari</h4>

              <p>I read this book on the way to and during the Alaska Trip that we took during last winter (2019). Read on the flight from SF to Portland and from there to Anchorage. The bulk of the reading was done during the full-day train journey from Anchorage to Fairbanks on the 3rd day of the trip. That was a magical train journey - to go through untouched snow in a vast land seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>I had listened to Sapiens through Hoopla a couple of years back. Probably twice. During my practice runs for the half-marathon that I was running that year and also during the run itself. Audio books are much slower reads than actual reading and I sometimes tend to zone out. Hoping to read the book on print/kindle in the future. But whatever I had heard, it was though provoking and a well written book. It alters your perspective of the world and you begin to see the entire human history in a different light.</p>
<p>The author mentions that Sapiens was about the past of humanity, Home Deus was about the future and this book is about the present. He takes 21 problems, or 21 pressing concerns that the world if facing right now and addresses each of them. It is like reading 21 essays on different topics, well-articulated essays.</p>
<h2 id="part-i-the-technological-challenge">Part I: The Technological Challenge</h2>
<h3 id="chapter-1-disillusionment">Chapter 1: Disillusionment</h3>
<p>Humans think in stories than facts. Harari had mentioned in Sapiens that the key reason for ascendency of Homo Sapiens was the story telling ability.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The fascist story</strong> - History is a struggle of nations/races and one tries to subjugate another. Let&rsquo;s give importance to our nation and our ideals.</li>
<li><strong>The communist story</strong> - History is a struggle of classes where the upper class always tried to subjugate the lower. Let&rsquo;s envision a classless society.</li>
<li><strong>The liberal story</strong> - History is a struggle of liberty and tyranny. Let&rsquo;s build a world of freedom and equality.</li>
</ol>
<p>1938 - 3 global stories to choose from, 1968 - 2 stories to choose from (liberal, communist), 1998 - a single story (liberal democracy), 2018 - no story. Disillusionment !</p>
<p>Harari says that 2008 financial crisis precipitated the disillusionment and gave rise to a lot of pro-national sentiments. With the rise of Trump and Brexit in 2016, people seem to have developed a liking for the old racist and nationalist views. Nostalgia - Britain thinking of old glory, Islamist thinking of how things were 1400 yrs back during Caliphate, Zionists dreaming of going back 2,500 years back, and so forth!</p>
<p>Loved the paragraph about &ldquo;Humans vote with their feet&rdquo;. So true! There are millions of people who wish to immigrate to the US, Germany, Canada or Australia. How many wish to immigrate to China, India or Vietnam? People are willing to undergo extreme hardship to just cross the border and come to the US though there is so much bad press about how immigrants are treated badly, especially the ones from south of the border. How many Islamists from Syria or other countries want to migrate to Kuwait or Saudi vs Germany?</p>
<p>Harari defines a liberal set menu which outlines what it means at National and International level for Economic, Political and Personal areas. He is optimistic that people will not abandon liberal ideas altogether because of lack of viable alternatives. The dish might contain some items from the menu if not all.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2-work">Chapter 2: Work</h3>
<p>The fear of losing job to a machine has been there since the beginning of Industrial Revolution. But, if you look at the stats, for every job lost to a machine, at least one new job was created. Every job lost to the machine raised the standard of living multi-fold. But future may be different. Work in 2050 might to totally different since AI seeks to not just replace the mechanical work that humans do but cognitive also.</p>
<p>There are some tasks that AI is much better than humans. For e.g. driving. Driverless cars could reduce fatality by 90%! degree. Two important non-human abilities that AI possesses are connectivity and updatability. If there are a billion doctors in the world who need to be updated about a new disease, it is almost impossible, but if there were AI-doctors who are networked, it is almost instantaneous.</p>
<p>In areas like elder care, music, art, etc., it might take longer for AI to do what humans do.
In many fields, there might be more AI cooperation than competition. Also new jobs to debug, service AI will be created. But the key thing about the new jobs that will get created will be that they will require expertise. So retraining might be difficult.</p>
<p>In 2017 Google&rsquo;s AlphaZero defeated Stockfish 8 program in a game of chess. The milestone was critical since AlphaZero learnt chess from scratch in 4 hours! AI is competing with other AI and not with humans anymore!</p>
<p>The author does say that rise of AI may not lead to exploitation of humans like it happened during the Industrial Revolution. It might get to a point where everything becomes efficient and people are provided with what they need - food, clothing &amp; shelter. If one gets these things for free, will people go into irrelevance? Wow, one is reminded of &lsquo;The Matrix&rsquo; here. AI could actually put all humans to sleep and keep them in a dream state so that they don&rsquo;t destroy the earth!</p>
<p>The author talks about UBI (Universal Basic Income) or Universal Basic Services where social services are subsidized. It could become the utopian vision of communism!</p>
<p>He gives example of ultra-orthodox Jews who are poor and unemployed and spend all their time in studying scriptures. They are supported by the government and they are reported to have higher life satisfaction than other groups who have money and are employed!</p>
<p>The chapter ends with a positive, powerful note - &ldquo;<em>The quest for meaning and community might eclipse the quest for a job. If we manage to combine a universal economic safety net with strong communities and meaningful pursuits, losing our jobs to algorithms might actually turn out to be a blessing.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3-liberty">Chapter 3: Liberty</h3>
<p>During the Brexit vote, Ricard Dawkins had said that normal people should not have been asked to vote since most of them are not equipped to know the economic and political consequences of the decision. Elections are about what we feel and not what may be good for us. What people feel are mostly defined by their news feed or search results.</p>
<p>Computer algorithm might be better equipped to counsel humans than human feelings.</p>
<p><strong><code>b×c×d = ahh</code></strong> Biological knowledge multiplied by Computing power multiplied by Data equals Ability to Hack Humans.</p>
<p>Algorithm could help you choose a better movie that you might like than you could, decide what to do based on mood, what to buy, which career to choose, etc. Human feelings are shaped by survival and reproduction a million years ago but it is not the case with AI/Algorithms.</p>
<p>The author says that knowledge of Philosophy will be in great demand since the algorithms need it to make basic decisions to create more complex ones.</p>
<p>Digital dictatorship is more dangerous than any dictatorship that we&rsquo;ve seen in the past. Stalin didn&rsquo;t possibly know or have control over normal citizens. But AI could know about every single citizen. Big Data algorithms might extinguish liberty and also might simultaneously create the most unequal societies that ever existed.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4-equality">Chapter 4: Equality</h3>
<p>The rise of liberalism and increase in globalization in the 1900s promised a more egalitarian society than all the centuries in the past put together. People in India and Egypt could enjoy the same opportunities and privileges as Finland and Canada!</p>
<p>But in the 2000s, the trend is changing. Wealth seems to be getting concentrated with the 1%. The richest 100 people own more than the poorest 4 billion people!</p>
<p>With the rise of AI and breakthroughs in biotechnology, the divide could get larger and impossible to reduce. Rich people in the past could buy more possessions or live in grandeur. The average rich person was not more intelligent than an average poor person. But now, they could soon have the ability to extend life, have more brain capacity, be more beautiful. The rich might become a set of superhumans who are like gods. This would result in the separation of humankind into a small class of superhumans and a massive underclass of ordinary Homo sapiens. Similar to Greek mythology!
As the superhumans evolve to a different species, they might choose to wall themselves off widening the inequality.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, data will eclipse land and machinery as the most important asset. The race to control more data is already on with all the big corporations vying for more control. At the moment, ordinary people are more than willing to give away their personal data. In a battle between privacy and health, health is likely to win. But that is fraught with so many dangers even leading to people losing their liberty. But there is no way to ensure private ownership of data at the moment. A technology innovation in that area is very necessary.</p>
