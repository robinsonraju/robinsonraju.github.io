    <p>I was introduced to <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/">The Knowledge Project</a> by AJ last year during one of our 1-1 walks around the campus. He sent me the link to <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/naval-ravikant/">Naval Ravikant</a>&lsquo;s podcast after the walk, and I listened to it in the bus on the way back home. It was one of the best podcasts that I had listened to and was totally taken aback. It was like listening to a philosopher.  I subscribed to the podcast and to the newsletter. One of the newsletters earlier this month spoke about the release of Volume 2 of The Great Mental Models. And I was like, wow, I haven&rsquo;t even read the first volume. In order to be not left behind, I bought the kindle version of the books right away and started reading it.</p>
<p>It is a good read. But I think, it is one of those books where the hardcover would be better. Better formatted, with right things in the right pages. The book has many &lsquo;sidebar&rsquo; anecdotes or snippets that are very interesting but break the flow of the current topic at hand. Also, sometimes a picture that a paragraph refers to, could be found a couple of pages later. A kindle book is great when the content is mostly just text and it flows continuously. Going by the pictures of the book pages on <a href="https://fs.blog/tgmm/#volume_one">fs.blog</a>, looks like the hardcover would be a good buy. Probably will wait for all the books in the series to come out.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-mental-model">What is a Mental Model?</h3>
<p>As the book says, <em>&lsquo;A mental model is simply a representation of how something works.'</em> It is a way of looking at things and approaching problems that are presented to us. The chief goal in life, i.e if you want a comfortable life, is to have as few blind spots as one can. Either you work in a narrow area of your expertise or learn fast or try different things, you&rsquo;re always consciously or unconsciously trying to figure out how to make tomorrow better than today. I feel that everyone has a mental model of what is needed to effectively do something. They are all probably smaller variations of some universal mental models. Knowing more, would enable us to think better and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>The book presents nine mental models as &lsquo;general thinking concepts&rsquo;. They are things that you&rsquo;ve probably already heard of of know, but it is presented in a simple manner, with great quotes and memorable anecdotes.</p>
<p>The following are the mental models -</p>
<ol>
<li>The Map is not the Territory</li>
<li>Circle of competence (Supporting Idea - Falsifiability)</li>
<li>First principles thinking</li>
<li>Thought experiment (Supporting Idea - Necessity and Sufficiency)</li>
<li>Second-order thinking</li>
<li>Probabilistic thinking (Supporting Idea - Causation vs Correlation)</li>
<li>Inversion</li>
<li>Occam’s razor</li>
<li>Hanlon’s razor</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-the-map-is-not-the-territory">1. The Map is not the territory</h3>
<p>In &lsquo;The Map is not the territory&rsquo; the Authors outline that the &lsquo;map&rsquo; is a miniature version of the land and not the land itself. Knowing the map can help navigate the terrain but only going on the terrain gives full understanding of the terrain. Maps are very useful since they abstract away a lot of complexities and information bloat. When we read news or a book summary, we&rsquo;re reading abstractions created by other people who have condensed the information to smaller chunks to represent the actual information. The key issue with using maps is many times, we mistake map for the reality.</p>
<p>If I think of religion, I think though most religions have doctrines that are universal, many have rules that were written in the context of some particular scenario which has probably no relevance now. Map is useful only if we&rsquo;re able to use feedback loops to update the map based on the changed terrain.</p>
<p>The chapter gives example of Newtonian physics and how it couldn&rsquo;t explain interstellar phenomena that Einstein&rsquo;s Special theory of relativity explains well.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t quite understand if the sidebar on &lsquo;Tragedy of Commons&rsquo; was cautioning against every person looking out to profit for themselves or not. Probably it means that if we&rsquo;re working on a shared resource, the map becomes useless if everyone does things that doesn&rsquo;t align with &lsquo;sharing&rsquo; principle.</p>
<p>In order to use the map effectively, one must take 3 important considerations -</p>
<ul>
<li>a. Reality is the ultimate update - The actual terrain may be different, map might have missed something.</li>
<li>b. Consider the cartographer - The map maker might not be objective. What you might be seeing is one representation.</li>
<li>c. Maps can influence territories - It is dangerous to fit complexity into simplification or extrapolate wrongly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chapter concludes by a short snippet about Frederick Taylor&rsquo;s <em>Scientific Theory of Management</em> of breaking down tasks into smaller pieces and specializing people which worked great on the factory floor but had to be changed with time in different office settings. I couldn&rsquo;t but wonder if Agile methodology is same as this!</p>
<h3 id="2-circle-of-competence">2. Circle of competence</h3>
<p>The second one is about Circle of competence. He clearly says that when one knows little, there is a sense of feeling of high confidence. The unknown unknowns are a lot. He talks about a novice vs a lifer. A lifer is someone who has been in the place or industry for a long time and knows a lot of things about the domain. It would always make sense to get inputs from a lifer. To have a lifer as a mentor would be a great asset.</p>
