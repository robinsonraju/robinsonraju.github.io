    <p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>With limited resources like food, shelter and space to satisfy an exponentially increasing set of basic needs, there is a constant struggle among and between humans and animals. In the midst of these conflicts, humans have developed mechanisms that are essential in assuring that costly outcomes do not arise. The struggle among humans engenders the concept of dominance hierarchy. Unfortunately, the hierarchy always favors those who sit at the top. To those who are below or at the bottom, their response is much costlier as it is dependent upon their need to survive. In being so costly, their responses can be extremely advantageous in surviving or escaping difficult circumstances. These responses consequently have an effect on the individuals’ overall psyche.  Peterson sums up this concept in stating that, &ldquo;To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order……It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to please God, in the ancient language).”</p>
<p>Chapter 2
Summary
The understanding of chaos and order is the foundation of this chapter. Using the biblical story of Adam and Eve, Peterson describes man&rsquo;s tendency to indulge in self-destructing and self-shaming behaviors. When people choose to take care of others, they have a selfless desire which often exceeds the society’s expected norms . Peterson associates this with action with an appetite for self-destruction.  Some people are always biting off more than they can chew, weighing themselves down with an excessive burden. He says that &ldquo;No matter who we are, Kalahari Desert-dweller or Wall Street banker, some things are under our control, and some things are not.” Feeling obligated to fix or tend to things that are not in an individual’s control can ultimately lead one down a path of destruction. It is important for individuals to take a step back from certain situations rather than taking on immense burdens. Peterson suggests that &ldquo;If I am someone&rsquo;s friend, family member, or lover, then I am morally obliged to bargain as hard on my behalf as they are on theirs.”   Peterson’s argument is valid in wanting to fight battles of those who you care for, but he fails to mention the importance of continuing to take care of yourself while doing so.</p>
<p>Analysis
Moreover, people are excellent at filling and offering prescriptions to pets than to themselves. Some families take care of their pets in a better manner than they take care of themselves. For example, they may be more concerned with the living conditions of the cats instead of paying attention to their own hygiene. The antithetical nature of the human condition extends to our priorities. Some individuals have a tendency to be more concerned with the flaws of others, but fail to recognize their own flaws. It is a tragedy of such a monumental proportion when individuals lack self-awareness as it can affect their relationships and experience of the world in a less meaningful or detrimental way. The best and most practical solution to avoiding this is to have the individual adopt the ability of self-reflection, which could also lead to a better self-understanding.</p>
