  <article class="markdown"><p>Jordan Peterson is one of those people who does not mince words. When you listen to his talks on YouTube, you always come back a little more pumped up and motivated than before. You also get a feeling that you&rsquo;ve not been doing enough and need to step up and take more responsibilities.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the book. Every rule is a context where he explains his philosophy and the reasoning behind them. He makes references that are wide-ranging - mythology, Bible, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Viktor Frankl, and so on. I wonder how someone who hasn&rsquo;t read Bible or Tolstoy could grasp everything in the book. Would definitely like to read it again and write a longer summary and notes.</p>
<p>Some portions can come across as elaborate explanation to make a simple point. But I found that type of story telling fascinating. His words are stern and advice direct. There are some great quotes.</p>
<p>The overarching theme is that &lsquo;the person&rsquo; matters. Every person can change, and can effect change. Every person has to make a hero&rsquo;s journey to succeed. There is no gold without the dragon. Find your dragon and slay it. By making small changes today, you can cause big changes in the future.</p>
