Her husband, Joe is a mild-mannered person. Mrs. Joe gives Pip and Joe bread and butter fo supper. Pip hides his in his trousers. Joe is surprised that Pip bolted the bread and Mrs. Joe is upset that he swallowed the whole thing. She gives him tar-water as punishment.
They discuss about the escaped convicts when they hear gunshots. They live near the coast, near the marshland, where ships that form as jails are docked.
Next morning is Christmas day. Pip is not able to sleep in the night and early in the morning, he gets up, takes some more food from the pantry, some brandy and runs off to the marshes in search of the convict.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-iii---pip-gives-food-to-the-convict">Chapter III - Pip gives food to the convict</h2>
<p>On his way, he sees man that he thinks is the convict, touches him and gets startled to know that the person is not the person as before. He thinks this is the young man the other man was talking about. The person runs away. Pip walks a bit more and finds the original convict and gives him food and the file. When Pip tells him about the other convict, this man is totally surprised. He gets to file away at the irons on his leg and ignores Pip. Pip slips away and runs towards home.</p>

<p>Pip rushes home thinking that his theft might have been found out. But is relieved to know that everyone is busy in dinner preparations for Christmas. They have some guests - Uncle Pumblechook (Joe&rsquo;s uncle), Mr. Wopsle (church clerk who has a voice better than the priest) and Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. During dinner Mrs. Joe and Uncle Pumblechook focus on Pip and tell him that he has to be grateful towards his sister. Joe tries to console Pip by pouring some gravy into his plate. Mr. Pumblechook drinks the brandy from the bottle and spits it out discovering that it was tar-water. Pip is frightened thinking that his stealth will get discovered. He is about to run out of the home, opens the door and sees cops outside.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-v---pip-and-joe-joins-soldiers-to-search-for-convicts">Chapter V - Pip and Joe joins soldiers to search for convicts</h2>
<p>Pip is relieved when the soldiers say that they need the services of a blacksmith. So they did not arrive to catch him! The soldiers need help to repair handcuffs. Joe helps with it after that, when they set out to find the fugitives, Joe, Mr. Wopsle and pip join them. After a long search they find them. The two men are found fighting each other in a ditch. The convict tells the soldiers that he was capturing the other convict to bring him to the prison. The soldiers capture both men and take them to the station. Pip wonders if the convict would think that he led the soldiers to them. The convict tells the soldiers that he had stolen some food and file from the blacksmith&rsquo;s home, thus clearing Pip&rsquo;s name. Joe says it is ok.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-vi---pip-and-joe-get-back-home">Chapter VI - Pip and Joe get back home</h2>
<p>Pip and Joe get back and tell the folks what happened. Everyone wonders how the thief broke in and have multiple theories including him entering through the chimney. Pip does&rsquo;t tell anyone, not even Joe.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-vii---pip-gets-the-opportunity-to-offer-services-a-rich-lady">Chapter VII - Pip gets the opportunity to offer services a rich lady</h2>
<p>Pip is not old enough to be apprenticed to Joe. So, he attends a school run by Mr. Wopsle&rsquo;s great aunt. Mr. Wopsle is a tenant of one of the rooms in the building. The building also has a little general shop. The grand-aunt is helped by Biddy who is her grand-daughter. Pip comes home and tries to teach Joe what he has learnt. Joe is super impressed. When asked why Joe didn&rsquo;t go to school, he talks about his childhood when his dad was a drunkard who beat up him and his mother. Since his mother was abused, he is very careful to note that he would never abuse his wife and is ok to take abuse from her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Joe makes occasional trips with Mr. Pumblechook on market days to assist him to buy household items since he was a bachelor and didn&rsquo;t trust his servants. One of the days she returns with Mr. Pumblechook to inform Joe and Pip that a rich old lady, Ms. Havisham has asked for a boy and Mr. Pumblechook was gracious enough to suggest Pip. She is very happy and grateful to Mr. Pumblechook for the opportunity. Gets Pip cleaned up for the visit and leaves that night.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-viii---pip-visits-satis-house">Chapter VIII - Pip visits Satis House</h2>
<p>Pip stays with Mr. Pumblechook that night and is taken to Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s mansion the next day. Pumblechook reminds him to be grateful for the opportunity to go into this great house. Though the house is big, it seems very old and not maintained. A gruff young lady greets them, lets only Pip in. While walking she mentions that the name of the house is Manor House or Satis House. She leaves him in a room which doesn&rsquo;t have outside light coming in but has candles. Pip sees Ms. Havisham dressed in bridal clothes. They look grand but are old and yellow. She asks him to play and he is confused. She then asks him to call Estella. He calls her and they play cards. Estella beats him at the game and insults him for his looks and clothes throughout. He almost cries in front of Estella on the way back but holds back his tears. Pip is so embarrassed by himself that he kicks against a wall on the way back. He realizes that he is a low-life.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-ix---pip-describes-events-at-satis-house">Chapter IX - Pip describes events at Satis house</h2>
<p>Pip returns home to find everyone very curious to know what happened. Mr. Pumblechook says that he has never seen Ms. Havisham but has had interactions with the house many times on business. Pip is uncomfortable since he is still sad about him being low in the social strata. He invents a story about Ms. Havisham sitting on a black velvet coach, Estella handing her cake and wine on a gold plate, and four large dogs fighting for veal cutlets from a silver basket. They are totally astonished.</p>
<p>Later Pip tells Joe the truth and he admonishes Pip to not tell lies.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-x---pip-gets-money-from-the-convict-from-the-past">Chapter X - Pip gets money from the convict from the past</h2>
<p>Couple of days later Pip wakes up thinking - best step he could take towards making himself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew. So he goes over and learns from Biddy who is willing to help him with all that she knows. 
One day, his sister tells Pip to get Joe from a public house named Three Jolly Bargemen on his way back from school, since he goes there in the evenings to smoke. Pip goes there and a man offers them a drink. Joe refuses but the man insists. Pip notices that the man is stirring his drink with the file that Pip had stolen in the past. He gets a fright thinking that his secret would be out. The man gives Pip a shilling wrapped in paper which turns out to be pound notes. Joe goes back thinking it was a mistake but are not able to find the man. Pip has a nightmare about the file in his sleep.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xi---pip-goes-to-ms-havishams-again">Chapter XI - Pip goes to Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s again</h2>
<p>In the last meeting, Ms Havisham had told him to come after 6 days. The day comes and Pip makes a visit to the Manor House. Estella lets him in and takes him to a room where he sees some other people - 3 ladies and a man. A lady named Camilla, who reminded Pip of his sister, a man named Cousin Raymond, another lady named Sarah Pocket, another lady named Georgiana. They look at him and comment about him. He is then taken to another room where there is a wedding cake that is rotten and has insects crawling about them. Ms. Havisham holds Pip&rsquo;s hand and goes around in the room. She says that when she dies, her body will be on the table with all the people watching.</p>
<p>Pip plays cards with Estella with Ms. Havisham watching. Estella continues to insult him. On his way back, a thin boy approaches him and challenges him for a fight. Pip knocks him down but he always gets up to fight. Finally he gives up. Estella who is waiting at the gate doesn&rsquo;t ask him why he is late. She grants him a kiss. He kisses her but still feels like a downtrodden person.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xii---pips-appointment-at-ms-havishams-becomes-daily">Chapter XII - Pip&rsquo;s appointment at Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s becomes daily</h2>
<p>Next time when he goes over to the Manor House, Pip is half expecting to be punished or scolded for beating up the thin boy. But he doesn&rsquo;t find the boy anywhere nor is there any mention of him. He goes in and continues the regular thing of walking with Ms. Havisham in the room and playing with Estella. Sometimes the walk goes on for 3 hours. Ms. Havisham gets to know more about Pip, that he is set to be apprenticed to Joe when he grows older, etc. Pip is expected to go daily and that continues for many months.</p>
<p>One day, Ms. Havisham says Pip is old enough to be apprenticed and asks him to call Joe to the Manor House. He gets home and tells the news to Joe and Mrs. Joe. His sister is angry that she wasn&rsquo;t invited and takes it out on Joe and Pip. She asks Joe why he didn&rsquo;t marry a slave.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xiii---pips-apprenticeship-to-joe-is-formalized">Chapter XIII - Pip&rsquo;s apprenticeship to Joe is formalized</h2>
<p>The next day, Pip, Joe and his sister go over to the town. His sister goes to Mr. Pumblechook&rsquo;s place and Pip and Joe head over to Satis House. Estella opens the gate as usual, doesn&rsquo;t take any notice of them and leads them to Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s room. Ms. Havisham asks a few questions to them. Joe answers questions to Pip instead of to Ms. Havisham even for questions directed at him. It embarrasses Pip. Towards the end, Ms. Havisham gives a generous amount of 25 guineas and tells him to give it to his master, Joe.
They get back and tell Mrs. Joe and Mr. Pumblechook and they are very surprised at the amount given. As he goes back home, Pip realizes that the job that he once looked forward to, is not exciting anymore. He does not want to be a blacksmith.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xiv---pip-feels-bad-about-being-just-a-blacksmith">Chapter XIV - Pip feels bad about being just a blacksmith</h2>
<p>Pip says that it is a miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. He once felt distinguished and happy merely at the thought of becoming Joe&rsquo;s apprentice but not anymore. As he thinks back, he reminds himself of all the great qualities of Joe. The reason he did not run away or feel out of place, was not because he was virtuous, or faithful, it was because Joe was virtuous, Joe was faithful beyond measure.
Pip is haunted by the fear that Estella would come one day and see him with a black face and hands, dirtied by the job and consider him lower than she already thought and truly despise him.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xv---mrs-joe-is-attacked">Chapter XV - Mrs. Joe is attacked</h2>
<p>Pip continues to work for Joe. Since he has grown, his education at Mr. Wopsle&rsquo;s great-aunt&rsquo;s school is done. Biddy continues to teach him what she knows, Pip tries to learn things from Mr. Wopsle also. He tries to teach Joe what he knows it is not of much use.
One day, he asks Joe for half-day off to go to town and see Estella. Joe advises him against it telling him that Ms. Havisham might think that he has gone there to ask for something. Pip is insistent and Joe grants him his wish. Orlick, another chap who works with Joe also asks for half-day telling him that he should treat all employees equally. Joe relents. Mrs. Joe hears this and is totally furious. She asks Joe if he thinks he is so rich that he can afford to waste wages. Quarrel ensues between her and Orlick. Joe beats him up for talking bad to his wife.
Sunday comes and Pip goes to Satis House. Estella doesn&rsquo;t open the gate, it is Sarah Pocket. Ms. Havisham tells him that Estella has gone away abroad to be educated to become a lady and is prettier than ever, hoping to taunt him.
Pip is in no mood to go home. But goes over slowly. On the way he hears some commotion, someone says there is something wrong at his place. He reaches home to find that someone has broken in and knocked down Mrs. Joe with a very hard blow on her head.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xvi---mrs-joe-is-paralyzed-biddy-comes-to-stay-to-take-care-of-her">Chapter XVI - Mrs. Joe is paralyzed, Biddy comes to stay to take care of her</h2>
<p>They discover that the blow was made with the leg-iron that the convict had filed away long back. Mrs. Joe is completely bedridden and Joe and Pip take care of her with difficulty. Mrs. Joe cannot talk and does not know to write.
Lucky for them, Mr. Wopsle&rsquo;s great-aunt passes away and Biddy comes to stay with them. She nurses Mrs. Joe and takes care of others.
Mrs. Joe often used to write the symbol of T which Joe or Pip never understood. Biddy surmises that it could mean a hammer. They realize that Mrs. Joe means to say Orlick. They bring in Orlick thinking that she will denounce him as the person who hit her but she is friendly with him and he comes by often after that.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xvii---pip-confides-in-biddy-of-his-desire-to-become-a-gentleman">Chapter XVII - Pip confides in Biddy of his desire to become a gentleman</h2>
<p>Pip goes to Satis Manor on his birthday to visit Ms. Havisham. She gives him a guinea and tells him to come next yr during his birthday. Pip becomes conscious of Biddy changing into a neat young lady, though not as beautiful as Estella. He asks Biddy how she manages to take care of the house and also catch up with him on all the reading and learning. She reminds him jokingly that she is his first teacher. Pip has heartfelt conversations with Biddy on how he feels. He tells her that he wishes he could be happy as a blacksmith and be with Joe and her but he is not, he wants to be a gentleman. When he tells her than it is on account of a young lady at Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s, Biddy asks if he wants to be a gentleman to spite her or to win her. She gives the sage advice that both reasons are not good enough and that the lady is not worth winning over. Pip tells her frankly that it would have been easier if he was in love with her than with Estella. Biddy doesn&rsquo;t mind it and is thankful for his confidence. On the way back home, they meet Orlick and both hate to be with him. She says he has eyes on her and that&rsquo;s why she doesn&rsquo;t like him, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be of Pip&rsquo;s concern. They get home. Pip&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with life keep growing and he says that the confusion is fifty thousand fold and is scattering his wits.</p>
<p>This is probably the most poignant part of the story yet. One feels sad for Pip, sad for Biddy, and sad for being in a place of unhappiness.</p>


<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?&rdquo; Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I moodily answered.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Because if it is to spite her,&rdquo; Biddy pursued, &ldquo;I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.&quot;</em></p>

<h2 id="chapter-xviii---an-anonymous-patron-bestows-wealth-on-pip">Chapter XVIII - An anonymous patron bestows wealth on Pip</h2>
<p>It is the fourth year of his apprenticeship with Joe and on one Saturday evening, while they were in Three Jolly Bargemen, a lawyer presents himself and asks for Pip. Pip and Joe go with him to Joe&rsquo;s home, and Mr. Jaggers, the lawyer tells them that an anonymous patron wants to gift a property to Pip and fund his training to become a gentleman. At the beginning, Mr. Jaggers asks Joe if he wants money or some form of compensation for relieving Pip from his apprenticeship. Joe says no. Mr. Jaggers tells them that Pip will live in London and he can take training from anyone. Since he doesn&rsquo;t know anyone, Jaggers suggests Mr. Mathew Pocket whom he has heard of. Pip quickly makes the connection to Ms. Havisham since he had heard the name there. Jaggers gives him money to buy clothes. Joe is dumbfounded. Jaggers again asks if Joe needs any money for the loss of Pip&rsquo;s services and he says no. When Jaggers insists, Joe gets upset. Jaggers leaves. Pip decides that he will buy clothes but not wear them from the village, lest everyone see. He will wear them from Pumblechook&rsquo;s home and go to London. Pip tells Biddy and she is happy with the news. Though Joe and Biddy are cheerful, Pip is gloomy at the prospect of leaving. But he is also looking forward to leaving.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xix---pip-prepares-to-leave-his-village">Chapter XIX - Pip prepares to leave his village</h2>
<p>Pip prepares to leave to town to shop for clothes. He mentions to Joe that if he could read or &lsquo;get on a little more&rsquo; with the lessons, he could have come with him to London. Joe mentions that he is awfully dull and it is better for him here. Pip mentions the same to Biddy and she tells him that Joe might actually like it here in the village than in London. Pip thinks it is because of her jealousy. Biddy says he can think what he wants to. Pip goes over to the town. Pumblechook is totally a changed man to him now. He ingratiates himself to Pip by giving him the best food, shaking his hands many times and praises him often. Pip gets his new clothes and dresses himself up in those and goes over to Satis House. Sarah Pocket receives him at the gate and he gets to meet Ms. Havisham who already knows about his good fortune from Mr. Jaggers. Pip goes back to Pumblechook&rsquo;s place, changes clothes and goes to his village. His packs up and bids good bye to Joe and Biddy, who bid him a tearful good-bye. When he reaches the finger-post at the end of the village, he is also overcome with emotion and sheds a tear. He goes on, towards town, taking a coach, changing coaches along the way and onward to London.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xx---pip-reaches-london">Chapter XX - Pip reaches London</h2>
<p>Pip gets to London. He is scared by the immensity of London and does not like the ugly, crooked, narrow and dirty roads. He goes to Mr. Jaggers&rsquo;s office and finds out that he is in the court. He is asked to wait in the room. There are many others waiting for Jaggers. When Jaggers comes in he sees how others are scared of him. Jaggers tells him that he is to ramain with Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s son at Barnard&rsquo;s Inn, until Monday and then go to Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s home. He was given generous allowance and cards of many tradesmen from whom he could make purchases.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xxi---pip-meets-mr-pockets-son">Chapter XXI - Pip meets Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s son</h2>
<p>Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers&rsquo; assistant, takes Pip over to Barnard&rsquo;s Inn and Pip is not very impressed by the Inn from outside. Pip views it as an imperfect realization of one of his first great expectations. When they reach the room, they don&rsquo;t find young Mr. Pocket there. Instead they find a note that says &lsquo;Gone out, back shortly&rsquo;. Wemmick goes away and Pip waits for the young man to come. He takes a bit of time but eventually comes. He says that he had gone out to the market to get some fruits for Pip. When they get to see each other, Pip realizes that the young boy is the same &lsquo;pale young gentleman&rsquo; that he had beaten up at Satis House, for which he got a kiss from Estella! Both are surprised.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xxii---herbert-tells-pip-ms-havishams-sad-story">Chapter XXII - Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s sad story</h2>
<p>Pip finds that Herbert, Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s son, is a very amiable person. He tells him that Estella was adopted by Ms. Havisham and that he didn&rsquo;t care much for being betrothed to her. During dinner, Herbert tells Pip Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s story. While eating, he also teaches Pip upper class manners whenever a chance comes. He gives Pip the name of Handel, after a famous composer.</p>
<p>This quote about Pip&rsquo;s impression of Herbert, caught my eye -</p>


<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>
    <em>I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, <strong>a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean</strong>. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me he would <strong>never be very successful or rich</strong>.</em>
    
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I stopped reading the book and thought about myself at that moment!</p>
<p>Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s Story - Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s father was a country gentleman and also a brewer. After her mother died when she was young, her father denied her nothing and in his doting, he made her a spoit child. Her father married a servant in secret and had another child, Ms. Havisham&rsquo;s half brother. As the son grew, he turned out to be a rogue. The father disinherited him and he was out to take revenge. Ms. Havisham falls in love with a showy man who pretends to be a gentleman. But he stands her up during her wedding. It turns out that the man was friends with the half-brother and this was an act of revenge. Ms. Havisham is devastated. Time stops and she has been in her wedding dress with all the arrangements including the cake not being touched or removed after that.</p>
<p>Herbert says that he works in a counting house who is planning to get into trading in the future. Pip makes a visit to Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s house after a few days. He finds Mrs. Pocket sitting at a place and reading not bothering about her children. Two maid servants take care of the kids. Mr. Pocket is a good man but is overwhelmed by having so many kids (7 kids).</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xxiii---pip-meets-mr-mathew-pocket">Chapter XXIII - Pip meets Mr. Mathew Pocket</h2>
<p>Mr. Pocket is happy to see Pip and hopes that Pip also finds it good to be tutored by him.
Mrs. Pocket is the daughter of a knight and was brought up as a lady so that she could be an ornamental wife to a man of title. She ends up marrying Mr. Pocket against her dad&rsquo;s wishes. She is unable to manage her household which is run by the servants. She resents being an incapable person and laments her fall from being nobility.
Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and Cambridge and had distinguished himself, but he ruined his prospects by marrying early and to the wrong person. He had to take up tutoring to maintain his family. He is sad about his lost chances and tries to get a break as a favor from one of the parents of the youth he tutors. Though they promise him something, after the education is done, they forget.
Ms. Coiler, a snoopy neighbor, tries to get close to Pip and tells him that Mrs. Pocket thinks it is humiliating that her husband has to tutor.</p>

<p>Pip takes a long walk with Mr. Pocket and gets advice on how to improve. He like Mr. Pocket.
He travels to and fro between his apartment at St. Barnard which he shares with Herbert and Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s home.
He goes to Jaggers and requests for money to buy furniture and Jaggers is generous and asks his clerk Wemmick to write a check. Wemmick introduces him to other clerks and also gives him a glimpse of what type of personality Jaggers is. He tells him about the two masks on Jaggers desk, that they were of two famous clients. He takes Pip to court to see Jaggers in action and Pip is very impressed at the respect and fear that Jaggers commands.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xxv---pip-visits-wemmicks-castle">Chapter XXV - Pip visits Wemmick&rsquo;s Castle</h2>
<p>Other students of Mr. Pocket are introduced. Bentley Drummle is a rich spoilt kid who is a blockhead. Startop is a kid who is spoilt by over affection from his mother.
After a couple of months, Mr. Pocket is visited by the relatives of Ms. Havisham that Pip had met in the past. They are Mr and Mrs. Camilla and Georgiana. Camilla is Mr.Pocket&rsquo;s sister. Georgiana is a cousin. They don&rsquo;t have much regard for Mr.Pocket though.
Pip decides to visit Wemmick since he had invited him home. They walk to the home and get talking. Wemmick tells Pip that Jaggers never locks his door and challenges anyone to rob him.
Pip reaches the home and finds it to be a fancy one. Wemmick calls it &lsquo;The Castle&rsquo;. He designed, architected and built the home. It even has a drawbridge and canon (named Stinger). He has an elderly father who he calls &lsquo;The Aged&rsquo;. There is a little girl who takes care of the Aged. The dinner is excellent and Pip is very pleased.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xxvi---pip-and-friends-have-dinner-with-jaggers">Chapter XXVI - Pip and friends have dinner with Jaggers</h2>
<p>Jaggers invites Pip and his friends for dinner. Jaggers asks about Drummle, giving him a nickname of &lsquo;The Spider&rsquo;. He has an ability to read people and think what they would amount to. They have a good meal, served by the housekeeper.
When the men have an argument about strength, Jaggers makes Molly, the housekeeper to show her wrists. They look at the disfigured palms and Jaggers tells them that this is is strongest pair of wrists that he has seen.
When the conversations heat up, Jaggers dismisses them and the men go home.
A few months later, Drummle leaves Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s home and everyone seems relieved.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xxvii">Chapter XXVII</h2>
<p>Pip gets a letter from Biddy informing him that Joe is coming to London with Mr. Wopsle and he would like to visit him and if Pip is not available, he could leave a message.
Pip is not quite looking forward to the meeting since he is embarrassed by Joe. He is relieved that Joe was coming to Barnard&rsquo;s Inn and not to Hammersmith (Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s home) since he didn&rsquo;t want Drummle to meet Joe and judge Pip that he has relatives of low status.
Pip has furnished his apartment very lavishly and even has a servant whom he calls The Avenger.
Joe comes and it is evident that he is not very comfortable in the lavish settings. While they were talking Herbert comes in and is excited to see Joe and talks to him well. Joe tells them that he is in town to see Mr. Wopsle act in a play. Wopsle had left church and now was a full time actor.
After Herbert is gone, Joe tells Pip that he is actually here as a messenger. Ms. Havisham had asked to see him and that Estella was in town. She had sent a word through Pumblechook. Biddy had told Joe that it might be better to inform Pip by word than by letter.
Joe doesn&rsquo;t stay for dinner and goes away.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-xxviii">Chapter XXVIII</h2>
<p>Pip decides to pay a visit to Miss Havisham the next day. He forms many reasons why he should stay at the inn rather than at Joe’s.</p>
<p>Two convicts are being transported on the same coach as Pip. Pip recognizes one of them as the man who had given him a shilling at The Jolly Bargemen. The man doesn’t recognize Pip, and Pip tries to conceal himself to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>There is a dispute on the coach, for there is no room for the convicts except at the front. However, the passengers don’t like them so close to them. They have little choice in the matter. Pip dislikes the convict’s breath on his back. He is glad Herbert calls him Handel instead of Pip, so that the convict he recognized doesn’t hear the name.</p>
<p>Pip does wonder if he should return the convict his money. He hears the two convicts talking about someone who had two one pound notes stowed away. The convict goes on to say that this other person had asked him to give the money to a boy who had fed him and kept his secret. The prisoner had done it, and his companion tells him he was a fool. The convict Pip recognized says the man later got charged for escaping prison and got a life sentence.</p>
<p>Pip gets off at the next stop, fearing the convict will eventually recognize him. He walks the rest of the way. At the Blue Boar, he reads an article in the newspaper that gives Pumblechook credit for being the founder of Pip’s fortunes.</p>
