              <p><strong><em>The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Result</em></strong> by Gary Keller with Jay Papapsan</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.&rdquo; ~ Russian Proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is the first book that I&rsquo;m reading from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/prime-pr/ref=sv_kstore_2">&ldquo;Prime Reading&rdquo;</a> catalog. I discovered Prime reading accidentally, that too when searching for deals during thanksgiving !! It is a great offering from Amazon. I&rsquo;m amazed. I always felt that kindle/prime lending wasn&rsquo;t that great. You never got the book that you wanted, there were restrictions around one per month..etc. I thought I will stop my prime membership next year since I&rsquo;m not using prime much and haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to view movies or TV series off late. But due to &ldquo;Prime Reading&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll continue with prime for a long time, I&rsquo;m sure. It doesn&rsquo;t have a great collection yet, but I think it will come. Looking forward to a day where I can borrow books from my local library through kindle. I can borrow e-books and read from &lsquo;Overdrive&rsquo; app on my phone but still nothing matches the experience of reading from a kindle.</em></p>
<p><em>My impression of reading this book was that it was very inspiring. It is an easy, fast read, one feels like the author is an inspiring preacher who talks to you from a podium and you&rsquo;re listening to him with rapt attention. You would love the idea of focusing on one thing, timeblocking (4 hours !) and other practical steps to make life more streamlined. After reading the book, you walk away with a feeling that you&rsquo;ve gained an insight and will transform your life to follow what was said. Of course, after a few days, you go back to being the old self, being reactive to everything around and multi-tasking and not have time for anything. I think reading the notes again will re-inforce the learning and will slowly change the way you do things.</em></p>
<h2 id="highlights-from-my-kindle">Highlights from my Kindle</h2>
<p>extraordinary success is sequential, not simultaneous.</p>
<p>Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.</p>
<p>success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.</p>
<p>The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it. That’s it.</p>
<p>it takes an average of 66 days to acquire a new habit.</p>
<p>The more we use our mind, the less minding power we have.</p>
<p>The problem with living in the middle is that it prevents you from making extraordinary time commitments to anything.</p>
<p>To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. This requires getting extremely out of balance in relation to all other work issues,</p>
<p>When you act on your priority, you’ll automatically go out of balance, giving more time to one thing over another.</p>
<p>A big opportunity is better than a small one, but a small problem is better than a big one.</p>
<p>The good news is that science isn’t about guessing, but rather the art of progressing.</p>
<p>What you build today will either empower or restrict you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Achievement and abundance show up because they’re the natural outcomes of doing the right things with no limits attached.</p>
<p>A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.</p>
<p>quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question.</p>
<p>Anyone who dreams of an uncommon life eventually discovers there is no choice but to seek an uncommon approach to living it.</p>
<p>Your big ONE Thing is your purpose and your small ONE Thing is the priority you take action on to achieve it.</p>
<p>our purpose sets our priority and our priority determines the productivity our actions produce.</p>
<p>Connect today to all your tomorrows.</p>
<p>putting together a life of extraordinary results simply comes down to getting the most out of what you do, when what you do matters.</p>
<p>The people who achieve extraordinary results don’t achieve them by working more hours. They achieve them by getting more done in the hours they work.</p>
<p>When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to.</p>
<p>Actions build on action. Habits build on habit. Success builds on success.</p>
<p>when you’re aiming for success you can’t just skip to the end.</p>
<p>life worth living might be measured in many ways, but the one way that stands above all others is living a life of no regrets.</p>
<p>Put yourself together, and your world falls into place. When you bring purpose to your life, know your priorities, and achieve high productivity on the priority that matters most every day, your life makes sense and the extraordinary becomes possible. All success in life starts within you.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-1--the-one-thing">Chapter 1 : The ONE Thing</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Be like a postage stamp— stick to one thing until you get there.&rdquo; ~ Josh Billings</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key point in the chapter</strong></p>
<p>.. <em>Finally, out of desperation, I went as small as I could possibly go and asked: &ldquo;<strong>What’s the ONE Thing you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?</strong>&rdquo; And the most awesome thing happened. Results went through the roof.</em></p>
<h3 id="chapter-2--the-domino-effect">Chapter 2 : The Domino Effect</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Every great change starts like falling dominoes.&rdquo; ~ BJ Thornton</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s line up all the &lsquo;ducks in a row&rsquo; is a phrase that my previous manager AH used to use often. It does make sense. When you line up the right things, with one flick, you can start a chain reaction of great things.</em></p>
<h3 id="chapter-3--success-leaves-clues">Chapter 3 : Success Leaves Clues</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is those who concentrate on but one thing at a time who advance in this world.&rdquo; ~ Og Mandino</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.</em></p>
<p><em>When the author says &ldquo;The ONE Thing shows up time and again in the lives of the successful because it’s a fundamental truth.&quot;, I&rsquo;m reminded of the &lsquo;Matthew Effect&rsquo; from &ldquo;Outliers&rdquo; - &lsquo;To one who has, more will be given ..'&quot;</em></p>
