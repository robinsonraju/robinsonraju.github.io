    <h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>This was the first Thomas Hardy novel that I&rsquo;d read, probably during my engineering days, and re-reading it brings a lot of memories back. What I realize is that I got the gist of the story but had missed out on a lot of details that Hardy provides. Nevertheless, I had become a fan of Hardy and ended up reading almost all of his books other than Jude the Obscure. The Mayor of Casterbridge remains my favorite since it kind of resembled a Bollywood movie when I read it.</p>
<p>Hardy was not just a writer who wrote a story. He was a history buff, a traveler, an expert in birds and plants, a biblical scholar, and more importantly, a philosopher who understood human nature very well. I felt that he put in all his knowledge into the book in order to teach, and the story was just a small part of it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of references to Greek mythology throughout the novel. References to Artemis, Athena, Prometheus, Scylla and Charybdis, Zeus, Olympus, Tantalus, Ulysses, Aeneas, etc. pop up in many places. Reading these references took me back to a time when I read &lsquo;Purana Kathasagarangal&rsquo; a book of stories from Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of biblical references are found throughout. Different quotes and references from the Gospels, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Book of Samuel, Judges, etc. are found in different places. Was surprised by references like - comparison of watchman recognizing Ahimaaz&rsquo;s gait from afar to Mrs. Yeobright recognizing Clym&rsquo;s gait, Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dreams to that of Eustacia&rsquo;s, destruction of Sennacherib&rsquo;s army, and so on.</p>
<p>He refers to history of UK (Guy Fawkes, Mary Queen of Scots) , USA (Virginia, War of Independence), Greece (Alexander the Great), India (there is a reference to Begum and Warren Hastings), and so on.</p>
<p>Detailed descriptions of birds, places, plants, sometimes using botanical names, references to Darwin, are astounding.</p>
<p>Also, there are so many philosophical insights about human nature that it is remarkable and thought provoking. For instance, he says that the blessings of a well-balanced mind are happiness and mediocrity, that <em>a well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias; one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman, tortured as a heretic, or crucified as a blasphemer.</em> It made me sit and think. Viewing someone as exceptional or godly is bad for the viewer and the person!</p>
<p>Overall, it is a great read to understand many things. Though most people would read the book during their college days, I think it is best enjoyed after you have experienced many facets of human life - childhood, adolescence, marriage, children, jobs, after you have read enough history or seen enough movies/documentaries about different cultures in the world.</p>

<h2 id="book-one-the-three-women">BOOK ONE THE THREE WOMEN</h2>
<h3 id="1---a-face-on-which-time-makes-but-little-impression">1 - A Face on Which Time Makes but Little Impression</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Egdon heath is the face which has not changed over time.</p>
<p>The whole of the first chapter is an intriguing introduction to the landscape that the events in the novel are based on. It is a description of Egdon heath as a powerful force of nature, as nature itself. One can almost visualize the twilight as though one is right there. About the twilight he says, it is the time of the day where when a worker looks up, he might continue to work but when he looks down or around, he might feel like it is getting darker and is time to wind up. Hardy calls the heath as a wasteland that is vast and lonely. It has brown vegetation. But he goes on to say that is has been there since prehistoric times and has been unaltered as the stars above though everything around has changed over time. He contrasts it with the sea that is renewed frequently - &lsquo;distilled by the Sun and kneaded by the moon&rsquo;! The sea changed, the fields changed, the rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained. He gives an imposing persona to the heath.</p>
<h3 id="2---humanity-appears-upon-the-scene-hand-in-hand-with-trouble">2 - Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Reddleman appears with a woman (trouble) on his carriage. An old man who meets them on the way gets to know that there is a woman in the carriage and probably adds to the trouble.</p>
<p>A old man with a walking stick, wearing an ancient boat-cloak (cloak worn by naval officers) is seen walking alone. He sees a van far away and catches up to it. It was that of a reddleman, a person who sells reddles to the villages. Reddles are red seeds that are used to mark sheep when they are sold in fairs. The trade makes the person who sells red since the pigment spreads on clothes and skin during handling.</p>
<p>The reddleman is not much of a talker but since he keeps going to the back of the van to check upon something, the old man inquires and is told that there is a lady. The old man tries to extract more information but cannot. They part ways when the reddleman says that his ponies need to rest.</p>
<p>It is getting darker and the reddleman looks towards the horizon and sees a woman near the barrow on top of the mountain. After a short while, she goes away and more people come in.</p>
<h3 id="3---the-custom-of-the-country">3 - The Custom of the Country</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Custom of the Country is to light a bonfire on the 5th of Nov.</p>
<p>This is a long chapter and there is a good amount of dialogue in it. After the first two chapters ended with no characters being named, here many are introduced.
The group that gathered around are children, men and women of the neighboring hamlets and they&rsquo;ve come to light bonfires. Across the heath, you can see bonfires at different places and they&rsquo;re doing it to celebrate some custom. Hardy says people have been lighting bonfires since ancient times of the Druids. Even if the reasons change, the custom remains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man when, at the winter ingress, the curfew is sounded throughout Nature. It indicates a spontaneous, Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat that this recurrent season shall bring foul times, cold darkness, misery and death. Black chaos comes, and the fettered gods of the earth say, Let there be light.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people around the bonfire include Grandfer Cantle, his son Christian, Timothy Fairway, Humphrey, Sam, Susan Nunsuch, Olly Dowden. Grandfer is quite a jolly person who sings songs and dances. Christian is just over 30 yrs and says that no woman would marry him. The folks are quite superstitious and they say that he lacks virility since there was no moon when he was born. They also say that single sleepers are visited by ghosts.</p>
<p>They talk about the marriage of Thomasin Yeobright and Wildeve that was to happen earlier that day. They mean to go to Wildeve&rsquo;s inn and sing a song later. The marriage was opposed by Thomasin&rsquo;s aunt openly in the church and later she had agreed. They also mention that Mrs. Yeobright&rsquo;s son Clym is soon returning and they seem to have an admiration for him. They look at a bonfire a bit faraway that is burning steadily and mention that it might be due to wood being used. They mention that it might be by Eustacia, Captain Vye&rsquo;s granddaughter. They don&rsquo;t speak favorably of her.</p>
<p>They dance as the fire dies out, Christian gets frightened when reddleman appears who has come towards them asking the way to Mrs. Yeobright&rsquo;s house. A few minutes after the reddleman leaves, Mrs.Yeobright comes. She takes Olly and goes towards Wildeve&rsquo;s Inn, The Quite Woman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Persons with any weight of character carry, like planets, their atmospheres along with them in their orbits.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="4---the-halt-on-the-turnpike-road">4 - The Halt on the Turnpike Road</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Mrs. Yeobright halts to talk to Diggory Venn and finds out the bad news.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yeobright and Olly walk down the hill and when they reach the road Olly goes towards her home and as Mrs. Yeobright is about to enter the Inn, she sees a horse and a van nearby and the reddlemen walking alongside. She goes and talks to him to find out that her neice is no in Wildeve&rsquo;s Inn but in the carriage, that she did not get married earlier in the day as expected. Thomasin gets down from the carriage, Mrs. Yeobright and she walk toward the Inn to confront Wildeve.</p>
<h3 id="5---perplexity-among-honest-people">5 - Perplexity among Honest People</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Probably indicates the surprise in the village folk who came to dance and found Thomasin inside and not outside with Wildeve</p>
<p>She says that if he promised to marry her, he must do it, otherwise, it would bring great shame to the family. Wildeve explains that it couldn&rsquo;t happen because of an issue with licence. They had gone to Anglebury to register the marriage but since it was made out for Budmouth, it wasn&rsquo;t useful in Anglebury. Thomasin tries to defend Wildeve. She says that she was upset and decided to come back by herself and not with Wildeve and that it was not his mistake. Wildeve promises that the marriage will happen in a couple of days.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the earlier group of people come to celebrate the wedding. Wildeve asks the Yeobrights to stay in the room while he goes to entertain. He gives them drinks and chats with them. They leave and when he comes back, he finds the Yeobrights to have already left by the open window at the back.</p>
<p>He looks outside and sees one bonfire still being lit and knows that it is a sign for him. He goes towards it.</p>
<h3 id="6---the-figure-against-the-sky">6 - The Figure against the Sky</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Figure against the sky that reddleman saw was Eustacia</p>
<p>In the chapter we learn that the old man who had spoken to reddlemen was Eustacia&rsquo;s grandfather. He had put one-and-one together and informed Eustacia that probably the marriage didn&rsquo;t happen. She lights the fire to signal Wildeve to come to her thinking that he called of the wedding in the last minute because of her.</p>
<p>She has asked Johnny Nunsuch, a boy in the neighborhood to tend to the bonfire and goes once in a while to the barrow to check on Wildeve&rsquo;s Inn through a telescope and then comes back. She asks the boy if he heard a frog jump on the lake to which he replies no. Her grandfather asks her to come indoors and she says she will. After a while, the boy tells her that he heard a frog jump. She sends him off with a sixpence and we see Wildeve coming over after the boy leaves. He tells her that she does not give him peace with the lighted bonfire that does not die out. She tells that she is upset that he chose Thomasin over her. But that she is glad that he didn&rsquo;t marry due to his love for her. Wildeve explains that it was no the case and it was due to a licence issue. But they continue to chat about their love for each other. She doesn&rsquo;t allow him to kiss her though. He leaves and she goes to sleep.</p>
<h3 id="7---queen-of-night">7 - Queen of Night</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Description of Eustacia as a Queen</p>
<p>This chapter is a detailed character sketch of Eustacia. She is described as exceptionally beautiful. Her father was a bandmaster in the navy and was lucky to have married the captain&rsquo;s daughter. Her grandfather was not quite happy about it since he was from a noble family. Other aristocratic roots, comparisons to greek gods are also made. She is also portrayed as a very passionate person who has highly romantic notions in her head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Fidelity in love for fidelity&rsquo;s sake had less attraction for her than for most women; fidelity because of love&rsquo;s grip had much. A blaze of love, and extinction, was better than a lantern glimmer of the same which should last long years.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though she grew up in Budmouth, she is now at Edgon heath with her grandfather after he dad passed away. She hates being here and is always in expectation of something grand to happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To dwell on a heath without studying its meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue. The subtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia; she only caught its vapours. An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet, a suffering woman a devotee, a pious woman a psalmist, even a giddy woman thoughtful, made a rebellious woman saturnine.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="8---those-who-are-found-where-there-is-said-to-be-nobody">8 - Those Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = The boy Johnny finds Wildeve and Eustacia together and later stumbles upon Diggory Venn.</p>
<p>The boy Johnny Nunsuch is going towards his home happy with the money he got from Eustacia. On the way he gets frightened with something and decides to go back and ask Eustacia to lend a servant to walk back with him. But once he reaches there he finds Eustacia talking to Wildeve and he is caught in what Hardy calls as &lsquo;Scyllaeo-Charybdean&rsquo; position (after rock and a whirlpool in greek mythology). He decides to not disturb them, musters courage and goes towards his home.</p>
<p>On the way back, he gets frightened of something and slips and falls near Diggory Venn. Venn asks him some questions and finds out about Wildeve meeting with Eustacia.</p>
<h3 id="9---love-leads-a-shrewd-man-into-strategy">9 - Love Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Diggory Venn hatches a plan to eavesdrop on Wildeve and Eustacia.</p>
<p>Hardy explains that women used to scare their children by saying &lsquo;the reddleman is coming for you&rsquo;. He says that ordinary people don&rsquo;t take up the trade though it is vanishing. Reddlemen are wanderers like gypsies but they look down upon gypsies. Sometimes people take up the reddle trade as a penance after some wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Venn returns to his van and takes up an old letter to read. It is a letter from Thomasin where she explain why she couldn&rsquo;t marry him. She does see him that way. Looks like the spurned marriage offer is what made Venn to leave his father&rsquo;s dairy farming and go into reddle trade. He still cares for Thomasin and is upset and Eustacia and Wildeve are causing pain to her.</p>
<p>Since the boy had told him that Eustacia and Wildeve had agreed to meet on the Rainbarrow, Venn goes there daily to see if they are. The first three days pass by withouth incident. The fourth day, he sees them meet. He hides in a nearby bush and manages to overhear the conversation. Wildeve wants Eustacia to go away to America but she does not say yes or no. They depart.</p>
<p>Venn goes back to his van and decides to have a word with Eustacia.</p>
<h3 id="10---a-desperate-attempt-at-persuasion">10 - A Desperate Attempt at Persuasion</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Diggory Venn tries to persuade Eustacia</p>
<p>Venn goes to Mistover Knap first thing the next morning. He sees the grandfather at the entrance who offers him a drink. Venn says he is there to meet Ms. Vye. Since it is too early, he doesn&rsquo;t get to meet in spite of waiting for some time. So he goes outside and waits while walking around. She comes after some time. He broaches the subject of Wildeve and Thomasin but she doesn&rsquo;t take the hint. He then comes in the open an accuses her of the person who is holding the marriage by controlling Wildeve. He asks her to release Wildeve. She is shocked. But refuses by saying &ldquo;he was mine before he was hers! He came back because he liked me best!&quot;. Since he knows that she hates the heath, he even offers her employment in Budmouth through a reference from his uncle. But she still refuses.</p>
<h3 id="11---the-dishonesty-of-an-honest-woman">11 - The Dishonesty of an Honest Woman</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = Mrs. Yeobright tells Wildeve that she is going to give Thomasin to another suitor though she had said no to Diggory.</p>
<p>As Venn is walking back towards his van, he sees Mrs. Yeobright walking towards the Quiet Women to meet Wildeve. He goes over and talks to her. He doesn&rsquo;t tell her why he thinks Wildeve may not marry Thomasin since he knows that Eustacia has him fully charmed. He proposes his hand in marriage. But Mrs. Yeobright doesn&rsquo;t agree since Thomasin hadn&rsquo;t agreed two years ago.</p>
<p>With this new information, Mrs. Yeobright goes into the Inn and talks to Wildeve. In order to force his hand, she says that Thomasin has another suitor who is ready to marry her. Wildeve is surprised. Contrary to what Mrs. Yeobright expected, he doesn&rsquo;t commit.</p>
<p>Later that evening, he goes to meet Eustacia and tells her that their path is clear since Thomasin has another suitor and that she is not interested in him anymore. Eustacia is shocked by this and almost immediately loses interest in him. &ldquo;<em>What was the man worth whom a woman inferior to herself did not value?</em>&quot;, she says to herself. She doesn&rsquo;t commit and tells him that she will give a final answer on Monday at 8 by the Rainbarrrow.</p>
<p>Later that night, her grandfather returns and tells her that Mrs. Yeobright&rsquo;s son Clym Yeobright is coming home to spend Christmas with his mother. He is coming back from Paris where he had spent the last decade.</p>

The men would be Sam and Humphrey, the furze cutters, who are stacking up the furze, closely watched by Captain Vye. They&rsquo;re talking about Clym as they do their work. They&rsquo;re proud of him and hold him in high esteem. He is said to be working for a diamond merchant in Paris. After the captain leaves, they talk among themselves, saying that if there was anyone who was a match for Clym it was Eustacia.</p>
<p>Eustacia spends the whole afternoon daydreaming about Clym. Later in the evening, she decides to go and have a look at Yeobrights&rsquo; home.</p>

<h3 id="3---how-a-little-sound-produced-a-great-dream">3 - How a Little Sound Produced a Great Dream</h3>
<p><strong>Meaning of the title</strong> = A little hello from Clym in the darkness sends Eustacia&rsquo;s imagination wild.</p>
<p>Eustacia is near Blooms-End but does not see any motion or light there. As she is going back, she sees 2 women and a man coming on the way. As they reach nearer, she knows that the women and Mrs. Yeobright and her neice. The man says &ldquo;Good Night&rdquo;. Since it is darks, she is not able to hear him.</p>
<p>She thinks of the voice the whole night and has vivid dreams in the night. For the next few nights, she walks around the heath to catch a glimpse of him by some chance encounter but it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

In exchange he gets to kiss her hand.</p>
