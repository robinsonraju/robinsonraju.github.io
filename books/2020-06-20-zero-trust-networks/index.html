    <p><strong>Zero Trust Networks: Building Secure Systems in Untrusted Networks 1st Edition</strong></p>
<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>There is no better time to read this book than now. We&rsquo;re at a point in history where were have examples of massive data breaches in the past to study from, and also an unprecedented number of businesses going online at a rapid pace, accelerated by shelter-in-place rules enforced to stem the spread of covid-19 virus.</p>
<p>Folks in IT operations, especially in big companies, know that it is not easy to get ahead of the constant attacks. In spite of all the hardwork behind maintaining a centralized firewall, configuring TLS across various applications, doing penetration testing and auditing, once the perimeter is breached, there is no defense. The hosts in the internal network are in the trusted zone and rely so much on the wall that if an attacker gains access to internal network, say through phishing, then it is free-access to all the internal resources.</p>
<p>Zero-trust model is one which treats all hosts as if they’re internet-facing, and considers the entire network to be compromised and hostile.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<h2 id="1-zero-trust-fundamentals">1. Zero Trust Fundamentals</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-a-zero-trust-network">What Is a Zero Trust Network?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The assumption that systems and traffic within a datacenter can be trusted is flawed. Modern networks and usage patterns no longer echo those that made perimeter defense make sense many years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A zero trust network is built upon five fundamental assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The network is always assumed to be hostile.</li>
<li>External and internal threats exist on the network at all times.</li>
<li>Network locality is not sufficient for deciding trust in a network.</li>
<li>Every device, user, and network flow is authenticated and authorized.</li>
<li>Policies must be dynamic and calculated from as many sources of data as possible.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traditional network security architecture breaks the network into different zones, protected by firewalls. Each zone has some levels of trust. Zones that are closest to the internet, often called DMZ, have tighter controls. So, if we have different layers like the Internet (public), DMZ, Trusted and Privileged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A remote employee who is accessing the system from the Internet layer goes through VPN gateway which is in the DMZ to get access to a private service which is in the Trusted Zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An untrusted client who is accessing the system from the Internet layer through a load balancer which is in the DMZ and that internally connects to an app server which is in the Trusted zone which internally could connect to PCI server which is in the Privileged zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has a few disadvantages -</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of intra-zone traffic inspection</li>
<li>Lack of flexibility in host placement</li>
<li>Single points of failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero-trust model has authentication checks at every node regardless of its location in the network. This makes VPN redundant. The authors point out that VPN is probably the greatest backdoor that exists today.</p>
