<p>&ldquo;Daring leadership is ultimately about serving other people, not ourselves. That&rsquo;s why we choose courage.&rdquo;
~ From <strong>Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts.</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  by Brené Brown</p>
</blockquote>

</h2>
<p>It feels super inspirational to have finished this book. The book was excellent and it felt good to know that all the people who spoke highly of Brené Brown were justified in doing so. In the last few years, I&rsquo;d come across Brené Brown’s name many times, through Booklists by leaders I revered<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, YouTube feed, Amazon recommendation, etc. In a way, I was primed to read a book by Brené. So, when I chanced upon it recently, I jumped in. It was coincidental that I came across the excellent video on empathy <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> by Brené just when I started reading the book.</p>
<p>It feels natural to call the author by first name rather than the full name or the last name. After listening to the audiobook for over 8 hours, you feel like you know the author already. Or it may be due to the anecdotes in the book where she puts conversations where people call her Brené. For instance &ldquo;<em>BEN: Hey, Brené! Please pull all of the invoices together for me by four o’clock.</em>&rdquo; (Section 3 - The Armory). Throughout the book, people call her Brené and we also end up doing the same I guess. I generally prefer a book on kindle or printed since that is much faster to finish than an audiobook even at a speed of 1.25. But I’d really recommend the audiobook for this. Brené is an exceptional orator and her voice is so soothing and compelling at the same time that you feel like an esteemed teacher is right there with you, talking in person.</p>
<p>Another reason why I felt happy with the book was that it validated a lot of leadership thoughts and ideas that I had. Leadership is about bringing clarity, trusting people who work with you, empowering people, seeking constant feedback, making sure that people feel a sense of belonging, investing time ahead in planning and not pointing fingers when things go wrong, giving honest feedback from a place of vulnerability knowing that the relationship might sour, above all, putting empathy as the cornerstone of all the activities. Business goals that we achieve are for people and done by people.</p>
<p>The book has a lot of anecdotes, practical examples, and calls to action that it is useful to situations beyond the workplace. There are so many life-changing quotes in the book to ponder over. I underlined a lot of quotes and felt like I should take a print out and frame some of them. It is one of those books that when you read it and finish, you want to start reading again. I felt the same with 7 Habits (Steven Covey), 12 Rules (Jordan Peterson), Factfulness (Hans Rosling), 21 Lessons (Yuval Harari), Good to Great (Jim Collins), etc. I haven’t read other books by Brené Brown. So I was glad to hear her say that this book contains thoughts from her other books.</p>
<p>The main focus of the book is the call to become more courageous, creative, and caring; to grow through vulnerabilities and insecurities; to bring the full person to work, and not a part of the personality. Brené says that achieving workplace goals effectively and efficiently can be done without sacrificing humanity, by being trustworthy, authentic, and empathetic. She also mentions that “Rumbling with Vulnerability” is not about blindly airing your fears to everyone. The right audience needs to be told the right things.</p>
<p>There is a companion website called “Dare to Lead Hub” <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> with a lot more ways to get involved in the book with assessments, workbooks, and training. It seems like a movement in itself. Big Ideas from the book are presented in the &ldquo;The heart of daring leadership&rdquo; section in the <a href="/books/2020-10-03-dare-to-lead/#the-heart-of-daring-leadership">Introduction</a>. The notes below will give you highlights of some aspects of the book, especially the bulleted points mentioned at different places. But, &lsquo;<em>The Map is not the territory</em>&rsquo;, the summary is not the book. Reading the actual book is a totally different experience and I hope this encourages you to do so.</p>

  Notes
  <a class="anchor" href="#notes">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The title of Brené&rsquo;s earlier book <strong>Daring Greatly</strong> came from a quote by Theodore Roosevelt -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again…who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while <strong>daring greatly</strong>.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>Brené&rsquo;s goal is to take her two decades of research and experiences in hundreds of organizations to give us a practical, actionable  book about what it takes to be a daring leader.</li>
<li>I echo Brené&rsquo;s sentiment that she wants to live in a world with braver, bolder leaders, and to be able to pass that kind of world on to the next generation.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of a Leader</strong> : &ldquo;<em>Anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.</em>&rdquo;</li>

<li>We avoid tough conversations including giving honest productive feedback.</li>
<li>We spend an unreasonable amount of time managing problematic behaviors.</li>
<li>Diminishing trust caused by a lack of connection and empathy</li>
<li>Not enough people are taking smart risks or creating or sharing bold ideas.</li>
<li>We get stuck and defined by setbacks, disappointments and failures.</li>
<li>Too much shame and blame, not enough accountability and learning.</li>
<li>People fear looking wrong, saying something wrong, or being wrong.</li>
<li>When something goes wrong, individuals and teams are rushing to ineffective or unsustainable solutions.</li>
<li>Organizational values are gauzy and assessed in terms of aspirations.</li>
<li>Perfectionism and fear are preventing people from learning and growing</li>

<li>Definition of Vulnerability - &ldquo;The emotion that we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure&rdquo;. It is the courage to show up when we don&rsquo;t know the outcome.</li>
<li>Feedback needs to be authentic and should come from a place of vulnerability where the person puts himself/herself on the line.</li>
</ol>
</li>
