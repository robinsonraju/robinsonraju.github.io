Hi there! I'm **Robinson**. 
I also go by **Robin** or sometimes **Rob**. 

## About

### What do I do ? 

_I'm a Software Developer working in San Jose, CA, United States. 
As of writing this, I'm in the 14th year of working in the Software Industry and it feels like I just got started. 
I love to learn new things and it has been a grand learning experience and it continues to be so every day.
For work and education related details, please checkout my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinsonraju)._

### Who am I ?
_Though born and brought up in [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) as a [Keralite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) practicing [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malankara_Orthodox_Syrian_Church) faith, I've been influenced by multiple people and ideas. I don't quite believe in rebirth though I wish humans could download and upload memories like Cylons do in [Battlestar Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29). But I do believe that we're reborn continually and life throws similar scenarios at us so that we get a chance to do better next time. Everything - days, months, years, birthdays, anniversaries, festivals - happen in cycles and we get to relive similar moments as wiser people with time._  

_I'm grateful for having been surrounded by people and places that brought out the best in me. If you knew me many years back and find me changed with better abilities and more knowledge than before, thank the people I've had the chance to be with. I also feel very lucky for being alive at this point in time in the history of mankind. It is arguably the best era so far._ 

### What else ? 
_Other than programming, I love traveling - mainly to historic landmarks, reading (poetry, classics, sci-fi, technical and semi-technical books). I love train journeys. I also love walking long distances and hiking. I ran the SF half-marathon couple of years back and I'm looking forward to doing more of that in future._

### What's with the header image ? 
_The photo is called "**Dandelion In The Rain**" by [George Hodan](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=069205). I was browsing [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pictoquotes/13946048982/in/photostream/) for images on 'determination' and this caught my eye. Though I couldn't possibly say that I've gone through harrowing battlefield like situations and came out triumphant, I've had my challenges and this photo really struck a cord with me._

### Header image on the site
_The photo was taken by my better half and the creative force in our household, **Ashwati Kuruvilla**. It was shot while we were biking on the [Coyote Creek trail](http://www.traillink.com/trail/coyote-creek-trail-%28san-jose%29.aspx) couple of years back. It shows patches of vegetation sprouting up on a tilled land. It feels that there is more life waiting to come out of the ground and fill the whole area with greenery._

### Website
_This website is a collection of my writings on several topics, ranging from books read, places travelled, technologies learnt and some notes on software. It has taken different shapes over the years. The content has been in blogger, wordpress, google sites ..etc. So the site is also an avenue to try some new techology for me. The current site (2015) is a static site built on Jekyll & bootstrap. It uses "[Clean blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll)" theme from [startbootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com)._

## Quotes

> "Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." ~ **Calvin Coolidge**

> “Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” ~ **Goethe**

> "Don't practice until you get it right. Practice until you cannot get it wrong"

> "Somewhere in the world someone is training when you are not. When you race him, he will win." 
~ **Tom Fleming**

> "A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor."

> "When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.
Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."
~ **Steve Jobs**

> "If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them."
~ **Bruce Lee**

> "People often become what they believe themselves to be. If I believe I cannot do something, it makes me incapable of doing it. But when I believe I can, then I acquire the ability to do it even if I didn't have it in the beginning."
~ **Mahathma Gandhi**

> "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently." 
~ **Henry Ford**

> "Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but of playing a poor hand well." 
~ **Robert L. Stevenson**

> "You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only option left."

> "Be the change you want to see."
~ **Mahatma Gandhi**

> "In any compromise between food and poison, it is only death that can win. In any compromise between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit."
~ **Ayn Rand**

> "Work banishes those three great evils: boredom, vice and poverty."
~ **Voltaire**

> "Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor."
~ **Truman Capote**

> “Believe in your dreams and they may come true; believe in yourself and they will come true”

> "Look at the clock when you waste your time, Running in it is not pin of the clock but your life."
