Hi, My name is Robinson (people call me Robin). I'm a Software Engineer working in San Jose, Calif, United States. Other than programming, I love traveling - mainly to historic landmarks, reading (poetry, classics, sci-fi, technical and semi-technical books) and doing research on topics that interest me, though 'research' is limited to Wikipedia reading nowadays.
