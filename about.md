Hi there! I'm **Robinson**. 
I also go by **Robin** or sometimes **Rob**. 

### What do I do ? 

_I'm a Software Developer working in San Jose, CA, United States. 
As of writing this, I'm in the 14th year of working in the Software Industry and it feels like I just got started. 
I love to learn new things and it has been a grand learning experience and it continues to be so every day.
For work and education related details, please checkout my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinsonraju)._

### Who am I ?
_Though born and brought up in [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore) as a [Keralite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) practicing [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malankara_Orthodox_Syrian_Church) faith, I've been influenced by multiple people and ideas. I don't quite believe in rebirth though I wish humans could download and upload memories like Cylons do in [Battlestar Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29). But I do believe that we're reborn continually and life throws similar scenarios at us so that we get a chance to do better next time. Everything - days, months, years, birthdays, anniversaries, festivals - happen in cycles and we get to relive similar moments as wiser people with time._  

_I'm grateful for having been surrounded by people and places that brought out the best in me. If you knew me many years back and find me changed with better abilities and more knowledge than before, thank the people I've had the chance to be with. I also feel very lucky for being alive at this point in time in the history of mankind. It is arguably the best era so far._ 

### What else ? 
_Other than programming, I love traveling - mainly to historic landmarks, reading (poetry, classics, sci-fi, technical and semi-technical books). I love train journeys. I also love walking long distances and hiking. I ran the SF half-marathon couple of years back and I'm looking forward to doing more of that in future._

### What's with the header image ? 
_The photo is called "**Dandelion In The Rain**" by [George Hodan](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=069205). I was browsing [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pictoquotes/13946048982/in/photostream/) for images on 'determination' and this caught my eye. Though I couldn't possibly say that I've gone through harrowing battlefield like situations and came out triumphant, I've had my challenges and this photo really struck a cord with me._

### Header image on the site
_The photo was taken by my better half and the creative force in our household, **Ashwati Kuruvilla**. It was shot while we were biking on the [Coyote Creek trail](http://www.traillink.com/trail/coyote-creek-trail-%28san-jose%29.aspx) couple of years back. It shows patches of vegetation sprouting up on a tilled land. It feels that there is more life waiting to come out of the ground and fill the whole area with greenery._

### Website
_This website is a collection of my writings on several topics, ranging from books read, places travelled, technologies learnt and some notes on software. It has taken different shapes over the years. The content has been in blogger, wordpress, google sites ..etc. So the site is also an avenue to try some new techology for me. The current site (2015) is a static site built on Jekyll & bootstrap. It uses "[Clean blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll)" theme from [startbootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com)._
